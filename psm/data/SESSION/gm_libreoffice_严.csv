The check nCol == -1 in ScAttrArray methods is to prevent making calls to pDocument methods like InvalidateTextWidth() from aNextColAttrArray as it requires a valid/existing Column.The special cases in the ScAttrArray methods are in fact for the case of default formatting where nCount == 0 and pData == nullptr."

As far as I read the code the default formatting is stored in the ScTable instance. If these methods are supposed to be never called for the default formatting I think an assert is the better solution.Sorry that it currently takes me a bit longer to review patches. I'm quite busy with my thesis and can not afford to spend too much time on LibreOffice."

If these methods are supposed to be never called > for the default formatting I think an assert is the better > solution.As per the current patch the default formatting is not stored in any of the ScAttrArray objects (in ScTable and in ScColumn), it is used only when required, by callingpDocument->GetDefPattern(). When an ScAttrArray object is constructed, by default it is set empty that is,  pData <- nullptr and nCount <- 0which is indicative of the default format. If default formatting is stored inScTable instance, for a new document if user adds new content for say first N columnswithout any formatting, then the first N ScColumn instances of ScAttrArray will getcreated by copying the default formatting from the ScTable instance. This can be avoidedby making ScTable's ScAttrArray instance be empty by default indicating default formatting.But the penalty is we have to add special cases everywhere for ScAttrArray methods. But I am not sure if we want this. Should we revert to ScTable instance storing the def.formatting ? - it would make the code simpler."
233,0,"Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1(7 comments)So.. with the third attempt to review I finally managed to wrap my head around this.. ;-)I think having the aNextColAttrArray for unallocated columns at ScTable is a good approach.

Calling any document content related functions for the unallocated column clearly must not happen.Overall I'm impressed, you seem to have dug deeply into this.I have some inline comments about some minor changes. Once these are done, do you think this would be ready to be added for 5.3?"

Calling any document content related functions for > the unallocated column clearly must not happen.Hi EikeThanks a lot for the review. Just to clarify regarding the nCol != -1 check, we need to let methods like Reset(), SetPatternArea(), ApplyStyleArea() to be called for the aNextColAttrArray but *without* changing any document content. An alternative to nCol != -1 checks is that we can have a default parameter or data member called bUnallocated with default value = false for all such methods and use that instead of (nCol != -1) when calling from aNextColAttrArray. Would that be better at least in terms of readability of the code ?In the meantime I will fix the other issues as per your comments. Thanks."

249,0,"Patch Set 5:> (5 comments) >  > Starts to look good. Confirm you have tested it and it works well > now?Not perfect yet. It works well for a pre-defined table created with direct sql like:CREATE TABLE ""myTable"" (""id"" INTEGER NOT NULL,""decNumber"" DECIMAL(9,3), PRIMARY KEY  (""id""))But in the Table Design GUI I still cannot change the field properties ""Decimal places"" and ""Length"". The sql statement generated after creating a table with a decimal in it looks like:CREATE TABLE ""myTable"" (""id"" INTEGER NOT NULL,""decNum"" DECIMAL, PRIMARY KEY  (""id""))So (precision, scale) part is missing. I think this part is missing in Tables::createStandardColumnPart, and I can fix it.But I still don't know why are the property fields not editable. There may be some settings somewhere to enable it, and I could query those numbers through PROPERTY_ID_SCALE and PROPERTY_ID_PRECISION..."

There is a TON of code that could be removed if one really wants to strip all of this ""require a border"" code.

This effectively changesALLOW_PADDING_WITHOUT_BORDERS into a preventative compatibility settinginstead of an enabling one.If an AllowPaddingWithoutBorders=false case is ever found, additional codewill be needed to send the SID_ALLOW_PADDING_WITHOUT_BORDERS setting foreach type of border (page, paragraph, image etc).

2100,1,"Patch Set 1:not in both places?  Ideally eventually it can be fixed...I don't take reverting a unit test lightly, but this one has always been a complete thorn and I'm convinced that keeping in the code that allows it to currently pass is detrimental.  Thus the slightly modified unit test which looks terrible on released versions of 5.x, and mostly correct with all the changes in 5.3.  It certainly is WRONG before this patch hits, so it is a toss-up of one unit test verses another.With the regular page-break, it would be possible to switch to the follow style at that point (which in some cases would be too late, but better than nothing), but doing so has given me round-trip problems that I haven't been able to solve yet.  So one step at a time, and at least get this in before 5.3 releases."

But it's not a trivial change, and it has been always like this, so not urgent... :-)The fact that in RTF it's OK to specify table properties after the contents of the table, while OOXML specifies it before (and because of this, the RTF tokenizer has to buffer the table contents) is just a cherry on the ""cake""."

I'm not sure of the reasons for that, or if it is just historical cruft that has no reason to be anymore.I thought about just converting this (potentially unreachable) case to bookmarks, but getting the n_th row's bookmark is not immediately obvious... It requires moving the seek cursor (which can muck with expectations of other code about where the cursor is...). The safest would be to make a clone of the resultset and use that to get a bookmark,Anyway, this change is good to go as far as I'm concerned."

3115,1,"Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1(4 comments)Looks good so far, but there is small problem with default creation:As soon as you override the CreateDefaultObject method, what happens is that SwFEShell::CreateDefaultShape is never called for all SIDs that use ConstRectangle. So:1. SwFEShell::CreateDefaultShape has code that previously handled line creation (OBJ_LINE case), and now it becomes unused.2. Some SIDs aren't properly handled in the new CreateDefaultObject, so e.g. if you create a textbox, it created outside the page, then ""jumps"" into its place.We have now 2 options:1. Implement support for all ConstRectangle based SIDs into CreateDefaultObject, and remove the unused code from SwFEShell::CreateDefaultShape.2. Not override CreateDefaultObject, and instead implement everything in SwFEShell::CreateDefaultShape."

3124,1,"Patch Set 2:Apparently, canvas sizes were integers. So, integer division was producing wrong results in that case. Also, as you say having a radio button makes more sense, that is what I tried at first. But things quickly broke, because there are other cases (like 4 images in a slide), which use check boxes. Fitting those 4 images on canvas would actually require cropping. That can be done in future.

I, or may be > someone else, might pass actual Media Path there.Come on, you can do it ;-) it is trivial by now, when you got this farImplement a new method of MediaControl class, e.g. implUpdateURLField (it could take OUString as an argument). It should do mpMediaPath->SetText($some_url), where $some_url you're going to obtain from maItem (avmedia::MediaItem) member variable, by simply calling its getURL() method. Call this method from MediaControl::setState(). That's it."
3268,1,"Patch Set 2:I did as you said. There is one problem though. The toolbox doesn't resize after it gets updated with media path. I might be missing something silly. I did call Resize function, but to no avail. There is a weird overlapping of items in the toolbox."

3270,1,"Patch Set 2:I'm unable to get the resize function to work. Other mentioned things can be quite easily implemented. The problem is that the media URL is not set the time when we setText() mpMediaPath to ""Insert Media Path Here"". Although media URL is set by the time setState() is called, but I'm only able to update the text of mpMediaPath from there but not the width, which results in cutoff text/overlapping elements. I had implemented this taking into consideration, the example of <TextEdit>mpTimeEdit, which seemed similar in function that it displayed some text. But, it never needs to change it's width, when set once. Not so with mpMediaPath. If there is any example of a <TextEdit>/<FixedText> that updates it's width during runtime, I might be able to do this in a similar way."
3272,1,"Patch Set 3:Made the mentioned changes. For the time being, I've just increased the initialised size of <FixedText>. This of course is not the solution, but will do for the moment.

In this mode, all contextual toolbar should be disabled (https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=92218#c13).For sidebar mode, the sidbear should be fully opened whatever state it is in and set to the properties tab.For notebookbar mode, the sidebar should be collapsed to show the 'show' arrrow button, similar to single toolbar mode."

(either redirect directly to askbot or show a overview page, depending on language. That then can be maintained/updated independently from LO (you cannot change the hardcoded URLs in a released version of LO after all)so again:* make it a generic page instead (not ""Questions and Answers"" but something like ""Get help online"" or something similar)* all URLs in LibreOffice itself should be http://hub.libreoffice.org/something ones.definite -2 because of the special handling of locales, without it it would still be a fat -1 from me"

4915,1,"Patch Set 3:(2 comments)Removal of the binary table autoformat load/save code sounds a bit brave to me. Sure, table autoformat will be mostly useless for new users when the table styles UI is ready, but we have to take care of old users as well, possibly having valuable data in their user profile."
4917,1,Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1(1 comment)I agree. I'll revert then to two table styles containers (document one and autoformat window one). The document one will be populated upon document creation.
4919,1,"Patch Set 3:I think in the long run it'll be OK to deprecate and then remove the table autoformat UI (and the binary table autoformat configuration in the user profile), but not before the table style UI is ready, and we're not there yet. So we need some kind of compromise to allow you continuing towards a complete table style UI while not breaking existing users of the table autoformat.As far as I see the root of this conflict is that on one hand you want to use the autoformat dialog for the purposes of applying a table style (and displaying table style previews), while existing users want to display their existing table autoformats there.How about this:- add a new non-optional bool parameter to the SwAutoFormatDlg ctor (right after pShell, so the compiler will point out all call sites for you) named e.g. bTableStyle, and if it's true, then let it behave the way you need it; if it's false, then let it behave it did in the past- when creating the dialog via Table -> AutoFormat, then set the new flag to false, i.e. load and save the binary thing from/to the user profile, as before. if a table autoformat would be applied, first copy (and overwrite if necessary) the autoformat from the dialog's container to the document's container, so the style preview and actual document rendering matches- when creating the dialog from a future ""click on the table style name in the table style list in the sidebar, and right click -> 'new' or 'modify'"", then set the new flag to true: the user profile would be ignored in this case, and it would behave the way you want it.Does this make sense?And again, in the long run, that would mean getting rid of the table -> autostyle menu entry, when all style functionality is available via the styles and formatting thing already."

5014,1,"Patch Set 1:Yes, seeing that we have checks like: rAppendContext.pLastParagraphProperties->GetvAnchor() >= 0already in the code, that suggests that it's assumed that the default is -1.

5015,1,Patch Set 1:the commit Caolan referred to is one that ADDs a new resetFrameProperties function.  The original change away from -1 default is commit 20c1a485774c7586401f6c1821c52f0bc39cb84a as mentioned in the commit message.

What a nonsense..So that should be changed from double fF to bool bF and all functions calling ScGetZw() should obtain the argument value using GetBool() instead of GetDouble().We probably will have to mention that change in the release notes, because it may alter calculation results, even if from wrong to right ..."

6812,0,Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1Love it - thanks for the swamp draining Markus ! =) I guess my lingering concern is what happens when we have SEH enabled code that catches a SEGV vs. normal code - does that mean we get various exceptions thrown out of eg. OGL drivers that are compiled with this option (?) etc. anyhow - moving closer to the Linux case sounds like a good idea to me for window stability =)Thanks.

It does not affect how other code handles it. Of course if we get a lot of SEH excepions from outside of our control that are currently caught in one of the catch all handlers we are going to crash a lot.EHs has basically two effects on the code. catch(...) will not catch SEH exceptions and there is no stack nwinding and destructor calls going to be for SEH exceptions.I think both are fine in our code. The case that some external part is handling SEH with EHa should not concern us as if we get a SEH from that cod ewe will just crash and if that code handles it we are not going to see it anyway.
6824,1,"Patch Set 1:But AFAIS the window of time for the race already opens after  if (osl_atomic_decrement( &m_refCount ) == 0) {in OWeakObject::release, not only after  MutexGuard aGuard(getWeakMutex());in OWeakConnectionPoint::dispose.

7122,0,Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1(1 comment)This commit needs to be split into at least 2 if not more patches.This mixes so many things (even if they are all related to validation). E.g. I'm unhappy with the DOCX part in the chart test unless someone is going to maintain them. I'm happy to maintain the calc parts and as far as I know I'm the only one really caring about the chart tests.At least all the non binary validation changes in the chart code need to go into an independent patch that can be discussed independently. With the current chart change this -1 should be seen as meaning a -2 with the chance to remove the -1 by splitting the unrelated parts into an own commit.For the calc part it is surely not the best idea to add uncommented code when are actually discouraging that. Hide it behind a ifdef or something like that to make it clearer that it is actually useful and should not be removed directly.

Also, it should go into its own test function and committed separately from the invalidatetile (and it probably doesn't belong in this file anyway (should be in httpwstest.cpp).Regarding the empty docs, the typical way of getting an empty do is to load one of the existing, selectall, delete.

So it represents the opposite, waiting for the user to do something, and not for a task that's running in the background.I initially wanted a circle spinner around the FAB, but gave up before I got it working...For stuff like this I see no problem using different animations depending on the android version, it is no critical thing, doesn't  involve program or makes it not work on other systems.

8447,1,"Patch Set 2:As discussed on IRC:os_cib: Sweet5hark: I read it. The idea of the method you want to remove is to be able to redirect. The marked regression does that to provide a WESTERN/CJK/CTL state to the font attribute slots depending on the script type. To me this is a perfectly valid use case. If you remove this method all those places require the creation of an additional temporary object just to be able to 're-Which' it. Sweet5hark: os_cib: thats worth it, because what happens in the itemset right now is even worse: when you put s WESTERN font item in a itemset in the CJK slot, the item will still have the WESTERN which-id. so when you go to the itemset and ask it for a CJK item, you actually get one with a WESTERN which-id. and when you innocently put that somewhere else (assuming it is a CJK) with Put(item), it will end up setting over the WESTERN item, not the CJK one.Sweet5hark: os_cib: thats clearly insane and likely the source of quite a few bugs we ignore because CJK isnt too mainstream.Sweet5hark: os_cib: the temporaries are not nice, but likely can be resolved later. at least they not actively conspire against the reader of the code to do something nasty instead of the expected.Sweet5hark: os_cib: if you have an alternative that makes sure that if you do a pItemSet->Get(nWhichId) you get an item with rItem.GetWhich() == nWhichId feel free to suggest.Sweet5hark: os_cib: do you get what I was aiming for now? an alterntive would be for Put(item, nWhich) to punch over the which id of the item in the set -- but I wasnt sure if _that_ would have caused regressions, thus I wrote the original bug like that.os_cib: Sweet5hark: I'm actually surprised that 'my' use case puts items into the set that carry a differnt which id than the their position requires. It should not be hard to fix.s_cib: While at it I found another use case - not handled by the patch. InvalideItem() calls Put() with a VoidItem with which==0 and the ... then uses the other which id to find the right place.Sweet5hark: os_cib: well, invalid items should be an implementation detail of the set. it shouldnt need public functions for that.Sweet5hark: os_cib: if you want to make the itemset punching over the which-id of items stored in it, so that the which member in the item is the same as the position in the set, go for it. Back then I was afraid of possible regressions from that change, as some code might implicitly rely on that.Sweet5hark: os_cib: as long as the end result is ""an item at a position in a set actually also has than nWhich"", Im happy.Sweet5hark: s/it shouldnt need public functions for that./the implementation of invalidate shouldnt need to call public functions of set./So -- not objecting if Oliver prefers a different solution, if Noel is ok with that. (tdf#34465 should then be updated or closed)"

8687,1,"Patch Set 1:Note that the reason I removed some of the private default constructors, instead of marking them ""= delete"" is that they are redundant: if a class declares one or more constructors, then the compiler will not generate a default constructor.Possibly I should write a plugin for this and do it in a separate patch."

8744,1,Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1+2About ZA I believe it is an important update to include since the current version is very outdatedI got in contact with its author a month or two ago (Dwayne Bailey) who told me that the version in Mozilla (Firefox & Thunderbird) were his latest release (2012-07-10). So I added this version to the OXT.A few months ago I also got in contact with the NZ guy (Tristan Burtenshaw) but he said he would reply to me in the following week but he never did. Tristan had a GB thesaurus in his OXT (the current OXT uses US thesaurus for all English variants).
8751,0,"Patch Set 3:(3 comments)Overally, pretty good job. For some nitpicks see inline comments"
8769,1,"Patch Set 2:Hi Faruk,Thanks for working on this, it looks awesome, except I have few comments that I think should be taken care of before we merge this. What do you think ?1. tpstatus label is obscured; not clearly visible. Maybe better if we add a background below this label, or something to make it visible clearly ?2. It should be possible to close the dialog when user clicks somewhere else. Currently, only way to close the dialog is to hit again on the toolbar button.3. I think we should limit the dimensions of table user can create with this new toolbar button just like we do in desktop, because if we don't it would stick to the mouse movements and user will have a hard time to find an empty space to close the dialog button. This is pretty annoying from user POV, I think.4. I noticed that the state of this new toolbar button doesn't get reset whenever user manages to close the dialog. So for eg: if user closed the dialog with table dimensions 12 x 12 selected, the next time he opens it, it would still be at 12 x 12. The state should be reset everytime dialog is closed.5. Currently, user has to move his mouse slowly to select desired dimensions. If he moves the mouse little faster, the dialog doesn't notice that.6. You have limited the width of dialog unlike its height. I think you intend to limit the number of columns user can choose here (?), _but_ if user moves his mouse back and forth near the right edge, more number of columns gets added to the same width increasing the number of cells per row - density - which makes the grid a mess. Can we somehow avoid that ? Also as pointed out in (3) limiting number of rows makes sense here.Besides these, I found a missing '+' (see inline comments which makes me suspect this is not the version you have in your local box since this version doesn't work out of the box unless someone changes code himself - is it ?)"

8811,1,Patch Set 11: Code-Review+2I'm still not happy with the whole approach as I think it is not something we want to do. I would have most likely only given a warning to the user that we had some problems fitting his text and not bothered with anything else. IMHO we are trying to be too clever for our own good with this algorithm.However I don't care enough to block this patch. This message should be enough encouragement for anyone who wants to revert that behavior.
8814,1,"Patch Set 8:(21 comments)So I have one general comment related to the concept and a few related to the actual implementation.I'm not sure if that is really a good approach. In general I think instead of trying to change the equation we should make it clear to the user that we could not layout his chart correctly and that he should look into fixing the layout. So a more make the user aware of the problems than trying to work around problems.I suggest that you contact the UX team and tell them about your idea and my concerns.Related to the code:I'm not happy with some of the special values, especially the use of 0 as formula length to signal that the formula length can be ignored. I think a cleaner solution is something like sal_Int32* pFormulaLength = NULL and require the caller to use a NULL pointer to signal that the parameter needs to be ignored. That makes IMHO the code cleaner as it is directly obvious that we are not talking about a zero length string.I'd also like to see a comment why the aValueString checks are necessary despite the earlier checks that this value is not handled in that place.I'm going to look into the localization issue that I saw as that looks like a serious problem.And finally I was unable to follow all corner cases in the new code. So if we are really going to merge this code, I'd like to see a unit test for nearly all special cases. Additionally a few comments explaining what we are doing would be helpful. Currently it is nearly impossible to figure out why some cases need special handling. An exmaple for that (which I have still no idea why it is correct) is that in one case we multiply nFormulaLength by 2 if aValueString is ""1"".This was a really review and I suggest that you start by talking to the UX guys. If they have more questions they can contact me."

I've placed this file in include/sfx2 because all .hxx files related to the template manager are there.It's not for filter combobox right now but will be used later in it's functionality.

8948,0,"Patch Set 3:Hi,I think you convert too much.When you add a method SdrGrafObj::getOriginalSize() it should return the size in the same units the SdrModel is defined in. This is not always 100thMM. In Draw/Impress/Calc it is, but in Writer it is Twips. So the method has to convert to the units of the SdrModel used, you can get that using GetModel()->GetScaleUnit() in/at the SdrObject which gives you the target MapUnit. Looks as if the original code you copied did not do that, but that is okay since it originally was only used in sd. With a method at SdrGrafObj it has to be done correct since e.g. it can be called in the future in Writer code and has to convert to Twips then.It is not needed to hand over the SdrObject again to the getOriginalSize() implementation as parameter, use the local C++ this ptr which is already the SdrGrafObj from which you need the size.In drviews7, the call to GetLogicRect() will already return the data in the model units, so I think the conversion there to 100thMM is not needed at all, just compare aRect.GetSize() with pSdrGrafObj->getOriginalSize, that should then compare both sizes in the same, correct model units.HTH!"

That was the main reason I did it that way.There is also another reason: This is not only about files w/o CODEPAGE, but also about files with *wrong* CODEPAGE (and also *wrong* data in the FONT record), e.g tdf#37408, tdf#90210.There are lots of 3rd party apps the create BIFF5 files, manyof them are broken in different ways.

9271,0,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2As Michael says the motivation behind this service is that in case an out-of-process UNO client registers a dispatch provider, then on startup the ~200 uno commands are queried a number of times -- and that's a lot of traffic, when the use case is that most of these commands are disabled, and only a few of them is forwarded to the salve dispatcher or handled directly. With this service, it's possible to handle most of the commands directly in core via cheap c++ virtual member function calls (vs. more expensive C++ <-> URP <-> external client ones, and the same marshaling + parsing back with the result). The configuration-based approach is great if you want to make these changes permanent -- this one doesn't touch the configuration, so the effect can be dynamic, and is automatically thrown away when the process ends.So to sum up, it seems to me the two are not conflicting, they rather complement each other."

(e.g. ""Own Theme (Office 2003 for LibreOffice)"" )Regarding the adding of a firefox theme url in the field, we need to make a few changes.1) When clicking the 'Search' button, it should download the theme, apply it, and close the dialog without any other user interaction.2) We should change the button label from 'Search' to 'Go', so it make sense in scenarios."

(The Diagnostic field is intended to pass through additional, protocol-dependent information from a server, which necessarily needs to be non-localized.)  For another, it only addresses the cmis UCP, not other UCPs using the AuthenticationRequest in a similar way, ftp and webdav.In f88554edd46d2dc8d6c8eaba74c89ccd3e537104 ""Related tdf#98644: In login dialog, give a hint that the password was wrong"" I have now extended the uui's (GUI) AuthenticationRequest handler, to give a better hint that a login dialog is presented to the user because the previously entered password was wrong.I would suggest to drop from this change those parts that set a localized ""wrong password"" hint in the AuthenticationRequest's Diagnostic field, and instead just make sure that the AuthenticationRequest's Password field is set when an old, wrong password from a previous, failed login attempt is already available."

If the client code (on purpose) passes in no interaction handler for some command to the UCP, and the UCP gets into a situation where it would want to consult a passed-in interaction handler, then the UCP must abort the command by throwing an exception back to the client, instead of creating its own interaction handler out of thin air."

10348,1,"Patch Set 6:> But that doesn't answer my question:  What is the problem this > change wants to solve?I'll try to give an explanation, by describing what happens.Please have a look at this gerrit already pushed (originally it was in the same series with this one):https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/gitweb?p=core.git;a=commitdiff;h=e1ae21889a214ea3b6f79018d3c710d75fc8fba6probably I should have kept both merged in a single gerrit patch set.Anyway, Kendy description I removed explained what this patch fixes.This is the callback Kenky is referring to in his comment (NeonSession_CertificationNotify):http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/ucb/source/ucp/webdav-neon/NeonSession.cxx#354in this callback, here:http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/ucb/source/ucp/webdav-neon/NeonSession.cxx#455the interaction handler is needed because it's the only way the user is notified that something went wrong during web connection because of SSL certificate problem.If a CommandEnv is available, the certificate is further checked, the real check is performed here:http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/uui/source/iahndl-ssl.cxx#248In handleCertificateValidationRequest_  the user is asked if the certificate can be trusted anyway, should some of the checks carried out there fails.Upon returning of a successfull interaction '0' is returned to neon, which go on processing the request.In the use case addressed with the patch (e.g. accessing a mozilla web site) the user interaction is not called, because the test Kendy reports as failing(""In the case of services.addons.mozilla.com, the certificate is for versioncheck.addons.mozilla.com, but it also has..."") is addressed inside handleCertificateValidationRequest_starting here:http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/uui/source/iahndl-ssl.cxx#276down to this last check:http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/uui/source/iahndl-ssl.cxx#300That can't be done if CommandEnv is missing.If this patch is not present, NeonSession_CertificationNotify always returns '1', returning '1' to neon, neon will stop the processing notifiying the caller 'Server certificate verification failed: issuer is not trusted',which in due time it's converted to a 'ucb::InteractiveNetworkReadException'.The root call to access file is this:http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/cui/source/options/personalization.cxx#582As you can see the catch clause doesn't deal with the exception mentioned above, and besides, nothing can be done by the UCB client if SSL certificates aresuspicious or wrong or in need of a deeper check.The missing CommandEnv is common in UCB client use of Web/WebDAV connection, what do we do when we end up with the same problem, about certificates?Or in another possibility, not yet addressed, if the remote web server challenges to obtain credentials and no interaction handler is available to serve them?"

As I think we will never advertise such a build configuration (IMHO the concept is completely broken (either OpenGL is an optional dependency and no mandatory feature may depend on it or there is no need to make anything optional based on OpenGL)) you should make sure that there is a big warning in the configure output that nobody using this configuration can expect any help or support from the project. In general I think that adding that many #if statements that are not localized is a bad idea but as far as I know I'm the only one with sub objections.

This build configuration without dependencies to libraries not available on typical server installations has been around for ages. End users will of course not use them. But you are right that features that are needed to load/save/print/API-manipulate documents  should not depend on 'optional' libraries or should have a headless alternative.

Currently OpenGL is accepted as a dependency of LibreOffice and we have been adding features based on OpenGL so we should not make it optional. Any change to this policy would need to go through the ESC.
11378,1,"Patch Set 7:The request from the ESC was to evaluate whether we cannot do this as a rather trivial patch to glew/ itself.Was there any traction with that approach - it should be a few lines, of nice, isolated, maintainable work that doesn't give the impression that GL is going to be optional in future =)"
11419,1,Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1I rather like this =)Please bear in mind that you don't -really- need to have the virtual methods / overrides and the instance (I think) - since you will only ever have a single type of this per compiled-in platform variant.Then again - they do little harm.I suspect Stephan would have some esthetic comments here too =)
11421,1,"Patch Set 3:Yeah, I wanted to make it without classes too, but it looked more difficult, because these functions call other functions that need to be implemented for each platform (init/deInit/...) and so on.I guess I should try it again =)"

See bridges/inc/bridges/cpp_uno/shared/vtablefactory.hxx for an example of a (non-virtual) C++ class VtableFactory that leaves some of its member functions (that all happen to be static, but that's irrelevant here) to be implemented per-platform."
11423,1,"Patch Set 2:What do you mean about virtual methods / overrides? I didn't see any better option that would allow to reduce code duplication :)The instance method/singleton, I added it because I need to pass C-style function to OS APIs instead of non-static class method. And inside that function I need to access the class members (callSignalHandler, etc.), so I cannot just make it static.Though maybe it is possible to make all class members static, but I think I saw some difficulties with this approach too..."

It might be that green and red mean something like 'this should work, this not' that I do not know. I did not compare to current state without your change yet, so cannot say if it got better/worse, will do so now.For automatic comparison (test case): Hm. That would need to compare against PPT state or against a saved PPT state.

I suppose other improvements should go in follow-ups, don't you agree? > It might be that green and > red mean something like 'this should work, this not' that I do not > know.No, I have mislead you with these colours; I only wanted to make things distinguishable. > For automatic comparison (test case): Hm.

If I'll be able to probrammatically generate a bitmap (preferably to file), I'll try to generate a reference bitmap from MSO to be able to test this; however, that would be silly to expect pixel-to-pixel match.

11784,0,"Patch Set 3:Thanks Armin, Thorsten!1. I'm not very familiar with therminology. Could you please tell me what to use as CustomShape? Will MS Impress Rectangle do? (I see that I can use OLE/bitmap as non-CS.)2. As to unit test: I already looked for a way to make one. I cannot invent it: testing the adjustment feels not right, because the desired view may be attained differently. I thought of a way of creating a bitmap of the slide, and check if top part of it contain black pixels at defined positions... That would definitely say something about the correctness of the display.Maybe there's a way to know the actual position text is written to?"
11787,1,"Patch Set 3:> Any of the more complex shapes (cloud, heart etc) will doThanks; I've made up a test document attached to original issue. Testing in, my patch doesn't cause any regressions.

If you're > unsure, you can check coordinates with a bit of fuzziness.I'm sorry, but that unit test seems useless here, because it just checks colors of a table's cells, not of ""screen pixels"". I think that I should look into tiled rendering; I would be most thankful to someone pointing me to how can I get a tile of desired part of draw page to analyse it?"
11788,0,"Patch Set 1:The problem in tdf#93124 is the following:1. The title text is aligned vertically to bottom, and its height is greater than its rectangle.2. In this case, when text isn't aligned to full width of the object, it ignores the vertical anchor setting (be it to middle or bottom), and aligns vertically to top. So, to retain correct position, the text must be aligned to full width.3. Full width alignment is only available when horisontal alignment is to center.4. All paragraphs in the text box are aligned to left, so LO ""optimizes"" the text object alignment to left bottom corner, thus disabling full width setting, and breaks the test position.Another approach could be to either allow full width for any horisontal alignment, or to fix incorrect anchoring in case when text height is greater than the rectangle (IMO, the latter is preferable). But that change is much more invasive, and I suppose that removing the optimization (lines 898-922 and 952-976) that uses word ""sensible"", i.e. it's not mandatory, just intended to be more performant (?) in some cases, may be more suitable here.Also, the line 1034 makes some kinds of text objects to auto-align its contents to the box. As may be seen in tdf#41245, that's not correct, so I removed it. If auto-fit is to be used on import, it must be enabled only when PPT specifies that explicitly.And even with the previous fix, some objects keep getting auto-fit flag just because the template specifies that, and that's why I needed to explicitly override it in 1093-1100. If later the auto-fit is to be enabled, it's the place where we should check for PPT (explicit) auto-fit setting, and enable it if set, and keep disabling otherwise."

To be clear: with or without reverted commit A I cannot reproduce the problem of fdo#69244 with the attachment of fdo#69244.That makes me think that reverting commit A should be safe; AFAIK there was no performance goal of commit A.As this is an annoying/confusing bug, I would like the backport it to 5.0 and 5.1.The recalculation process with SetDirty and FormulaTree in unfamiliar terrain for me, I may well overlook important negative consequences."

I'll push this.What could get an enhancement, now that only empty cells in the data area are found, is that the dialog displaying the search result normally has a list of cells, that when searching for empty cells is empty because there are no cells to display. So maybe that could be populated with the list of found positions in the FindAll case as they are selected after the Find? If not, then suppress the dialog. Displaying a dialog with an empty list is misleading."
12171,1,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1(1 comment)While this generally works there is some odd behavior if an area was selected and ""Current selection only"" checked. The result includes unrelated empty cells not part of the data area (note that the result should not include all empty cells of the sheet..) if the selection started left or above the actual data area.For example, data in C5 and C7 and C9, select B4:C9 and search string ^$ in selection only, Find All, and see columns A:B selected and also C1:C4.Witch ""Current selection only"" unchecked and Find All the result is correct. also if the selection does not start left or above the data area.Probably SearchAndReplaceEmptyCells() has a broken range detection."

12547,1,"Patch Set 6:Thank you for your comments, I will look into them and correct the code where possible.In general:-I switched from vector< double > to array of doubles in an attempt to improve performance; but didn't try to measure the difference; I haven't looked into leaks and leak-protection, so I may switch them back to vector.-Some vectors were maintained as they are sorted or have to passed as vector to existing functions.-I now have 8 new functions, of which Excel doesn't have 3 (the multiplicative method, which is more realistic and IMHO of more use when forecasting). These 3 functions don't have an _xlfn prefix in OOXML as they don't exist there. I haven't fully checked yet if all entries in formulabase.cxx and xlformula.cxx are correct here.-My main efforts so far have been to get the functions working as they should (and changing constraints where MS Excel preaches them but does _not_ apply them).I want to change one last constraint (the time(X)-interval needs to be constant, but in case of dates an interval of months (28 to 31 days) is accepted by Excel. I have to find out how much deviation is accepted by Excel and how to incorporate this in the code, with interpolation in forecasts etc..Then I want to do a lot of numerical comparisons between Calc and Excel - where possible.Then I need to make a unit test; simple no-difference check with Excel is not possible as it is a forecast and the result depends on the exact method and sometimes random numbers.Then I want to go through the code again with a toothbrush.Then I want to prepare help-text (for someone else to put into the repository).And then my draft could become a real submission.We'll be in 2016 be then, it's a huge job - for me, at least ;)"

12983,0,Patch Set 1:(4 comments)Thanks so much! :-)  I've added few comments - can you please have a look?
12986,1,"Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1(4 comments)I've added a few comments, please see inline.But the biggest issue I have is with the design. We should avoid unnecessary complexity. When the user opens a password-protected document (without providing a password, or with wrong password) it will fail. Loading will fail. End of story.The UI should report the failure and prompt for password. Another load request should then be sent to the server, with the password, to try loading again.There is no need to have a password command, or remembering the jail url, or having a new callback (modify load callback to take the optional password) etc. All we need is for 'load' to have an optional password that is passed to the right API when provided.If 'load' fails, then everything fails and the user can try again. It's a fatal error to load a document and without a document there is no need to maintain anything at all (certainly no child). I'd even close the socket and cleanup everything. The UI should handle this case in a friendly fashion.Fail, return, prompt the user, and let them try again.Let's discuss if there are any design questions. Thanks!"
12987,1,"Patch Set 3:Ashod: Hmm, the design concern is actually a good point; unfortunately on the LibreOffice side, it asks for the password interactively, so the LOK API was (naturally) extended so that we can interactively answer.Having said that, on the loolwsd level, it can be done as you suggest - return from load with ""no password provided"" error, ask the user for the password, and re-try the load completely (now with the password remembered).  That is safer (the load is not blocked), but OTOH more expensive (2x starting the load).Maybe we can even change the LOK API this way; but not sure what is best :-(Michael S.: Any view on this, please?"
12988,0,"Patch Set 3:This should take care of the design concern mentioned above. In case of password protected documents, ToPrisoner is closed when no password is provided along with the 'load' command, but ToClient holds and keep listening for further 'load' requests. When another 'load' command comes (with or without a password), the flow goes all the way through broker finding appropriate child to host the new document URI.Additionally, this also prevents caching for password protected documents with the help newly introduced bunch of password related variables and successful document load acknowledgment to parent process.'statusindicatorfinish:' is now used as an acknowledgment of successful document load operation on server side, as well as client side. In case of password protected document, it will be sent only when correct password is provided (because it is triggered by LOK), hence preventing the client to send any additional messages unless document has been opened successfully by providing the correct password."

Also, LOK's setDocumentPassword function treats an empty string as a password attempt, and would get triggered again unless I pass a nullptr to it to abort the load operation, but of course that could easily be dealt with.If there are no empty strings passwords for documents, then yeah, we can change it to std::string, assuming """" to be no password provided"

It's probably better to have a bool to track if we have a password (i.e. the user has provided a password) rather than track a pointer (and free).

13287,0,Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2Looks good and is one of the two solutions that I proposed to kendy when I discovered a similar case in Calc.For other reasons (mainly for clarity) I think that it might still be a good idea to use independent test for tests that change the config but both solutions are technically correct.

13313,1,"Patch Set 1:> how could one remove such graphics?Well, that's an egg-or-chicken question.We should now answer it here. The problem is: the standard doesn't impose this restriction, and so documents with such graphics are legitimate. Moreover, they actually exist. Failing to import them is not a good option. There may be restriction at the UI level that doesn't allow e.g. creating those, and a UI may be developed to handle them if needed (e.g., like in AutoCAD that includes a tool to whipe zero-sized objects, or a navigator update that would include graphics list, including zero-sized). But that's a different task.Also, silently dropping those objects isn't good, too, because that would impair round-trip of documents."

That will most likely hurt us later but well we can deal with it then.I had chats with Kohei and Eike and I think the solution that seems to be acceptable to all of us is to use a std::vector<ScColumn*> or std::vector<std::unique_ptr<ScColumn>> with the additional requirement that there are no nullptr entries.This provides us with some benefits compared to the version without the additional requirement and the version based on std::vector<ScColumn>. We don't need to check every entry while iterating through columns (just compare once against std::vector::size) and we don't need to worry that pointers to ScColumn instances become invalid when we insert or remove a column. I hope this helps you for the rest of the work.

Bad bad bad bad :) One of the ways out is to disable Add button when nothing's selectedThe list of effects lost its context sensitivity e.g. when a text object is selected, font effects (in emphasis section, like change font, enlarge font etc.) are no longer offered.The controls somehow update incorrectly, e.g. Emphasis category, click Change fill colour -> nothing happens.

We cannot use a flag to keep track of the last entry because it could have been typed in, so there won't be a trigger for the flag.   The current solution does not cover all situations (for example, if the last letter is a space character), but I think it would cover the most common use cases, without having to invoke formula engine  with every change.If you think the formula is getting parsed with each change already, or if you think it won't be much of an overhead, then if you could give me some pointers, I could use that in the solution.Thanks"

Then only add the new commit to the push tree (which already contains the pushed commit) and push to gerrit for review.Gerrit complained that you tried to push a patch that has been merged already to gerrit review.

That is, everything else evaluated to single-line, so the sequence was reasonable (that's my understanding).At any rate, I think we need to review these assumptions. For example the code now expects 3 cases: nextmessage, single-line, and a 3rd undocumented case.Please add the const (see note) and I'll submit this patch, then we need to review the protocol(.txt) and the code and make sure we have a solid situation.

14403,1,"Patch Set 2:When cleaning up this, especially now with people from multiple companies working on LibreOfficeKit, it would be important to make the HAS macros actually work in the presence of all the UNSTABLE stuff.As discussed on IRC with vmiklos, currently it doesn't work as perhaps intended. In a LibreOffice instance, the UNSTABLE parts are compiled in, and thus the nSize member of the structs are initialised to include the size of the pointers to the unstable methods.So if we have a LibreOffice instance from before the addition of freeError (or other methods that will be added in the near future), and a client compiled against a bleeding-edge header (with the freeError present), the client will think that the freeError is present in the struct that the LibreOffice instance presents to it, even if it isn't, because the nSize is large enough to cover where freeError would be, even if what actually is in that location in the LibreOffice instance is some unstable function pointer.This will bite us hard at some point in the future unless we fix it soon. My initial suggestion, off-hand, is to move all the unstable function pointers into separate structs, and have a single pointer to such a struct as part of the *stable* API."

14494,1,"Patch Set 3:LO uses 90px/in (=90px/72pt) in its own export to svg (at least on my PC, what do you get?). So where a conversion is needed on import, it should use the same setting.I have no strong opinion about how many px should be used for font-size=""medium"". This value alone says nothing about the rendered size. The unit px is equal to the 'user unit' at the place where px it currently used. Therefore the real size depends highly on viewBox and transformations.Other application have no unique value. Browser base the font-size=""medium"" to the user's default font size. Google Chrom and Seamonkey seem to use ""medium""=16px as predefined value, Internet Explorer 18px, Batik seems to use 12px, and Corel Draw uses a value between 10px and 11px.For the table of scaling values for the other absolute-size keywords, I would stick to factor 1.2, as it is recommended in the first edition of CSS2, because factor 1.5 was noticed as bad. All the other things mentioned in the later specification of CSS2 (e.g. resolution of the device, quality and availability of fonts, no fixed ratio, avoiding <9px) are not necessary in a first implementation. I suggest, to improve the mapping in case of user complains."

It's not about the presentation but about the landscape flag because the presentation only depends on paperw and paperh.You are right, I should'nt reset landscape flag in \sect but in the RTF spec, landscape define a default value for the flag like paperw or paperh and I don't find a command to set portrait orientation in this default value.I found an interesting information in the RTF spec:\lndscpsxn: Page orientation is in landscape format. To mix portrait and landscape sections within a document, the \landscape control should not be used so that the default for a section is portrait, which may be overridden by the \lndscpsxn control.So, I think my files are incorrectly formatted:\sect \paperw16837 \paperh11905 \landscape \sectdThe file should use pgwsxn, pghsxn and lndscpsxn instead of paperw, paperh and landscape and sectd should be before paperw.----I will update my patch :- remove reset section in sectd- implement lndscpsxn to set the current value- let landscape to set the current and default value- edit commit messageAre you agree with that ?"

Upload some real samples that generated by other software, Word for example, and describe the expected and observed result.

It's basic functionality to convert SVG XML to ODF XML is a good basic functionality, the only reasons to 'park' it now and not to invest more work is that SVGIO is capable of more features, that the XML conversion is limited in getting perfect due to ODF restrictions and that it is too much work to develop both.

15675,1,"Patch Set 1:My concern is:the point of TabsRelativeToIndent setting is to differentiate between two clearly distinct modes:1. When tabs are relative to this paragraph' start (e.g. 5 cm from paragraph left margin in LTR);2. When tabs are relative to page margin (e.g. 5 cm from page left)They are really different: in first, changing paragraph origin (e.g. moving table cell border, or wrapping from one column to another) moves the coresponding tab stops, while in second, the tab stop positions should stay positioned to absolute values on page, regardless the paragraph origin shift.But it's clearly not the case in current implementation, and was never so from the very beginning. Also, the bug existed from the start, too. So, I think I'd rather let the current way of operation and fix only the ruler bug, instead of forcing the (likely) intended logic with the risk of many existing documents' broken layout. Essentially, now this variable does not alter the tab placement logic, and affects only their saving to file/loading from file."
15676,1,Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1I seem to be missing the point of removing the non-relative-to-indent tab stop handling within the ruler.Writer (unfortunately) was initially designed in a way that tab stops are calculated from the left paragraph indent.To be compatible to doc/docx a non-relative usage of tab stops has been added which is (again unfortunately) only used for doc/docx import. If you remove that code the ruler will show wrong tab stops in docx/doc import.
15677,1,"Patch Set 1:> I seem to be missing the point of removing the non-relative-to-indent > tab stop handling within the ruler.Please take a look at tdf#95846, which itself is based on tdf#76005 (linked there as See Also...).

You may notice in the tdf issue, that I discuss the bug manifestation vector to be exactly that: importing docx. Actually, you confirm that the flag is used on import only, and then the tabs are stored in memory in usual LO way (relative to left paragraph indent). From there, they are fed into the ruler code (being usual relative-to-indent), so why does it need to treat them differently in this case?"

You will notice that in this situation the tabs in the ruler and the document don't match anymore.The problem of tdf#95846 might be that the column offset of the table calculated into the left indent."

15767,0,Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1The naming is ~irrelevant to me; but it should be consistent between 5-1 to master and then locked down IMHO.JanI - we want to see how many threads there are that can run concurrently to start implementing code that best exploits the parallelism out there. The exact processor geometry etc. is too much potentially identifying information IMHO.As such the naming is pretty ~irrelevant IMHO; best not to quibble.
15768,0,"Patch Set 1: -Code-Review> As such the naming is pretty ~irrelevant IMHO; best not to quibble.Happen to disagree. ""CPU threads"" is for me very different from ""threads"", but of course might be because I am too deep into how the CPU works.Will not block this, but neither promote it."
15769,1,"Patch Set 1:This seems a ridiculous discussion to me ;-) doer decides is a vital meritocratic principle =) quibbling adds little value it seems to me.Beyond that - there is nothing simple about APU hardware; we have both GPU and CPU compute resources with things akin to threads in them. Cores is also an horribly misleading term in a SMT world. There are even pending law-suits around ""what is a core"" - how many resources can be shared etc. There is no ""obvious"" answer to this question.What we are returning is: the result of std::thread::hardware_concurrency() - we can provide a hyper-descriptive label for this: but then we'll be sending a truck-load of these across the net for years, and there is only so much space in Help->About =)What is in the patch has the merit of brevity; if someone wants to change it to CPU Threads Hardware Concurency - to follow STL or whatever, they are welcome to - preferably in a separate, follow-up patch - that also line-wraps this for Help->About."

15822,1,"Patch Set 1:The same. The filter you work on gets an SVG, interprets it and creates a Draw document and shapes in it. What you need to do is get an SVG, do not interpret it, create a Draw document with a single GraphicObject on the 1st page which uses the SVG as Graphic. Should be all in there, just need to strip all the unnecessary stuff. It should be okay to experiment in the filter, finishing it would need stripping and cleanup. HTH!"
15824,1,"Patch Set 1:Upps, I got you wrong - It is not the same in the aoo project - in aoo there is no SVG filter in filter, but it opens SVGs at file/open as intended.

This new dropdown will include Save Remote File, as well as other proposed items like saving to different formats etc."

It doesn't affect the menu in any way.BTW, I forgot to mention that the behavior of this button is now configurable through ""expert config"". Any user is free to revert it to the state before this patch, or even to drop the dropdown completely:Type ""SaveToolbarController"" in the search field and hit Enter.To revert to the previous state, change ""Controller"" to ""com.sun.star.comp.framework.GenericPopupToolbarController"", and ""Value"" to "".uno:SaveAsMenu"". Leaving ""Value"" empty will bring back the old simple button."

There will always be situations where the user does not expectthe result, for example if a row of cells has a thick bottom border asfor header cells, and cells of the table below have thin borders.Removing the thin borders should not remove the adjacent thick border aswell.Though Excel has this behavior, because there adjacent cells share theborder and removing it from one cell removes it also from the adjacentcell.The best would be to offer a checkbox ""Remove border from adjacent cellsas well"" or some such, to be activated only if borders are to beremoved, and only if checked remove borders from envelope cells.Maybe a second correct attempt, if we don't want another checkbox, couldbe to remove an adjacent border only if it has the same attributes(color, width, style), but that would mean having to compare allenvelope cells with their selected neighbour instead of doing it in onego. > I tested in 5.0.

I made sure this patch was purely defensive and doesn't include any breaking changes, so nothing in this patch requires this.However, changing the order of includes, or adding certain files in pch, breaks a lot of files (this patch and a handful others that I've submitted hardened our code and fix those issues). The breaking of files has a domino effect, so they are rather hard to find and fix (and consume an inordinate amount of time to track the source and figure out a workaround). My attempt was to make the minimum change to fix macro leaks and other conflicts across headers and files. This patch is for Windows related issues only.RGB happens to be defined by wingdi.h and leaks from multiple places. This was the easiest/simplest fix; to undef it where it conflicts. For other cases it was enough to undef them in postwin.h and make sure it's called after including windows headers."

The current fix allows workdir/CustomTarget/officecfg/registry/officecfg/Office/Common.hxx to be included, but if a source file happens to first include that officecfg/Office/Common.hxx, then include wingdi.h, and later wants to acutally use the struct RGB from Common.hxx, it still runs into a problem."

I tried that. And can give it another try. But it would require a much bigger change, obviously. The main problem is that wingdi.h is actually included from other windows headers too. So we can't fully control when it's included. But can give it another shot and narrow it down further. In fact, I spent hours trying to find what file includes the conflicting values to create this patch. > The current fix allows workdir/CustomTarget/officecfg/registry/officecfg/Office/Common.hxx > to be included, but if a source file happens to first include that > officecfg/Office/Common.hxx, then include wingdi.h, and later wants > to acutally use the struct RGB from Common.hxx, it still runs into > a problem.Well, that would be be a problem _only_ if wingdi.h was already included _before_ Office/Common.h, and in that case the build would fail because the macro would conflict with the declaration of RGB (my patch avoids this situation).However, if wingdi.h was _not_ included at the point of #undef RGB, then nothing bad would happen if it is included afterwards. Unless I missed something, I don't see how there would still be a problem, as wingdi.h will define RGB without issue.I should add that I hated this particular line of my patch. I share your view that it's best avoided altogether. But I couldn't find a better solution. Will try again though."

But my change will neither help nor harm that case :)(I only fixed the reverse, which is that wingdi.h is included before Common.hxx.)And I believe that case doesn't exist now (if they existed, I fixed them).Containing windows headers in postwin.h will help (which I fully support). But even then, once a header that includes wingdi.h (directly or indirectly) is included in the pch, then we still face the same issue. So it's really tricky.Since I was working on pch files, it was this latter case that really made things complicated. The way to avoid that is to never include an uncontained header that leaks in the pch, which is what we do. So the only case that breaks the build is when RGB is defined before Office/Common.hxx, which I patched.Actually, I think what we should do is add #undef RGB to postwin.h (even when currently it's not needed). I think that's the right thing to do and guarantee that wingdi.h is as contained as possible at all times."

Ironically, I don't think they are important for Base itself, but more for the services that Base provides to other components: namely the capacity for Writer to do mail merges on Outlook, Outlook Express, Thunderbird and LDAP address books (on Windows 32 bit).Oh the other hand, I understand and see that this whole old precompiled binary mozilla thing is a monstrosity that cannot continue indefinitely, in addition of being against our FLOSS principles. The timing of this instigates doubt that one of the reasons is to level down the Win32 and Win64 versions to the same feature set.As to ""could be rewritten from scratch"", yes, it could; the absence of activity on bugs 56903 56905 and 57322 suggests that we don't have the volunteer manpower to do that. Maybe leaving the glaring difference between the Win32 and Win64 builds would have brought some energy, who knows.Why do two files in connectivity/source/drivers/mozab/bootstrap survive?"

The Rectangle is *not* the place to keep such information. It's place is at the model (the SdrObject). See ::TRGetBaseGeometry implementations where the mirroring is coming from - e.g in SdrObjCustomShape it *is* a model member (X and Y).Currently - except for the SdrObjCustomShape and SdrGrafObj - the mirrored states are not preserved - the mirroring is geometrically *executed* on the existing geometry, that's it (aw080 changes this).You can see this sad truth e.g. at the graphic object - insert one in Draw/Impress and add text. Hor mirror does not change the text at all, vertical mirror uses a 180 deg rotation, *not* a true vert mirroring.This only does not come to more attention due to the fact that nearly all shapes are CustomShapes nowadays...Do not forget: mirror in X and Y equals a 180 deg rotation (can be seen/proved looking at the corrresponding homogen matrix)"

When changing the state, the layout is invalidated and the the default logic of repaginating and page-layout does its thing on next idle timer event. So changing this behavior will affect others as well.

17856,0,"Patch Set 3:Thank you for your review.I think that DECODE_WITH_CHARSET is better than DECODE_TO_IURI.If the file name is ""foo%2Fbar"", the return value of getUnpackedValueOrDefault() will probably be ""foo%252Fbar"".Because the return value is url-encoded(percent-encoded).If we use DECODE_TO_IURI, decoded result will be ""foo%252Fbar"".If we use DECODE_WITH_CHARSET, decoded result will be ""foo%2Fbar""."
17857,1,"Patch Set 3:""If we use DECODE_TO_IURI, decoded result will be 'foo%252Fbar'.""  No.Also, looking more closely at the code in MediaDescriptor::requestAndVerifyDocPassword, disregarding the unfortunate variable name ""aDocumentName"" and the equally unfortunate naming of corresponding css.task.Document[MS]PasswordRequest members as ""Name"" (""the name of the document,"" ts ts), what is apparently intended is to pass the document's URI (cf. PasswordDialog ctor in uui/source/passworddlg.cxx, where the corresponding value is more properly named ""aDocURL"").  So it is probably better to mark-up the URI in a more ""user friendly"" way directly in that PasswordDialog ctor instead.Also, given that tdf#89694's example involves a filename also containing a space, an even more ""user friendly"" way might be to use DECODE_UNAMBIGUOUS instead of DECODE_TO_IURI even (which would display the space as "" "" instead of as ""%20"").  Note that there is no single ""right"" answer whether to use NO_DECODE, DECODE_TO_IURI, or DECODE_UNAMBIGUOUS here.  Each produces a string that could unambiguously be converted back into a true URI, just with varying degrees of ""user friendliness"" of the produced string.  On the other hand, DECODE_WITH_CHARSET produces a string that in general cannot unambiguously be converted back into a true URI, so loses information and potentially presents a misleading result to the user."
17858,1,"Patch Set 3:(1 comment)Thank you for your advice.I also think that the variable name ""aDocumentName"" is very misleading.1. About the insert point to decode URL.As you wrote, I think that the best way to convert is in PasswordDialog ctor.However, to reduce the influence I now was according to the method for the other formats(odf,etc...).For the other formats, probably insert points to decode URL are just before calling the UNO API, Document(MS)PasswordRequest(2). (e.g.   http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sfx2/source/appl/appopen.cxx#245  http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sw/source/filter/ww8/ww8par.cxx#5468)Somehow, those APIs want ""the name of the document""... Therefore, in the case of OOXML, I think that the insert point to decode URL is either within MediaDescriptor::requestAndVerifyDocPassword() in unotools or DocPasswordHelper::requestAndVerifyDocPassword() in comphelper.Because the latter point has a smaller effect, I will modify the patch.(I think in the comphelper, INetURLObject can not be used because of the module dependencies. So, I will call directly rtl::url::decode().)2. About decodeMechanism for converting URL.I tried the two ways of rtl_UriDecodeWithCharset and rtl_UriDecodeToIuriRI, I have attached screen shots to bug report tdf#89694.https://bug-attachments.documentfoundation.org/attachment.cgi?id=113966https://bug-attachments.documentfoundation.org/attachment.cgi?id=113967I used this patch.https://bug-attachments.documentfoundation.org/attachment.cgi?id=113965I think the case in rtl_UriDecodeWithCharset is more user-friendly.If I mistake,  please point out."

17860,1,"Patch Set 3:Re ""1. About the insert point to decode URL."":  Those other places are misguided in passing a marked-up ""document name"" instead of a URI.  The only reasonable design is to centrally mark-up the URI in the PasswordDialog ctor in uui/source/passworddlg.cxx, where it is presented to the user.  The PasswordDialog ctor gets it right in calling it ""aDocURL,"" all the other places unfortunately get it wrong in vaguely calling it a ""document name.""Re ""2.

It is these ""outside events"" that are affecting the selection.2.)  I can't even guess at the circumstance that requires the popping of a cursor to cancel a selection.  Why is that code even in wrtsh1?  It seems to have been there since day1 and I have no idea how to identify whether it would be safe to remove it now.3.)

18180,0,"Patch Set 2:I don't think that the document will be rendered differently once LibreOffice saves it. I agree that this fix is not ideal, but it would take a lot more effort to solve it correctly.All the labels are treated as strings, not as numbers.  So we could do that we apply the number format on import, and still keep the result (like ""Oct-12"") as string, which would make them displaying nicely. The drawback is the export / roundtrip, as then the string with the applied number format would get saved.  But I believe will make the situation for export (roundtrip) not much worse than currently, because we are exporting the labels as strings anyway, not as numbers, so now after roundtrip, the user sees 41183 instead of Oct-12 anyway."
18181,1,Patch Set 2:How will this not result in different rendering once LibreOffice saves the document. All the code that is behind the *MSO* flags in the chart2/source/view/* code will only be hit for documents that have been saved by MSO.None of these code paths will be hit if the same document has been saved by LibreOffice.Additionally I consider the idea to put such code into the chart2/source/view/* the worst idea since the decision to use UNO inside chart2/*. The chart2/source/view code should never ever contain checks for the file format and even less for the producer of the file.At least I would never accept such code inside of chart2.

So USING_X11!=TRUE turns out to be equivalent to with_x==no. Unless I miss something;)In theory one could also imagine building a LibreOffice for Windows or OS X that would not use any display-oriented APIs, but that would be fairly pointless, as that functionality is always present in the OS anyway. It isn't like Linux, where some people think it is useful to have installations without any X11 stuff."

When there is breakage, I add #if blocks using the upcoming __clang_major/minor__ versions, but it may be the case that sometimes these breaking changes will not actually appear in that (then upcoming) version, but will only remain on trunk (towards the next version).

18985,1,Patch Set 4:How big is the chance that this incompatible (IIUC) change breaks external code (and breaks compatibility with AOO for external code)?  Do any benefits of this change outweigh those drawbacks?

19023,0,"Patch Set 1: Verified-1Looks good. However, two things:- When selecting a whole cell, the conversion doesn't work- Can you please add some sensible text to the undo stack?"
19024,1,"Patch Set 1:Undo:  I don't see any example code in calc that sets an undo message, and from what I DO see the text is a hard-coded response based on the type of 'edit'.  If I just type regular text, I also only get ""input"" (from InsertText() call) with no extra detail.  So what I have works identically to regular changes, and I don't see ANY ability to set an undo comment. cell editing:  This would need to be done in a totally different section.  In the editsh EXECUTE(), the Alt-X keystroke isn't even being captured when the cell is only selected.  So, effectively Calc is not in edit mode yet, and thus Alt-X doesn't apply.  If the ""cursor"" is either in the cell itself OR in the top editview, then the alt-x function works.  I would expect people to be editing the text when they use Alt-X, not finding an entire cell of data and trying to convert the whole thing.  So I don't think it is necessary to duplicate all of this code to handle that situation."
19025,1,"Patch Set 1:Possible usecase for cell-level Alt-X support: building a table demonstrating unicode characters.  Select a row of cells, Alt-X and convert all to unicode character (or vice versa).  I'll look into what that will take.  It would be a separate patch."

(When all file picker implementations do implement XFilePicker2, client code can still make use of it---via explicit queryInterface---even without XFilePicker3 being derived from it.)"

(Which is one reason why I would still first get all file picker implementations support XFilePicker2 before taking care of this ""convenience improvement"" change.)"

Someone else has to do that.If this fix is otherwise acceptable, I'd push it even without handling the corner case. It stops the bleeding and helps the users. Full stop."

The tests I wrote were counting the number of times the timers trigger in a multi-timer scenario. What I had discovered is that there is a lack of consistency, which I have plans to fix/address.For example, when two timers have the same timeout and priority, one could get a very low trigger rate (or none at all). This is because the trigger logic always picks the one with highest priority that is next in line, and so can end up picking the same timer to trigger every time, starving the other(s).I have a patch to address this and also to fix make IdleTimer fire only when the process idles. >  > But I didn't read the unit test code too carefully - thanks so much > for re-basing the cleanups =) lets submit as/when CI builds it > cleanly if it can.The reason I had disabled the fail condition when the new tests were excluded is because the remaining code is useful in detecting timers that don't trigger during the watchdog timeout. That is, timers should eventually trigger, even if they don't trigger with any accuracy. So I was effectively disabling the accuracy test, but the timers should've triggered during the dozen seconds that the watchdog ways (which you've increased). The test not passing reliably was because of the strictness of the precision tests, not the fact that timers weren't triggering (which would be a real bug). The precision tests are only meaningful if they come with some delta, and I had used 10-20%, increasing it would mean more passing runs, but less useful precision tests. Let's keep them disabled for now.Thanks again for the reviews and helping with this. And please expect more patches on timers."

As I said, I didn't try to replicate MSO exactly or the bug report, just a first hack at the request to reduce/hide whitespace. And, IMHO, I don't see why we should clone the feature as-is from MSO (or any other) instead of deciding what would be best in terms of usability for our users (myself being a heavy user of Writer).I don't have a preference except to make the feature as useful as possible. In that respect, left/right margins can be reduced in book- and multi-page views (and could be left as-is in the single-page view).I would really like to get UI designer and user feedback here, as this is a usability feature, not a technical one per-se."

19390,0,"Patch Set 6:I checked MSO and i was mistaken with my assumptions, all is fine except that the left and right margins should be left as is.

It seems that removing the header and footer also causes content to jump to the previous page, as the page isnt being cropped but instead the content is allowed to flow within the full size of the page space.In case i didnt mention it before, i am part of the design and UX teams. :D"

I mentioned this somewhere as a limitation. The reason for this is that the page size is the same, but the margins are removed/reduced. So the text is allowed to fill in more surface area. This could be solved by changing the page dimensions in hide-whitespace mode. I didn't try to do that, again, to get initial feedback. > In case i didnt mention it before, i am part of the design and UX > teams. :DFantastic! Thanks again."

Good to know. The reason I wrote this script is because I have another patch that improves pch generation (a rewrite of update_pch in python that updates every single pch in the codebase in a few seconds). It was obvious to me that to improve the pch generation to make builds faster I had to deal with the problem of conflicting headers (that are excluded from pch) and required headers (that will break the build if left out). This script solves the latter problem, so now what is included in pch headers is purely to accelerate builds, not to prevent the build from breaking.Will submit the update_pch script and updated pch files sometime soon, as time permits."

I only submitted when I was confident enough that they won't cause immediate instability (evident from the commit message and the test design/code). What I'm saying in the message is that there are no strong guarantees from the OS, and the tests _can_ fail (doesn't mean _will_ fail). I just don't know how often. I suspect they will not fail any more than other fragile tests fail, and far less often than jenkins fails randomly (I know because I tested extensively).I think we should disable only when there is evidence that it is not stable.I will replace the static buffer with dynamic one."

The empty control region gets mirrored for rtl from left(0), top(0), empty, empty to right(number), top(0), empty, empty and so the cairo_translate call is given a non-0 number and it all falls apart.Lets try not mirroring the empty rectangle arg, and take the first hunk of this patch which is clearly ok and then the second isn't needed.Hopefully this doesn't break any other native-rendering platforms, looks ok for gtk2 and gtk3 for me at least"

I think all that is required is to adjust http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/basic/source/classes/sbxmod.cxx#1809 (or get rid of that method and adjust the caller (in scriptcont) to pass the current binary format versionplease see https://bz.apache.org/ooo/show_bug.cgi?id=64377needless to say that stuff needs to be retested too (but it would be good to get it in)It is of course possible to juggle the version numbers (and code) in such away to implement just this new update to the binary format (and skip enabling aoo#64377) that's fine too, but... I think a version bump in necessary in anycase"

20059,1,Patch Set 5:Hi Ashod - is it -really- the case that our periodic timers don't work  =) I'd be really worried if that was so - we need a unit test for it. Any chance you can create one ?Thanks !
20060,1,"Patch Set 5:> Hi Ashod - is it -really- the case that our periodic timers don't > work  =) I'd be really worried if that was so - we need a unit test > for it. Any chance you can create one ? > Thanks !Depends what you mean by ""work."" The timers of course _do_ work, but that is not the problem I'm fixing. I'm fixing the issue with high idle CPU utilization. Periodic timers should reset their start time so that they re-fire only after the duration has expired. The issue, I found, is that Timer thinks it's ready to fire again at the next tick. Ticks come in for the _soonest_ next timer delay (this is because we really have only one system timer callback, and we need it to fire for the next timer in the queue). In the worst case they come in immediately (after 1ms) and in those cases Timer thinks it's ready to fire again, which it does. This doesn't cause any obvious problems, other than CPU utilization where there shouldn't be any (because Timer handles background jobs, like spellchecking, which wastes some CPU and returns, but the waste is proportional to the document size and number of documents open).It is clear from the code that nowhere is the start-time reset. Of course I had the luxury of debugging and seeing what was happening, but the code and my comments make it almost trivial to trace the variable in question and see that without changing it, it will trick Timer into firing again. (See Timer::ReadyForSchedule where mnUpdateTime is used.)I can add unittest for this but, from experience, timers are not reliable enough to trap them within a reasonable time frame from make the test meaningful. On a non-realtime OS, they come with no guarantees. And they are less consistent across a number of OSes. We can have a crude ""test fire once"" and ""test don't fire too soon"" but it's harder to have ""fired too late."" Also, it's much harder to simulate the myriads of jobs we have and the arbitrary periods of each (and how they overlap).I'll give it a shot, but applying and running a large document with this 1 liner will show that the idle CPU utilization does go to 0."

20785,1,Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1Hi Daniel - nice patch; a few comments though - I was expecting this to be a 2x liner but ... ;-) lets see.The primary problem I think is that you replaced the HPBYTE typedef with Scanline instead of sal_uInt8 * =) which is what it should be replaced with. So - I think we need to undo that everywhere.The twain header re-defines HPBYTE for its own internal use - we shouldn't touch that I think; please drop that piece.Otherwise I think you've got it =)If you re-push a tweaked version with s/Scanline/sal_uInt8*/ in your changes - and git commit --amend locally - ie. keeping the same change-id and re-push; then it should update this commit & re-trigger a CI build.Thanks muchly :-)

Also in ScFormulaCfg::ImplCommit() CONV_A1_XL_A1 is not handled.In sc/source/filter/oox/workbookhelper.cxx in WorkbookGlobals::initialize() has aCalcConfig.meStringRefAddressSyntax = getConvention(xDocProps); where getConvention() returns CONV_OOO if the generator was not Microsoft.

If what the UNO object points to changes somehow, in content or by a (more) remote bridge doing something odd, that's still irrelevant - this is exactly comparable to the hashing behaviour of ordinary user created Python objects: by default, __hash__ is id(object) (... which is really its memory address), and an object is equal exactly and only to itselfMore specifically, the requirements are:- The hash value must not change over the lifetime of the object (true, the address of the wrapped UNO object can't change, and the same wrapped object is reused even if pulled across the bridge several times)- Hashable objects which compare equal must have the same hash value (true, PyUNO objects only compare equal if they have the same wrapped object)"
21008,1,Patch Set 1:hmm... rtlRandomPool definitely needs to use some real entropy instead of the ridiculous __rtl_random_initPool()but i'm not sure if reading from /dev/urandom in __rtl_random_initPool is a good idea - how much do we read from there? where is this rtlRandomPool used? will that drain the kernel's entropy pool (so that other process reading /dev/random block)? would it be better to only initialize the pool from /dev/urandom and then use the old MD5 based generator from there?

21175,1,"Patch Set 1:The first problem is that it returnsRectangle(aRect.x, aRect.y, aRect.width, aRect.height)when Rectangle takes right and botton not width and height for its two last args so this is the wrong Rectangle anyway except for the monitor 0 case where its close enough.The other problem is that these tooltips are positioned by ImplSetHelpWindowPos in vcl/source/app/help.cxx taking into account the Rectangle returned by GetDesktopRectPixel to ensure the tooltip is put inside the DesktopRectangle. That just calls this directly. In this GetDesktopRectPixel the help window hasn't been positioned yet, so it is still on monitor 0, so you always get monitor 0 dimensions not 1. One could query the parent window here, which would also make it work a lot of the time when the tooltip should be displayed on the monitor that most of the parent is on, but that'll fail in the case that you display a tooltip on a minority part of a window that's over two monitors.But anyway I guess the bottom line is that this method is apparently expected to return the usable rectangle of the overall desktop rather than of the individual monitor the window is on"

In this situation, no tip is given.If, starting with =ABS(2), you start edit, remove B and S and type S, you do get the hint.I think this behaviour is fine, but of course I'm interested in your expert opinion."

The work was overlooked by the Board and representatives from the Marketing and Design teams.I am really sorry you do not like the design; pity that you did not contact me that you were interested :-( - eg. based on the Design or ESC meeting minutes, I would have added you to the people overlooking the work of course.

21494,1,Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2 Verified+1Likewise no point in gumming up the CI with this I think; too trivial.
21504,1,Patch Set 1:I think the code in ImplPaint isn't doing quite what I had put in my original patch. I'd put a fix in there for this exact issue - wrong text colour when highlighted. My original code was:            if ( pThisItemOnly )            {                if ( bIsMenuBar && bRollover )                    pWin->SetTextColor( rSettings.GetMenuBarRolloverTextColor() );                else if ( bIsMenuBar )                    pWin->SetTextColor( rSettings.GetMenuBarTextColor() );                else if ( bHighlighted )                    pWin->SetTextColor( rSettings.GetMenuHighlightTextColor() );            }which I don't think is what is implemented here.
21505,0,"Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2 Verified+1Alright, need to make use of menubar style for the hightlight/selected entries there and not take the menu style. Just uncovered an existing bug I guess. Bundled the fix for that in here and looks good for my gtk2 now."

21566,1,"Patch Set 2:Is the change to Apache License intended?Are you going to write more into odff.xhp? Otherwise it is a candidate for indexer=""exclude"", because it is confusing for an user, to get such content by full text search.The element 'filename' in source/text/scalc/01/func_timevalue.xhp has an absolute path in its value.

21628,1,Patch Set 1:(6 comments)I didn't realise that the fMem/bNull is there to reduce precision errors.Reintroducing fMem/bNull for the SUM function will probably reduce the bug reports on these errors; that's an extra stimulant for me to work on this.

The old code DID only handle increasing sequential links - just sometimes it ran across the bigger sequence first, and then reversed the logic to matched with the lower one.  It was MY example doc (albeit vml) that actually was numbered in the reverse order and so wouldn't have worked on the old logic. And your test document loaded/looked fine.  So in my mind I'm combining all that plus some things I saw (can't remember all where) about mso-layout-flow-alt indicating a reverse sequence - where the highest number starts the chain instead of ends the chain, but although this alt-flow is put in the grabbag, it is never used.  In the end the lack of reverse chaining is still a (potentially) missing feature, not a regression."

But that means if there *is* a \par at the end of the file, then we still need a newline. The bug claims that this is a regression, as it was OK in 3.3; and that's what 3.3 did.I'll check the writerfilter part, I can easily imagine that your changes are mostly OK, it's just that you mirrored the ODT import code, which always adds an empty paragraph at the end of the import result in case of pasting, and writerfilter has to do the same if we want the correct end result."

But that means if > there *is* a \par at the end of the file, then we still need a > newline.No. You may just check that LO does add \par at the end of any text copied to clipboard (its RTF part). Then, if You paste it to, say,MSWord or Write for Windows, You don't have newline.The same is true for RTF files. You may create a file with the samecontents that You used in unit test, and see that LO/OOo/AOO, and Write/MSWord doesn't add newline in the end. But if You add another\par (with just one space or CRLF) before last one, You'll havethat newline.While RTF spec does say about \par as special character, it isdeclared ""End of paragraph"", not ""newline"", as described in ""SpecialCharacters"".RTF spec is not quite consistent about it: ""Paragraph Test"" saysthat ""\par"" is ""New paragraph"". But the <textpar> says that \par must be followed by <para>, that includes at least one character.""Mathematics"" says similar: ""A math paragraph may be part of a text paragraph (text ending in a \par and either starting a document or following a \par)."" > The bug claims that this is a regression, as it was OK in > 3.3; and that's what 3.3 did.No; it was marked as ""Inherited from OOo"" in Oct 2013 > I'll check the writerfilter part, I can easily imagine that your > changes are mostly OK, it's just that you mirrored the ODT import > code, which always adds an empty paragraph at the end of the import > result in case of pasting, and writerfilter has to do the same if > we want the correct end result.Well, however you may change the copying to buffer part, you should not treat ending single \par as newline to be consistent with reference implementations; so the old unit test is still incorrect."
22989,1,"Patch Set 3:Hi,If that's OK for you, I will tweak writerfilter to emit different doc model for documents having a final \par or not, then merge your patch to properly remove the second fake node.If you would like to have RTF copy&paste not create a newline when the paste is from LO, I would rather tweak the RTF export to do that: so that what we export is in what e.g. Wordpad does.I think tweaking our import to work around what can be improved on the export side is suboptimal. :-)And yes, sorry about the mess, bug 90260 and 70318 is really similar, but only one is marked as a regression, I looked into fixing the regression one, you did the other -- I wish these linked somehow together before we started fixing them. ;-)Thanks,Miklos"

23341,0,Patch Set 4:@KoheiSounds good. But I am not sure how to convert the decompressed SvStream type back to io::XInputStream. I guess the sc code expects io::XInpuStream type when querying MediaDescriptor with MediaDescriptor::PROP_INPUTSTREAM(). Please advise.
23344,0,"Patch Set 4:That is interesting.  I would first look into SfxMedium::GetMedium_Impl() to see if we are indeed loading the input stream twice, or something else is going on...  That method is located in sfx2/source/doc/docfile.cxx at line 2228."
23346,0,"Patch Set 4:That's a surprise to me because I had assumed that SfxMedium would get instantiated from the MediaDescriptor object which contained the input stream, and it would re-use the already allocated input stream from the media descriptor.  Would you mind digging a bit into this to see what's going on there?Thanks for doing the investigation.  So far you've been doing great."
23347,1,"Patch Set 4:@Kohei : After textdetect filter call, in the call to SfxMedium::GetMedium_Impl()both pImp->xStream and pImp->xInputStream are populated. At line number 2340, in this method, pImp->m_pInstream is populated from pImp->xStream rather than pImp->xInputStream due to the order of if-else statements. I think that pImp->xStream is uncompressed as I did not set MediaDescriptor::PROP_STREAM property in media descriptor in the detect code.The csv import dialog uses the xInputStream directly where as the ScDocShell::ConvertFrom() uses SvStream from SfxMedium::GetInStream()I tried to reverse the order of if-else statement in SfxMedium::GetMedium_Impl() (starting at line number 2340). But soon realized that it is not correct as1) it breaks some unit tests (import of pdf files failed)2) Though the spreadsheet now shows uncompressed data, the csv import dialog shows empty data !. I thought it was due to file stream position set to the end, but seeking the pImp->xInputStream to the beginning did not solve that.So I reverted this change and instead tried assigning to both MediaDescriptor::PROP_STREAM and MediaDescriptor::PROP_INPUTSTREAM properties in the textdetect filter code as follows :uno::Reference<io::XStream> xStreamDecompressed(new utl::OStreamWrapper(*pDecompressedStream));                                                                                                    aMediaDesc[MediaDescriptor::PROP_STREAM()] <<= xStreamDecompressed;                                                                                                                                aMediaDesc[MediaDescriptor::PROP_INPUTSTREAM()] <<= xStreamDecompressed->getInputStream();This change seems to work, no unit test failed, and uncompressed data in both spreadsheet and csv import dialog. I will push this patch to gerrit shortly."
23348,0,"Patch Set 8: Code-Review-1The import part looks good, and functions very well.  Great job on doing your analysis and coming up with a very well thought-out solution.Now, the only remaining issue is the saving.  Right now, when you open a csv.gz file, edits it, and hits Ctrl-S, it saves it back to the file uncompressed, while the extension is intact.  This is not ideal.I can think of 2 ways to resolve this.  The first way is to support saving it back gz compressed, by somehow storing the information that this file has been uncompressed and using that information and trigger gz compression on saving.  In this scenario, you need to be careful not to compress on save when the user decides to save the file with a different name.  There would be other corner cases you'd have to handle when going this route. Personally I don't like this solution.The 2nd way is to load the file read only when the file is automatically uncompressed during file detection.  This way, when the user wants to edit it and re-save it, she won't be able to overwrite the original file.  I personally like this solution.Here is the gotcha, though.  Forcing a read-only load is as easy as setting the read only flag to true with the media descriptor, which will prompt you that the document has been opened read only, and to edit it, the user will need to click ""Edit document"" to create a new document instance.  When you do that, Calc will still load the compressed stream into the 2nd document instance, not the uncompressed version.  This needs to be addressed.I hope this will not be too much trouble to solve.  Good luck!"
23349,1,"Patch Set 8:@Kohei :1) While pursuing your second method, I found that the impl_detectTypeAndFilter() [1] is not getting called while clicking ""Edit Document"" button on the read-only document, hence the automatic decompression is skipped and it fills the spreadsheet with compressed raw data.[1] http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/framework/source/loadenv/loadenv.cxx#365Should I try to make it call impl_detectTypeAndFilter() by setting some flag in mediadescriptor during the readonly load phase in textdetect filter detect code ?But I feel that it is very inefficient to retry all filter detect code again.Unfortunately I could not find the place where X[Input]*Stream objects are recreatedduring the reload.2) Another thing I tried is instead of setting READONLY flag in text filter detect function, I set PROP_ASTEMPLATE in media descriptor to true, and then it loads a new untitled document with the uncompressed content. The issue here is that the document title is ""Untitled 1"" though the sheet name is intact.3) I also tried this : Without setting READONLY flag, I modified the PROP_URL property of media descriptor in text filter detect function within gzip detection block as : OUString aURL = aMediaDesc.getUnpackedValueOrDefault(MediaDescriptor::PROP_URL(), OUString() );                                                                                                    sal_Int32 nIdx = aURL.lastIndexOf("".gz"");                                                                                                                                                          if (nIdx != -1)                                                                                                                                                                                      aMediaDesc[MediaDescriptor::PROP_URL()] <<= aURL.replaceFirst("".gz"", """", &nIdx);Now Calc loads up the uncompressed data and when I modify the document and hit save, it saves to *.csv file rather than to *.csv.gz"
23350,0,"Patch Set 8:Great analysis!  I personally think that (assuming that it works) your approach 3) is the best approach under the circumstance.  Could you make the change for that and update your patch?  I'd like to give that a spin.One very minor thing I would change is to switch from replaceFirst() to copy() to get a substring of the original URL in order to remove the .gz extension.  Using replaceFirst is fine, but I personally find using the copy() method more ""natural"" for that sort of use given that you already have the position of the "".gz"" string.  You can use nIdx as the ""length"" of the new substring when using copy().Thanks a lot!"
23351,0,"Patch Set 9: Code-Review-1Thanks. It works quite well. Though I still think that loading it read-only and somehow getting the issue with clicking the 'Edit Document' resolved would be the best approach, getting that to work would probably involve re-using the already loaded input stream rather than loading the content from the file again, which may involve more work than we are willing to invest at the moment.I've found another minor issue though.  When the csv.gz file is set read only i.e. set chmod 0444 on the file, it still loads the compressed stream.  I wonder this is the issue similar to the earlier one we encountered?"
23354,0,"Patch Set 10:Yup, it works well. Thanks a lot for your patience!One minor issue, which I think we can ignore for now, is that when opening an read-only csv.gz file, it opens as non-read-only document.  I think ideally we should be loading such file as read-only just to be consistent with how it works with all the other format types, but we can just declare that as a known issue and handle it in the future (if we decide to).I'll push this change shortly."

I wanted to make all functions using GetSortArray() and GetNumberSequenceArray() to accept inline text arrays representing dates. I made attachments for both tdf89872 and tdf88547 containing a bit of both types of function calls.These attachments give the same result in Excel as in Calc (with this patch set).I have not tested Excel with inline text arrays like {""1"",""3"",""4""}; my patch will accept this.IMHO the sort of patch you suggest will keep a difference between Excel and Calc and therefor will lead to a bug report sooner or later.

We do use specific names for various parts of pivot tables, so I'd like for the new name to adhere to that convention.Last thing, we do need a unit test case for this new behavior to ensure that we won't accidentally break this in our future changes to the pivot table code."
24251,0,"Patch Set 6:I checked the run-time behavior and it works very well.  And I checked the ODF attribute name, and I *think* that, although there are several other names we could re-use for this purpose, repeat-item-labels is probably reasonable.Now, 2 things remain.  One is that we need a new unit test to cover this new feature.  Hopefully you can pick one of the existing test cases in ucalc_pivottable.cxx as a model and add a new test case.  Another one is that, because we are adding a new attribute that's not yet in the ODF standard, we need to use a different namespace other than 'table:', to make sure that when we export the document it will be a valid ODF.  I *think* you can use either XML_NP_CALC_EXT or XML_NP_LO_EXT for this.  Eike, do you have any advice on which namespace to use?That's all I have to say on this.  Great work!"

Our pivot UI is pretty limited, and I don't think we can accommodate that option without some UI redesign.  Also, having a toggle-all option would also mean a bit more work to synchronize it with the individual field settings.But if you feel strongly about having that option there, then I won't be dead set against it."
24254,1,Patch Set 7: Code-Review+2 Verified+1Looks quite good to me.  Sorry for the delay in reviewing your follow-up work.
24256,0,"Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1This patch still has issues.1) The new option shouldn't be added to the popup window since it's not an action but it's an attribute. The popup window is the wrong place to house this option.  It should go to the Field options dialog which can be reached from the layout dialog by double-clicking on the field name (which is kinda hidden, I know).  Once that dialog is open, you still need to click on the Options button to get to the actual dialog where you need to add this option.2) This should be a field (or dimension as it's called in the code) option. As such, it should be stored in ScDPSaveDimension as a new boolean member, not in ScDPSaveData, which should only store table-wide options.3) ODF export code should also reflect that, and store the new setting as a dimension attribute.  Right now you are saving it as a table attribute, which is wrong.  I didn't check your change in the import code, but I'd guess it has a similar issue.I did check Excel once again. Excel doesn't offer this as a table wide option. Only a field setting option.  What you saw is probably the print option where the user can choose to repeat field names when printing. But that's an entirely different setting."
24264,0,"Patch Set 1:This change has one side effect when searching in selections, I'm not yet sure whether that is a positive or negative change, but I lean towards negative ;-)The anchors ^ and $ now anchor at the selection boundary because the only text the regex matcher gets passed is the selected text. This in two paragraphs aaa bbb aaa bbb aaa bbb aaa bbbwhen the selection spans from the second aaa to the third bbb, for ^aaa finds the second aaa, where previously it found the third aaa at the real paragraph start.This may not be expected by the user, because the behavior of ^ is described as ""Match at the beginning of a line"" (or paragraph in our case), which the previous implementation did.On the other hand one may argue that the selection is the only text considered and thus logically starts a line.I'm undecided."

24315,1,"Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1The patch looks completely reasonable from the POV of the current state of the code. However, code archaeology suggests that merge commit 67d2af6fac2d9bad52a6b1f6e0cbd1229eb88a42 erroneously removed the call to ""ImplUpdate"" in MoveItem, since that line is present in BOTH parents of that merge. The ""if ( nNewPos < nPos )"" seems to be done for the sake of the ImplUpdate, to set the argument it will be called with. It looks reasonable, since the call is made with the default value of bDirect==false, then ImplUpdate updates *all* columns after its first argument (its argument inclusive). So it is essentially called with ::std::min(nPos, nNewPos).So it seems to me that we should rather fix the error in bd24a310be1459510b760b812838cb87923853c5 of using ""nPos"" instead of ""nNewPos"" in the second call of ::std::advance (the one before insert), but leave the ""if ( nNewPos < nPos )"" and reinsert the ""ImplUpdate(nPos, ...)"".Kendy, I know it is far away, but would you agree with my analysis of your merge commit?Julien, could you try out my suggestion above and test its effects, if the behaviour is good, the bug is still fixed, no other obvious bug is introduced, etc?

24403,0,"Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1The basic idea is a good one here. Clearly the ScHorizontalAttrIter is used in a ton of places across the code-base, particularly in filters, and making it ~instant for all the common big-data cases is very helpful.The basic approach looks good too - the nMinNextEnd looks sensible to detect large runs of identical formatting.What doesn't convince me that much is the initialization and management of the pPrevColEnd array. It looks like that is not initialized initially [sic] ;-) and then there is an assumption that:                if ( bRepeatedRow )                    nCol = pPrevColEnd[nCol];-but- (AFAICS) there is no guarentee that pPrevColEnd[nCol] is setup correctly - it rather depends on the value of nCol that was used last time - which (in turn) depends on the shape of the data.So - I would suggest adopting a different approach for generating and managing that - along with some nicer data structure for this case. IIWY I'd detect the case where there is a large run of identical styles - and in that case do more work to analyze them into a complete structure - that can be re-used for several subsequent rows; eg. if there are > 2x rows with the same thing - then allocate & fill that structure in (eg.).Is that do-able ? hopefully it'll make the code flow more pleasant too =)I'd also like to see a unit test created for the case that looks like it should fail in the above =) where we have constant patterns down a run - but a random layout of cell content.Thanks !"

24648,1,"Patch Set 1:Yes, it's possible to have an .uno:Something command, and no lc_something.png icon - in that case, only a text is presented.If the icon is or is not in the Galaxy theme is not the definitive answer for the question whether it is active or not - the Galaxy theme is not somehow more exclusive than the others any more.The best is to check the resulting images_*.zip - if the icon (like lc_blah.png) is in eg. in images_human.zip, icon-themes/human/cmd/lc_blah.png should not be removed.In other words, there is another system that takes care of bundling just the existing icons, but I am not sure if it is easy to get the list of the ""active"" icons in any way :-("

24907,1,"Patch Set 1:Caolan: thought you might be interested in this patch since it's vcl.I think it should be ok since http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/erase/ indicates that even in C++98 erase method of vector returns an iterator.However, I wonder if this patch might have wrong side effects since it concerns vcl and not relationships part only."
24908,1,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1Calling maItemList.erase(it) indeed invalidates it, we are not authorised to use it any more.However, assigning to it the return value of erase does not match my understanding of the code block that follows the for loop, that is issue a SAL_WARN if the button id to be deleted was not found. Now this SAL_WARN would incorrectly be triggered when the last button (the one that is last in maItemList) is successfully deleted.At first I thought about: * introducing a boolean flag ""found"" for this information,   which is a bit awkward, especially for an information that   is used only in debug mode:   bool found(false);   for(...)   {       if(...)       {           found=true;           ....       }   }   if(!found)       SAL_WARN(...) * taking more control of the looping than in a ""usual"" for loop pattern:   for (it = maItemList.begin(); ; ++it)   {       if (it == maItemList.end())       {           SAL_WARN( ""vcl.window"", ""ButtonDialog::RemoveButton(): ButtonId invalid"" );           break;       }       else if (it->mnId == nId)       {           ...       }   }but then I got the idea of just replacing the ""break"" by a ""return"" since this is the end of the function anyway."
24909,1,"Patch Set 1:Also, since you are touching this code anyway, you could (but that is optional / up to you) make the SAL_WARN message better. For example:  SAL_WARN( ""vcl.window"", ""ButtonDialog::RemoveButton(): invalid ButtonId: "" << nId);  or, if ButtonDialog had a ""getId"" or ""getName"" or some such  (which I haven't immediately found):  SAL_WARN( ""vcl.window"", ""ButtonDialog::RemoveButton(): invalid ButtonId: "" << nId << "" in ButtonDialog '"" << getName() << ""'"" );If you do it, do it in a separate commit.If you want to do that kind of ""drive-by"" improvements is up to you."

24943,1,"Patch Set 1:That SvRef overloads operator& was a very bad idea.  I would suggest not making use of it (eventually removing it, but that will probably coincide with the complete removal of SvRef), and instead adding some member function like the get() I sketched above, for clarity."

Certainly, far better than we did in the past; and where they fail that is a handler bug we can fix separately.So - I'm strongly in favour of a more friendly locking mode; the alternative: of read-only opened files, when someone else is just browsing that directory; or worse - of making everyone's directory browsing slow by needlessly locking things remotely while they browse is pretty horrible =)It seems to fix a key MIMO issue seen in the wild, and is plausible, so I'm in favour =)"

Examining the contents of the MetaFile would make a test case tricky and fragile."
25386,0,"Patch Set 1:BTW, there is an XML dumper for SVM files as well, then you can assert the contents of an SVM file using XPath, but I wouldn't go down that way here. :-)"
25387,1,"Patch Set 1:That's interesting. I had the impression that LO doesn't read SmartArt, since if I remove the contents of drawing1.xml in the original document, I get a blank page, and if I understand it correctly drawing1.xml is used only for DrawingML. If LO can import SmartArt and produce an editable diagram, why doesn't it do that by default? Unfortunately I don't have a good test document yet. For the bug page, I hacked up a version of drawing1.xml but it contains no SmartArt data."
25388,1,"Patch Set 1:SmartArt has some declarative data and also some pre-rendered drawingML result (since MSO 2010). LO only uses the drawingML result. That's still editable (depending on the setting), but it doesn't mean that you'll get the same editing experience than in MSO, what understands the declarative data as well. E.g. in LO, if the SmartArt has 5 points in a circle, then you can move one of the points, but in MSO, you can add a 6th point to the circle and it'll re-distribute them equally on the circle. In LO, the default is lock-down, so that the user is not encouraged to edit the SmartArt. If it's modified, we can preserve the declarative metadata and write it back to the OOXML file on export."

25412,1,"Patch Set 4:the vector is guaranteed to be sorted only to clients of SwpHints; the SwpHints class itself is responsible for guaranteeing that, and inside a SwpHints method the vector may be temporarily not in the proper sort order.of course no STL algorithms that depend on the ordering must be run in such a situation; do you have a concrete example that triggers an assert?"
25413,1,"Patch Set 4:> of course no STL algorithms that depend on the ordering must be run in such a situation; do you have a concrete example that triggers an assert?Yes. As I said, I have reproduced it. It's not theoretical. Unfortunately, the doc that triggers it is impossible to share (it's private).The assertion happens as a result of calling Delete (line 2853) after entering the loop under ""// change all attributes with key i"". That loop (line 2862-2871) modifies the items of the sorted_vector. If that large loop in that function has more entries to merge, it hits Delete on line 2853 a second time, which calls GetStartOf, which searches for the SwTxtAttr* via lower_bound in the sorted_vector (which might fail because the items are no longer sorted, but asserts in dbgutil builds).The only downside to my fix is the potential performance hit, but I don't see any obvious fixes that prevents the issue, so correctness first."
25414,1,"Patch Set 7:> 5. i'm actually wondering what the ""check if deletion actually took place before destroying attribute"" nonsense is: perhaps it was a work-around for this bug? clearly Delete() can't fail?My thoughts exactly. Delete() may fail due to unsorted vector, and freeing the item that is still accessible in the vector will certainly not be a good idea.I'd add a comment to this effect for posterity, but not enough confidence to remove the check.

The two functions use the functions in util.cxx to get the information.jfw_findAndSelectJRE uses the two new functions to check for such Java installations and uses them if there are any, otherwise uses the algorithm that is currently used.This would avoid duplicate code in jfw_findAndSelectJRE and getAllJREInfos.2) Add additional (out) parameters to getAllJREInfos and jfw_plugin_getAllJavaInfos that hold the JavaInfos that have been found using JAVA_HOME or PATH.possible new signature:javaPluginError jfw_plugin_getAllJavaInfos(    rtl_uString *sVendor,    rtl_uString *sMinVersion,    rtl_uString *sMaxVersion,    rtl_uString * * arExcludeList,    sal_Int32  nSizeExcludeList,    JavaInfo*** parJavaInfo,    sal_Int32 *nSizeJavaInfo,    JavaInfo** parJavaInfoFromJavaHome,    JavaInfo*** parJavaInfosFromPath,    sal_Int32 *nSizeJavaInfosFromPath);If JAVA_HOME points to a suitable Java installation, parJavaInfoFromJavaHome points to it.If suitable Java installations are on the PATH, parJavaInfosFromPath holds the respective JavaInfos and nSizeJavaInfosFromPath is the number of JavaInfos found on the PATH.The additional parameters would be unused for ""normal"" calls to the method and only be used in jfw_findAndSelectJRE (which is possibly no good design?).3) Add an additional field to the _JavaInfo struct that tells how the Java installation has been found. I currently don't have a reasonable idea how to actually implement that field - which should be able to tell e.g. that the Java installation is referred to by JAVA_HOME, and/or is the 1st Java on the PATH, the 2nd Java on the PATH,..., or has been found in a different way.As far as I understand, the struct is defined in include/jvmfwk/framework.h and the new field would thus also be visible from outside the ""jvmfwk"" module.I personally consider solution 1) to be the best of those three, but would appreciate your feedback. Of course, a totally different solution is welcome, too."

27756,0,Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2 Verified+1Beautiful - thanks Daniel ! =)
27757,0,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1(2 comments)Looks good, with a bit of cleanup. Did you test your perl script on Windows and/or Mac ?"
27783,0,"Patch Set 2:Looks good to me, thanks! :-) I'll merge it in a bit. A few nitpicks (I've corrected these locally):- Tests should be in the export suites, otherwise WW8AttributeOutput::NumberingLevel() and DocxAttributeOutput::NumberingLevel() is not tested.- Please follow the coding style of the surrounding code, { goes to the start of the new line in these files.- In new code, in most cases you can and should use just bool, not sal_Bool."
27784,1,"Patch Set 3:Hi Mikos, I don't understand how export tests were done. That's why I did it in a more conservative way, putting it in import tests.It is my concern that numbering types are not one to one mapping. A sequence like import, export, import lose information by nature. For example there are many cases fallback into NUMBER_LOWER_ZH. However it seems that the patchset for rtfexport can compile ( did it ever make check? ) , It contradict my guess."
27785,1,"Patch Set 3:When designing the framework, we had two basic ideas:- interesting document models are easier to be loaded from some format, than building them from code- checking an in-memory document model is reasonably easy (usually by using the UNO API), at least easier than asserting a written file (think of manually checking a binary .doc result)That's why for export tests, we do an import->export->import sequence. That ensures that the doc. models can be still stored in a file, allows asserting the result using the UNO API, and still export problems are detected. (I'm just re-stating what's in sw/qa/extras/README, just in case for some reason that file is not clear.) Hopefully this makes it clear how export tests are done. :-)Regarding loosing data during import/export: sure, sometimes that's necessary when e.g. our numbering types and MSO's numbering types do not match. In your case, the provided tests passed just fine when also the exporter got included in the chain, that's why I changed that. As long as it passes, it's safe to change, and it ensures that your export improvements won't break in the future silently. ;-)"
27787,0,Patch Set 1:Caolan: thought you might validate this typo fix error (following ui migration). Hope it would be available for 4.3.4

27829,1,Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1Needs clarification (see bug report)
27830,0,Patch Set 1:Hope all is okay now. :D
27833,0,"Patch Set 1:Mikos Vajna,I can only save my inline comment as draft, hence I reply here directly:1. Regarding test cases: I have test files but I'm not able to write cpp unit test code. I don't know how to submit those test files.2. Regarding numeric tokens: Those numeric tokens exists before my patch ( ex, 5=ARABIC ). You found mixing of numeric tokens and NS_ooxml:LN_something because RTF import filter share dmapper with OOXML import filte and RTF import filter implementation didn't define constants or enumeration for it."
27834,0,"Patch Set 1:Hi,Once you're ready with your inline comments, you can just push the reply + send button (without filling the textarea), and then your comments will be published.About numeric tokens: would it be possible to adjust rtftok to emit the necessary NS_ooxml::LN_something tokens instead? The idea is that RTF is a no longer developed format, while OOXML still introduces new features, so RTF is a subset of OOXML. Based on that, dmapper should in general handle OOXML, and rtftok should just emit those ooxml tokens, not its own ones. So there should be as minimal RTF-specific code in dmapper as possible.About unit tests, see here for documentation: http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sw/qa/extras/READMEOne RTF, one DOC and one DOCX export test would be the optimal.Thanks! :-)"
27836,0,"Patch Set 1:If you're on Linux, the easiest way is to install 'git-review', then all you have to do is typing 'git review' every time you want to upload a new version of your patch. :-)Other than that, feel free to upload a new version when you would like to have feedback. I'm happy that someone who knows something about CJK lists (I don't know much) is improving the situation here, so I'm happy to provide feedback & looking forward to merge it once it's in a reasonable shape. ;-)"
27837,0,"Patch Set 4:Looks much better, I took over at this point. I've fixed the following remaining nitpicks before merging:- style issues (surrounding code puts { at the start of the next line, so be consistent with that)- prefer prefix increment instead of postfix increment (there is a perf difference in case of real iterators)- use SAL_N_ELEMENTS- moved the tests to the CppunitTest_sw_rtfexport, so changes in rtfattributeoutput get tested as wellOne remaining thing: as a follow-up (separate) patch, could you please add at least one .doc and one .docx export test as well, so someone else in the future won't break your fixes to e.g. docxattributeoutput and ww8par*? Thanks! :-)"
27846,0,"Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1This looks good to me. I thought the switches were a bit odd too. However, do we want to support gstreamer-0-10?"
27849,1,Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1This is wrong.  The existing code is designed so that you can have both GStreamer 0.10 and 1.0 enabled.  It should remain possible to configure that way.
27850,1,"Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1Ok - didn't check the actual modules code this evening, as I was just on a leave before fixing our Precise TB.

This clearly has drawbacks if ever minor > 9.So, instead of carefully mimicking that silly formula via application of OString::number and OString::toInt* to integer literals, I would suggest turning to a more sane formula instead, like  1000*major + 10*minor(Whether it is better or worse to include micro in that formula I don't know.)"

29686,1,"Patch Set 1:@Robert Antoni Buj i Gelonch:This patch affects _C_ and not _C++_.For C we specifically only support C90 (and not C99 or later) as e.g. MSVC doesn't support newer than C90 (and gcc appears to default to that too), hence it's useful for devs with clang (which doesn't default to C90) to be able to catch potential build problems (i.e. non C90 compliant code) locally.(And incidentally LO is buildable with C++03, and can't use C++11 only features (for now), as we still need to support some older systems.)"

29698,1,"Patch Set 2:""I tested it in OS X Yosemite DP2 with -std=gnu11 and it worked well.""But what benefit would we have from compiling the (little) C code that we have with -std=gnu11?  AFAIK, we do not actively try to make use of any C99/C11 features where available in any of our C code, anyway.On the contrary, what this patch is about is restricting more capable compilers to the C89 subset (enforced upon us effectively by MSVC), so that developers across different platforms can more easily prevent adding new code violating C89 (which would otherwise break only on platforms they did not test their new code on)."

You can also save it.When you open it again, it still has the read-only state.Can we do something about this?"
29720,1,"Patch Set 3:Yes -- backport the code, or at least its relevant part, to 4.2. To be able to read, prompt for and use modify password, Impress/Draw code must read the appropriate data from ODF container - ModifyPasswordInfo bits from settings.xml. And since 4.2 Impress/Draw doesn't have that functionality yet (this is only added with my change to UnoDocumentSettings.cxx), it simply ignores the existence of modify password and allows user to edit the document w/o entering one.Otherwise, password protection created in 4.4 and newer will be null and void when opening such document in 4.3 and older"

29813,0,"Patch Set 1:Hi Maxim,1. Well the tooltip needs to be simple and descriptive and the standard single word tooltips like 'Undo' are soon to be replaced by long descriptive tooltips like 'Undo Last Action', so we would ideally want a useful tooltip that we wont have to go back to later on and change. So 'Zoom & Pan Tool' or 'Zoom and Pan Tool' are both good in my book.2. GIMP has the zoom tooltip as 'Zoom Tool: Adjust the zoom level'. The word tool simply identifies that its not a one click action button like 'Zoom In', which is why i believe the old behaviour was so not understood.3. Yes i think that button should be renamed, as i've never seen the word 'shift' used for pan in any app."

31074,1,"Patch Set 1:Ah, but indeed I build with --enable-debug, so not optimising. Presumably the (bogus) warnings are generated only when the compile is optimising? Perhaps even only when using LTO?Not sure if checking $(MSVC_USE_DEBUG_RUNTIME) is the right thing, isn't it so that we use the debug runtime when --enable-dbgutil was used, and that does not correspond 1:1 to not optimising."
31075,1,"Patch Set 1:Those warnings are from tb Win-x86_42, I think it's VS2012. But without --enable-debug. LTO is off for this machine.I think the underlying problem is the definition of SAL_WARN_IF athttp://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/include/sal/log.hxx#304For non-debug ""SAL_DETAIL_ENABLE_LOG_WARN"" is false then, and ""condition"" is never reached, so it's unused in this case, maybe that's what MSVC complains about."
31076,1,"Patch Set 1:Sure, sure, but the point is that it is (in my not so humble opinion) wrong if the compiler claims that variables are ""unused"" if they occur only in the right-hand-side of an && expression where the left-hand-side is a false constant.

If done at all, those assignment ops should arguably be better left implicitly declared.  (The rationale for the non-inline definition of all those exception classes' special functions is to avoid proliferation of weak vtables.)

So, I just react to the comments.If this patch causes that Draw behaves different way when pasting from Writer and Draw then it is even less intuitive that the previous behavior and I suggest to revert it.IMHO, it should not matter where you paste from. Also all LO appications should handle the pasting the same way.When I think about it, the confusion might be in the definition of selected object. If you select part of text in Writer and paste something, the selected text is overwritten, so writer behaves the same way as Draw.The problem is that in Writer, if no test is selected, the cursor is somewhere between two characters and pasted text is added. No text is selected most of the time when you write a text. You need to do explict action (select the text) to overwrite it.In draw, the last added or edited object is always selected, so most of the time some object is selected. This causes that the last object is overwritten when pasting. You need to do explicit action (deselect the object) to avoid overwriting.To be honest I am not sure how to solve this.PS: I am sorry if I added the comment a wrong way. I am not familiar with the current Gerrint interface. I did not find any way how to replay any existing comment."

I think this code did what was intended only with the old container which was semi-array and semi-associative container...

Patch set 1 has the two lines with problems disabled (to allow building) and has some additional output code for ease of fault finding. This extra code could be made more neat and submitted as a separate patch, it may be useful for other occasions.Finally, I would like to add extra lines with NETWORKDAYS.INTL and WORKDAY.INTL to the unittest xlxs-document. The current lines are not representative for the possible argument values for weekend days and holidays."

34991,0,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2 Verified+1Looks good, thanks.Nitpick: see how ooxmlimport's testFdo65090 can test the column separators using the UNO API, without looking into the XML directly.

34995,1,"Patch Set 8: Code-Review-1The use of AC_CHECK_LIB(c, ...) to look for a function in the normal C library that the compiler uses is bogus. (For instance, nothing guarantees that the C library is called ""c"". ) There is AC_CHECK_FUNCS for that, and it automatically sets the corresponding HAVE_FOO variables, no need to do it explicitly. (The existing use of AC_CHECK_FUNCS in configure.ac is slightly weird in that sense.) Anyway, I don't see how you would make those HAVE_FOO things you add propagate to the compilations?Also, I don't think it can be strictly correct to assume that a non-standard function like me malign, if it happens to exist, would have the semantics the code expects. Better to let the code that explicitly uses it explicitly just for Android be as is, IMHO. (The strictly correct thing would be to actually run a test during the configury to find out what memalign, does, if it exists. But that would be quite overkill, LO is not supposed to be portable to all possible and impossible OSes anyway, and besides, for cross-compilations (like for Android), such tests couldn't be run at configure time anyway."

36023,1,"Patch Set 9:the build failure is not due to this patch, I'll reschedule when it becomes available again now that the build failure is fixed in master.Yes, the GetGraphics returns NULL when there is no available graphics available for use by the caller. e.g. because there is a limited number of them which can be in use at any given time and they are all already in use. Some implementations can hand out a new one always, which is the simple case, some can have only one ""checked out"" at a time, and most have a pool where there can have a limited bunch in place at any one time."

Far simpler and safer would be to just rename GetGraphics to AcquireGraphics, which solves the problem and is safer.Also, one commit for one problem, mixing indendation changes, sal_Bool to bool and extra problems in one patch is making it very hard to unpick what's going on in any given commit.Leave this patch with me a while and I'll turn it into a GetGraphics->AcquireGraphics change and split out some of the additional bits in separate commits."

37780,1,"Patch Set 1: Do not mergeI still don脭脟脰t see any sense in removing it. It solves a couple of issues: it checks adapter existence before enabling / disabling it instead of checking everywhere, it should help to acquire adapter the proper way on higher platforms [1] instead of duplicating code everywhere. Plus you instantiate property directly but I was trying to init them in constructors only to avoid mess. Null checks is just element of style so I can close my eyes on this part.Anyway my vote seems to be ignored at all. [1]:https://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothAdapter.html"
37781,0,"Patch Set 1:Hmm, I'm not entirely 100% sure about this, but:getDefaultAdapter still exists and should work according to the API (it's not marked as deprecated, the methods docs haven't changed), and hence should work for us for all supported Android versions. Moreover there are no reports of it breaking with 4.3 that I can find (I imagine there'd be quite some uproar if existing apps were suddenly broken by Android 4.3)...It seems the getSystemService way of getting the adapter was added for consistency (as that's how the Wifi adapter is usually retrieved) -- and it's use is obviously encouraged for new apps, but we specifically want to support 2.3+ for now, so still need to at least have getDefaultAdapter.So, unless there is specific evidence that getDefaultAdapter has been broken we only need to support getDefaultAdapter and can ignore the getSystemService way of doing things, in which case the wrapper is unnecessary. (And in future once we no longer need to support < 4.3 we can migrate to whatever the wonderful new consistent API is.)"
37782,1,"Patch Set 1:> it checks adapter existence before enabling / disabling it > instead of checking everywhere,1st of all that's not true. You're just wrapping the check into a function call, so that decision is just hidden behind a function and still executed everytime, just hidden between two or three levels of indirection. This makes the code harder to understand, harder to get into for newcomers.Newcomers read Android's api to understand what's going on and are thrown off by wrappers that they have to track through different files.2nd enabling/disabling the adapter is only triggered/used once each. So this is far from ""everywhere"".3rd your (I assume it is yours, since you're defending it so much) code acquires the adapter way more often than the changed code, where once it is acquired, it is stored in the member variable(s). The old code always calls getDefaultAdapter(), take for example the getPairingDeviceName() function.1st time when calling isAvailable, that indirects to getAdapter that in turn calls getDefaultAdapter.2nd time in the check for a device name (uses getAdapter that indirects to getDefaultAdapter3rd time when returning the name.And this for each Bluetooth device that is found. > it should help to acquire adapter the proper way on  > higher platforms [1] instead of duplicating code everywhere.Again you're making it hard for me to take your argumentation seriously. This has been mentioned in the previous comments already. A) There's absolutely no reason to introduce runtime-version checks. This would not only complicate the code, but more importantly doing test on the various codepaths. I would personally object any change that introduces a runtime version check without actual need for it. If docs would say: function will be removed in next version of Android, that would be a different story. But for the foreseeable future, the functionality will remain the same, B) Even when you want to acquire the adapter depending on the version, then *one single public static method* is enough to do this, no need for a whole class that wraps's the BluetoothAdapter's API. Apart from acquiring the actual adapter, there are absolutely no changes in the API. > Plus you instantiate property directlynot sure what you mean with property, I guess calling the actual API on the adapter? Yes, indeed I do it directly, since I believe in KISS - and I cannot think of anything simpler than just calling the function that is properly documented in the API docs, that every Android developer having dealt with BT already knows... >  but I was trying to init them in constructors only to > avoid mess.I absolutely cannot follow where. The Operator-wrapper's constructor is empty. And for launching the activities, you use intents, not constructors. I cannot find any occurrence where you'd pass the adapter in a constructor. (and also don't see a benefit), as it's static and can just be obtained on a if-needed basis. > Null checks is just element of style so I can close my > eyes on this part.I absolutely don't understand this comment either. You have *plenty* of null checks in the operator and in other places of the code, and they are the most straightforward/only way to check whether something is null. It also makes it immediately clear to the person reading the code that whatever is bound to the check won't happen because that adapter is null.  > Anyway my vote seems to be ignored at all.It is not that it is ignored, just that I have a completely different view on this topic. I want the code to be straightforward, easy to understand by people not familiar with it (just like I was before writing this patch. I neither had a take at android development, let alone the remote). I find all those redirections highly irritating. KISS should be the prime goal here. I see no need to split a function that happily fits on my small screen (i.e. less than 30 lines) if the parts that it is split into are not reusable/not used anywhere else.I also see absolutely no point in creating a wrapper to one-line function calls.If the Operator-wrapper would do more stuff that things that can be put into a single 80-column-line, then I'd be happy to keep that functionality, but all it has is a) a ""renamed"" null-check. A function that just returns the value of a comparison != null.and on top of that it unnecessarily requires the adapter anew. (something that can probably be optimized out by the compiler/the runtime, but still something I consider unnecessary. b) a ""enable"" function, that just calls the API function of the same name(wrapped along with the useless isAvailable check that you very likely already had checked before even trying to enable the adapter) c) a ""disable"" function where the same remarks as for the enable function apply, d) the getAdapter wrapper, that does nothing but call the getDefaultAdapter() API function.I see that this is the most debatable, and the one that is the only one that has at least a minimalistic reason to exist.But as written earlier: I see absolutely no reason why want to have runtime version checks if the code happily runs on the newest devices unchanged. After all we even use compatibility/support libraries to support old versions, why would you jeopardize this by explicitly targeting newer versions with such a runtime check?After all all that changes is the way to get a BlueToothAdapter object, nothing else. If newer Android version had a different Bluetooth api, then this would be a completely different story (but then again probably handled by the support libraries, so nothing one would have to deal with manually).And after all: I wrote a patch that fixes stuff. So that's why I in this case value my own opinion higher than yours (cynicism, don't take too seriously). I'm aware that I'm stepping on your toes now, and I'm sorry for that. But I won't change my opinion on this because of that.* my changes fix a couple of bugs* no previous functionality is lost* the wrapper did only most trivial stuffIn my opinion it makes the code much easier to grasp without all that redirection. Quoting from the Zen of Python (that applies here as well): [脭脟陋] Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. [脭脟陋] Flat is better than nested. [脭脟陋] Readability counts. [脭脟陋]I hope the long response shows that I'm not simply ignoring your opinion, just that I don't share it.I'd rather add other missing features (like locking screen orientation and adding the ""laser-pointer"" feature) than arguing about this."
37786,0,"Patch Set 1:My only comment is that the old code conveyed some additional degree of information in the method names e.g. rememberBluetoothState(), restoreBluetoothState(), etc, that is now lost, or at least no longer obvious.It might be useful to retain some of that information by adding comments to the now inlined code."
37787,1,"Patch Set 1:Thanks for the comment re the telling function names that are no longer preserved - this is true, however in later commits that handling gets revamped anyway, for example instead of all that was-bt-enabled stuff there is then only a member variable ""disableBTOnQuit that keeps the state and has a telling name:private static final BluetoothAdapter btAdapter = BluetoothAdapter.getDefaultAdapter();private static boolean disableBTOnQuit = btAdapter != null && !btAdapter.isEnabled();all the other state-saving/retrieval is moot that way, and the disabling of BT reduces toif (isFinishing() && disableBTOnQuit) { btAdapter.disable();}Similar for the setup of the viewpager/the tabs.I only created the split commits because I was asked to provide atomic commits - but that also means I'm touching parts of the code multiple other times in the later patches."

If you mean it should be buildable by ant/using the makefiles and not by using Eclipse, you should see that I also updated the makefile.I didn't bother to add a check whether the v7 support library has been installed on the machine, as it is not built as part of LO anyway, and the error message will be pretty obvious in that case....If you insist, I can also add configure checks.

I did swap dependencies for the contrary, to make it easier to extend later with new features. Even the author of the ABS wrote that ABS has done its job, that with the android support lib v7 there is no reason to use ABS anymore. That of course doesn't mean one should swap components, never change a running system yadda,yadda, but the remote is small, the change as a whole is small, so it is (IMHO) a sensible thing to do.You also state on the one-hand pre honeycomb (aka gingerbread) would look different, but on the other hand you're willing to just drop support for gingerbread completely. So I fail to see how this then is a concern regarding this patch."
37803,1,"Patch Set 1:In general looks good to me :)The only problems I can see are with the project.properties:1.Presumably we want to bump the target to 17 here?2.Using ${sdk.dir} doesn't work with eclipse -- *maybe* it's worth having a ../v7-appcompat instead, and adding the project to the git repo, but ultimately I suspect we want to migrate from having ant OR eclipse, to using gradle which apparently uses exactly the same build no matter whether you are in an ide or not (but I haven't looked into the details so can't confirm how this works).Sorry, I can't easily quote previous reviews for some reason, but here are my view on the other issues:* API versions:> but there is a *really low* percentage of users using Gingerbreadas discussed on IRC and possibly the ML a few times, we want to support the vast majority of Android devices, that means at least API 10, and nothing wrong with going lower if we don't lose features (see http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html to see that API 10 is still about 30% of the market)* ABS:Also been discussed on IRC, we specifically want to get rid of ABS, both for the remote and for the main android app in order to reduce complexity & maintenance -- having ABS in the way is somewhat of a blocker for splitting the Impress Remote repo out, or would alternatively result in duplication between repos...Yes, we need to update the build guide, but the new procedure is simply different and not more complicated.* Build servers:- That's up to the tb maintainers to upgrade (same as the previous comment on installing the correct lib), not really an issue -- there is going to be significant change anyway when the repo is split, so worst case the tbs might be disabled for a short time, but they aren't hugely important for the remote."
37804,1,"Patch Set 1:> The only problems I can see are with the project.properties: > 1.Presumably we want to bump the target to 17 here?Eclipse's target version is different from the target in the manifest. Manifest basically that newer versions should enable compatibility mode and not apply for example a new system-theme. While target in properties defines what SDK Eclipse will use / defines the maximum api you can use without getting errors - so if you'd want to add runtime checks for versions > 14, then you'd need to raise the limit. As it currently is, it could even be lowered to minSDK..  > 2.Using ${sdk.dir} doesn't work with eclipse --Yes, but there is no way to know the relative path to the SDK from the build-tree beforehand. Even when checked into the code, then in Ecplipse it will only work when you don't copy stuff to your workdir (as then relative paths are again different).As having a correct path is not enough in Ecplipse, but you have to add the library project as an additional project in Eclipse anyway, I don't consider this a problem. I have to adjust the library reference in the code that uses abs, and also with the one that uses the android support lib. > *maybe* it's worth having a ../v7-appcompat instead, and > adding the project to the git repo,This will make building with ant easier, as you then can skip the python statement to determine the relative path, but would not help /that/ much for Eclipse. You would still have to import both the v7-appcompat as well as the sdremote projects.(in any case: only halfway nice, as it ""pollutes"" the sourcetree, as opposed to other parts of the LO sourcecode that leave the sourcetree alone, but do all the work in workdir or previously solver)"

[...]I agree -- setting up Eclipse requires following the user manual and isn't plug'n'play either way so makes sense to optimise the non-eclipse case etc.Looking into the (or a possible) future, I'm investigating upgrading to the Android Studio / gradle build system which will *massively* simplify things (add ""compile ""com.android.support:appcompat-v7:18.0.+"""" to the dependencies and you are ready to go...), but that's completely separate to this change in any case... That could probably be done in parallel to the current build, but I'll probably send that to the ML once I know more..."

39001,0,"Patch Set 3: AbandonedWe have to set the values to the _maximum_ SDK we want to use. Otherwise Windows features will be dropped and not be available to LibreOffice. If features are implemented eg. since Windows Vista we need to do runtime checks and define the corresponding structs, function and so on.But the minimum supported Windows version must be checked with _WIN32_WINNT set to the corresponding version. And get a regular build to detect such problems! If this is set to WinXP (0x0502) only parts of the SDK are enabled, which are within these conditionals (checked by _NTDDI_VERSION, _WIN32_WINNT and sometimes _WINVER). Defining _WIN32_WINNT defines both other macros to the same value. Only by setting _WIN32_WINNT we could detect incompatible features, which build fine on Windows 7 and don't work on Windows XP/Vista/whatever.Those WINVER conditionals are bogus, because they are highly dependant on the build machine! If the sources are build on Windows XP and delivered for all other versions of Windows only Windows XP features are included. If we build on Windows 7 and have runtime checks for special calls to windows functions, which are only >=Windows 7"

39003,0,"Patch Set 5: Verified; Looks good to me, approved"
39008,1,"Patch Set 1:No, that wouldn't be right. The docu says ""If you define NTDDI_VERSION, you must also define _WIN32_WINNT."". So we should use both. Somewhere I read that NTDDI_VERSION was the new approach to overcome all those different macros (esp. because of the former 98/NT difference). But rumor says, that it's not fully supported - as the documentation says, too.For simplicity I would only set _WIN32_WINNT and WINVER. And replace _WIN32_WINDOWS with _WIN32_WINNT ."
39009,1,Patch Set 1:I still don't understand why we need to define any of these in out sources? What breaks if we just leave out them?
39010,1,"Patch Set 1:And pointing to stuff in mingw-specific mailing lists is hardly that relevant as we don't build with mingw? (We used to be able to cross-compile most of the sources with mingw, but that hasn't been maintained and is presumably badly broken at the moment.)"
39011,0,"Patch Set 1:I chose the mingw mailing list entry, because there's a nice compilation of old WINVER defines, which the Microsoft documentation doesn't offer :)And at the moment we need to set WINVER because it has everywhere different values. Or we have hacks like adefd564d07a6e70cc1d9fad8febe5b434511e83 or a9fd489834b63e423d4745f0d71cf15396e3e3eb. At least for fpicker it's relevant because with 0x0501 you wouldn't get the window previews in the taskbar with Vista/7. So we need 0x0600 there, but we can't set it global to the project if we still want to support Windows XP.But you're right, after that commit many of them could be simply dropped."
39014,1,"Patch Set 6:on closer examination it turns out the warnings (at least in sal) come from outdated precompiled headers - so clearly i was wrong and i take back the previous comment :)this needs a ""make clean"" apparently."
39015,0,"Patch Set 6:Sorry, I didn't mention it, but yes this does need a make clean. The patch was indeed finished.I didn't wonder about the WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN redefinition, because this is how it's done in some other makefiles. Thanks for fixing this.Nice that this finally got into core :)"
39017,0,"Patch Set 2:Now the settings are applied globally.And I found out how to use the macros:_WIN32_WINNT sets NTDDI_VERSION and WINVER automatically to the same version.But setting NTDDI_VERSION or WINVER sets only the macro itself.If we want to target Windows XP we need to set _WIN32_WINNT, because otherwise other SDK stuff is still included under Windows 7. But this brings us some kind of dilemma: How do we add features which are added in Windows 7 (like 9a4a84df5406cdcde1f4d23a1cea2b109998f35b)? If we set WINVER globally those features are never activated.One solution could be to check:#ifdef NTDDI_WIN7Works fine, but checks only what is supported by the Windows API (what if Win8 SDK is installed on Win7?).Maybe we should move this to the mailing list."

That way then it would be possible to avoid introducing the ugly DECLARE_OOXML_TEST / RUN_OOXML_TEST macros.I mean such a change causes some pain on backports, so if we do it, I think we should do it properly, not hiding copy&paste behind macros. :-)"

39980,0,"Patch Set 1: This need some tweaks before it is mergedIs there something missing here, what value is LO_LDFLAGS supposed to get?"
39981,0,Patch Set 1:Roi replied in personal email:Nothing it should get no value in the configure stage you can't now the results of the build But a script from Xcode can populate it for the build so it automatically scan the libs and populate the value for the xcconfig
39982,1,Patch Set 1:Ah but then it is pointless to have it in lo.xcconfig.in.
39983,0,Patch Set 1:Well I needed an anchor to add the data and when adding new variables in to an xcconfig file dynamically you need to restart Xcode. another way is to resolve this using gbuild at the end of build somehow
39984,1,"Patch Set 1:Hmm, not sure I follow, but OK... Without the corresponding script, though, this now means others will not be able to build the MobileLibreOffice app, right?Also, I think the name LO_LDFLAGS is misleading, as it isn't consistent with the other LO_FOO settings in lo.xcconfig(.in), which originate from LO's configury. Some other name would be better, and please don't use ""LDFLAGS"" in the name as ""LDFLAGS"" traditionally is used for flags, not a list of libraries.Sorry if this seems like nitpicking, but experience has taught me that code needs to use existing conventions and terminology to be understandable later..."
39985,1,Patch Set 1:Well this is LDFLAGS not a list of libraries it adds -l and -L and any other flags needed to link against Libreoffice static lib repository and it is added to Xcode other link flags so LDFALGS is accurate for the LO part tell me what is the best prefix

(No idea why not ""Page 1 2/2"".) In this zero case, it says ""Page 0/4"", which is a bit confusing.OTOH I guess it improves the current situation, so let's get it in.Oh, and one more thing: in SwLayHelper::CheckInsertPage(), it's not trivial why you check the page number of the *follow* style. It would be great to have a follow-up commit that adds a comment, explaining that."
39992,0,"Patch Set 3:> vmiklos: I have updated all the relevant places to now use 'optional'.Great, thanks!> In 'sw/source/ui/utlui/uitool.cxx' the 'SfxUInt16Item aPageNum' is set in the function 'SwToSfxPageDescAttr'. Question is - now that 'GetNumOffset' *could* return NULL - what should be done if it *is* null ? should we set '0' to the 'SfxUInt16Item' (like I've done) ?If we're speaking about SwToSfxPageDescAttr(), what about just not putting the SfxPoolItem to the item set? Of course, then the consumer of that item set (insert->manual break dialog?) should handle the lack of the pool item in the set, but I guess that's logical: item missing -> ""change page number"" checkbox is false, item there -> ""change page number"" checkbox is true and the value can be even 0, if you need it.> In 'sw/source/ui/table/tabledlg.cxx' the code *used* to set the 'NumericField' with the value from the 'GetNumOffset()' function, but now it returns an optional value. so if the value is NULL - should it *not* set the NumericValue or it *should* set it, but with 0 (like I've done) ?This is the UI I was mentioning above. :) I guess null should be ""checkbox false, numeric field empty"", while 0 should be ""checbox true, numeric field 0"". Hopefully that's intuitive enough."

40645,0,"Patch Set 5: This need some tweaks before it is mergedAlso here some more explanation would be great, as this is not iOS-only code, but cross-platform.So the commit comment is a bit misleading, too."
40647,1,Patch Set 5:The vigra::copyImage is not handling copy areas in the same image so the code is checking whether the src and dst are same buffer and directing it to scaleImage which is very slow.The whole concept of pixel accessors is a huge overhead in the case of direct pixel copy (vigra::copyImage is also using pixel accessors).The idea here was to identify when direct memory copy is applicable (when src.size==dst.size && src.format==dst.format) and use direct memory block copy and not pixel wise copy.The result is 100x faster than vigra implementation.This direct copy is also handling the case when the src and dst are same buffer by copy it from bottom to top when needed and using memmove instead of memcpyabout using long or int for iterating i'm not keen on the cross platform details please advice how to do it properly.
40648,1,"Patch Set 5:Yep, no beef with the function per se - my verbose comment was more a documentation of why this is a good idea. ;)For the variables - please double-check this, but from the math, sal_Int32 should be sufficient. This is on all of our platforms interchangeable with int, so why not use that.If the original intend of long was 'something bigger than int', then you should use sal_Int64 (I doubt it is needed though)."
40649,1,"Patch Set 7: Verified; Looks good to me, approvedFound the problem, it wasn't a fencepost error after all, but the problem was with 1- and 4-bit-per-pixel formats, where obviously it doesn't make sense to copy pixels with memmove() (unless one adds complexity by first copying an integral number of bytes and then any remaining bits). I am not sure that is worth it, for now I just added a condition to call the new implDrawBitmapDirect()  only for formats that use an integral number of bytes per pixel."

40822,0,"Patch Set 1: This need some tweaks before it is mergedNearly there - great work finding the place! :-)  Unfortunately it does not work perfectly yet; it does the right thing when you are decreasing the size of sidebar (going with the mouse pointer to the right), but not when you are increasing it (going to the left).  Can you please have a look?Instead of computing the delta, and trying to apply it the right way, can we change it to act with absolute values there?  That way might be easier than trying to find out the constraints for the delt, couldn't it?"
40823,0,"Patch Set 6:Great work - thank you for that! :-)Before pushing, I did a small modification; instead of if() for checking the max size, I changed that to a min() function which will ensure that we set the maximal size in case the mouse pointer was moved very far away."

40825,0,"Patch Set 3:Hi Kendy,We have 2 cases here, when the sidebar is attached towards the  lhs/rhs of screen. Under each case, we need to track whether the mouse is been dragged towards left or right, because of which the track of 'nDelta' is important.Moreover, I think the absolute values would not work perfectly for each desktop because mnMaxSize stores the container width of the current working desktop. For me, this value is 1366 which may differ for desktop to desktop, that is why I preferred using this value instead of working directly with absolute values."
40826,1,"Patch Set 3:I probably wasn't clear - as you can see, the delta is being used as a value to increase or decrease nNewSize.  Instead, I think we should compute nNewSize directly based on the mouse pointer position - this is what I meant by 'absolute'; ie. 'absolute' in the term that you will do nNewSize = function_of(mouse_pointer_position); not nNewSize = previous_size + nDelta;  Does this make sense, or is there anything else that prevents this?"

40951,0,"Patch Set 1:removing commented sections is usually rather safe -- cherry-picking is somewhat robust against that. For blank lines, there is no convention on how many we should have were, so this might easily lead to a fight over that (and we shouldnt bother with that then).

We need the clean up but we need to keep the readability. And do not break the code ;-)Also we should not change the style too often. Even the comments might create conflicts when merging fixes between branches.I wonder if you do the patch using a script or manually. I think that it is best to do this using some scripts (bash,sed, perl).In each case, I strongly suggest to split such changes into more commits next time. The big patch was wery hard to review (hard to keep concentration, my right hand was aching after going through all the pages). So, you could get faster feedback with a smaller patch. Also, you will be able to do the other parts better after the feedback. Finally, it will help you to keep concentration as well. Note that you even removed two pieces of code by mistake."

41379,0,"Patch Set 5: This need some tweaks before it is merged1) Is the helpcontent2 hunk of the patch intentional?2) It seems the patch mixes two ways: on one hand, it adds a support for restart being 0 (and using -1 for ""not set""), but it also adds a boolean flag to ""avoid"" changing unsigned membes to signed ones. I think adding a new boolean member is fine, but then please check for that boolean everywhere, and don't do the 0 -> 1 change.3) Seems most of the heavy-lifting in core is about allowing a restart with value == 0, but the testcase doesn't check this, only a normal restart.I would suggest either adding a section with such a ""zero restart"" as well, of just do the fixes in two separate commits: one commit adding just the restart support, and an other fixing the zero restart corner case."
41381,0,"Patch Set 5:I mean, my understanding is:Previously, the page number offset was a single unsigned integer, where 0 meant ""no restart"", other values meant a restart with a positive value. This is obviously a problem if you want to have a restart with a zero value.The patch introduces bNumOffsetIsSet to signal if the page number offset is valid, this is a good move. However at other places it also starts to use -1 to signal that the page number offset is valid or not, so now we have two places storing the same info (bNumOffsetIsSet == true or page number offset == -1), which looks redundant."
41382,1,"Patch Set 5:I think I will simply remove the boolean flag, change it from 'unsigned int' to 'signed int' and analyze all the places that use the function to get the value, to make sure I don't corrupt any existing logic.That way - in the entire codebase - '0 or more' will mean a specific page start value, and 'negative value' means no page start value."

41621,1,"Patch Set 3:Well, I cannot argue with the compiler. If it says that it wants a copy constructor, I will have to give it one. :-)I was not aware of that detail of the 98 C++ standard, and it is a bit unintuitive. Why should a copy constructor be called when constructing a temporary object?Anyway, I will check how to tell GCC to be strict about the 98 C++ standard, recompile and resubmit the patch.Is there anything I have to do apart from that, e.g., somehow reverting the commit?"
41622,1,"Patch Set 3:The former warning goes away (of course) if I remove the private constructors for that class that your patch added, but the latter one is more complicated. The multitude of virtual and non-virtual addFailuer() methods in the multiple-inherited base classes of TextTestResult is quite confusing to me, and apparently also to the Clang version I use on Linux (clang version 3.2 (branches/release_32 170558)).

The type is readily available as a string via Any::getValueTypeName (and it would arguably be a good idea to always include it in the output, like ""Any of type T with value V"", or for cases where we have no code to print the value just ""Any of type T,"" or something less verbose but containing the same amount of information).* The TypeClass values UNION and ARRAY are unused historic mistakes; and typelib_TypeClass_MAKE_FIXED_SIZE is an artefact of the UNO C++ language binding, not a legal value of UNO enum TypeClass.* Likewise, the TypeClass values TYPEDEF, SERVICE, MODULE, INTERFACE_METHOD, INTERFACE_ATTRIBUTE, UNKNOWN, PROPERTY, CONSTANT, CONSTANTS, and SINGLETON are only used to represent UNOIDL entities unrelated to the UNO type system.  They are never used for values of type Any.* Likewise, a UNO ANY cannot contain a nested ANY (cf. <http://www.openoffice.org/udk/common/man/typesystem.html>).  That is, all cases other than VOID, BOOLEAN, BYTE, SHORT, UNSIGNED_SHORT, LONG, UNSIGNED_LONG, HYPER, UNSIGNED_HYPER, FLOAT, DOUBLE, CHAR, STRING, TYPE, SEQUENCE, ENUM, STRUCT, EXCEPTION, and INTERFACE should be subsumed under  default:    assert(false); // this cannot happen    break;(And whenever I write code that lists all those UNO type system tags, I stick with the above order as given at <http://www.openoffice.org/udk/common/man/typesystem.html>, not the completely stupid and arbitrary one from the TypeClass enum.)* Add @since LibreOffice 4.2."

SpreadsheetML (...) stored in the ISO 8601 format > however can't find any reference to > http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime in there > where did the idea come from that that was relevant?The function is called GetDateTimeFromW3CDTF. Duckduckgoing(or Googling) for W3CDTF makes it clear that ""W3CDTF"" usuallymeans http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime, so I assumed thatthis was the format the function was supposed to parse. 1) Was the W3CDTF in the function name meant as a reference     to that note? Dunno, ask its author. 2) In that case, was the reference itself an error? Michael's     research seems to indicate this would be the case.IRC (or mailing list?) discussion also basically said that as faras we know, the timezone component of this fix may not mattermuch since Microsoft Office always writes UTC (Zulu) time,so the bug would never get triggered. I think that it is stillpreferable to fix the bug to avoid that other code calls thisfunction in situations where the bug happens.So, my opinion would be:1) As proactive safety, apply this patch to master & 4-1.    (possibly an adapted part of it to 4-0; adapted because    sub-second stuff is different in 4-0: centiseconds instead    of nanoseconds) 2) In master, provided we have a volunteer to unravel that     quagmire (that knows about OOXML or willing to find out     about it), merge with sax::Converter date/time-parsing     if appropriate... If not appropriate, maybe migrate this     function to sax::Converter (along with documentation-by-     comment explaining why we need different parsers for     different formats and the difference between them), so     that our date/time-parsing code is all in one place.Since nobody clearly vetoed this patch, I'm going to push ""1)"" to master soon, unless someone vetoes."

The reason why I tried to reduce the amount of virtual methods on this class is to limit the amount of surprises and makes it easier to track who's using what method.  Turning this to a virtual would add that down-side again... Once a method becomes virtual, it also becomes harder to track how it's used, and making it more difficult to debug for all users of this class.The only way to be sure there is no side effect is to test all places where this class is used....

41948,1,"Patch Set 1: This need some tweaks before it is mergedWork in progress. This is a quite complex dialog, full of corner conditions1) Widget sizes should be adjusted at will2) The Line preview (CTL_PREVIEW) need to be fixed for correct display3) To test the dialog: Create a spreadsheet with one graphic object and one line chart. 4) Inside the chart, select the data series line object and click ""format selection"". The icon sub-dialog now appears. In the icon sub-dialog, the menu button allows many choices. The #define scalars for the menu choices had to be adjusted. I have no idea on the scalar  values definition except by looking at the packing of the menuitem (order in packing).The Gallery option shows a long list of graphics objects, not all work, specially png's and svg's. This is a bug, and I wil file it when the patch is committed.5) Selecting the graphic object outside the chart will show arrow styles and corner & caps sub-menus. Adjust listbox sizes at will.6) The previous non-widget dialog had glitches in the enable/disable condition for the arrow styles starts/ends.7) A whishlist: Some GtK widgets (mostly listboxes and spinboxes) should have a label associated, so that Enable/Disable and Show/Hidecan be simplified (like checkboxes and radiobuttons)."

Now, strictly speaking, one would need to check that pDateTime->Year >= 0 before assining it to aSystemTime.wYear in osl_getTimeValueFromDateTime.  However, wYear is documented as ""The valid values for this member are 1601 through 30827,"" so negative pDateTime->Year values would in practice wrap around to wYear >= 32768 > 30827 and SystemTimeToFileTime should return false, so everything should happen to work out fine."

Just two small things.a) Keep the %VARIABLE stuff in the new .ui stuff. There was a bug in the %PRODUCTNAME replacement for items in lists which I fixed now, so that probably was the problem there. So I'll push a follow up patch to restore those variables again.b) Use ""bold"" not ""semibold"" for the frame titles, cause that's what we used for all the other ones.c) The hungarian (light version) variable naming scheme in LibreOffice is aFoo for an object and pFoo for a pointer."

42900,1,"Patch Set 2:> Heh, I wonder if such table names are supported also by the other functionality, e.g. queries, views. Anyway, this fix allows users to rename them at least ;-)That's up to the database engine. Essentially, you have to understand that ""Query"" is an SQL command that is stored by LibreOffice in the .odb file. So the ""name"" of that query is something that is up to LibreOffice, the database engine never sees it. That's why ""SELECT * from qryName"" will not work, because this will send qryName to the database engine, and it does not know it.As far as queries are concerned, code archeology shows that this special treatment of '/' in query names dates back from a ""new feature: hierarchical queries"". I have no clue what this feature is :)However, views are a database engine feature. They are an SQL command that is stored by the database engine in the database. Their name is up to the database engine. As such, they are just like tables to LibreOffice: LibreOffice selects, updates, deletes, etc from them directly (as far as supported by the database engine)."

(The use of ""header"" in the Standard does not necessarily reflect colloquial usage of that term.  The exact mechanisms are implementation-defined in any case, but the <compiler/platform> vs. ""client"" is the general idea.

43456,0,"Patch Set 1: Verified; Looks good to me, but someone else must approveMikl鈹溾攤s, thanks for your review. The simplicity of the patch is conscious. Using the character sequence ""\t"" is an artificial problem in footnote numbering, but you can specify it using standard Unicode methods, adding a zero width non joiner between ""\"" and ""t"" (U+200C).This patch fixes a real problem (*bug of the user interface* distorts the document, prohibits the stable work of a fine workaround for a long-term problem). It is not the *ideal* solution, but there were more than 10 years to fix the original problem, the missing right aligned footnote numbering, without any known result (only my Graphite solution with Linux Libertine G and Biolinum G a few years ago). I was very glad to find a general workaround not depending my particular font enhancements a few days ago, fixing it with this patch, but if you will be able to fix the original problem in a more proper way (eg. adding a check box for right alignment) for LibreOffice 4.1, I won't want to force this patch. This is only a temporary UI fix to keep stable document format. More about this problem (in Hungarian): http://libreoffice.hu/2013/06/13/jobbra-zart-labjegyzetszamozas/Thanks again. Laci"

43951,1,Patch Set 1: Do not mergeunfortunately there's a substantial problem here - Fedora ships jpeg 6 and the maintainer has publicly stated that packaging jpeg 8 will not happen:http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.redhat.fedora.devel/173253http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.redhat.fedora.devel/173299so we should not have a hard dependency on any features that are not in jpeg 6.

43958,1,"Patch Set 2:Michael, if you download the vanilla libjpeg fom here http://www.ijg.org/files/ you don't have JERR_BAD_CROP_SPEC in jpeg6b but you have it in jpeg7. Then from a user point of view JERR_BAD_CROP_SPEC means nothing and i'd prefer suggest a version that to force one download and grep source code. I think fedora (and other distros i suppose) have patched versions?"

Also changed the overly long one-line comment to a more readable comment preceding the code line. Please avoid lines longer than 120 characters if possible.Please update your patch with this one.Other than that it looks good so far, there's just one little annoyance:If from a selection one cell is removed with Ctrl+LeftClick the count is not updated, it looks as if the current cell cursor position is always counted, even if a selection not including that position exists. This is not the case with for example the CountA function for which the count is correctly decremented by one.Could you please look into that?"

45154,1,"Patch Set 2: Verified; Looks good to me, approveduploaded a new patch set just to rebase on dtardon's makefile renaming, nothing changed here.a) For aligning things the trick is to have *another* size group with the labels in it, that way they all request the same size and it works out as expected.Well, it should, it appears I have a small bug in how that works. It seems that margins should be part of the request, but I'm adding those on after the request, not as part of the request. But we can workaround that by putting a one element box around the elements with margins and put those boxes into the size group instead. That way it works now, and will continue to work after I change the request+margin logic.b) The tristates are a pain, I thought they would be very rare elements. Catch is that they are always set to ""state unknown"" on .ui load, while in .src load they default to ""state nocheck"". So, yeah, to be super sure that the logic is unchanged its best to set them explicitly in .cxx to ""state nocheck"". I'll do that in a follow up patch.c) As an aside, the accessibility relation between the checkbox and the numeric field can be retained in the .ui with label-for/label-by under the a11y tab of glade (wheelchair icon). If it was a label and a numeric field then the mnemonic_widget relationship would add a default accessibility label-for/label-by relationship which is why the other ""Start at"" element doesn't need or have that."

45409,1,"Patch Set 4:This code looks like it concerns the query design UI.If that function is called each time the user changes something in there, then the field name/formula (aField string in the code) can definitely be empty, since the user can type anything. Whether that is a valid choice, and whether we catch that ""user error"" earlier is another question. In other words: it may or may not be that in the case of an empty aField, that codepath is not taken at all. Given the situation, I'd rather not rely on aField's non-emptyness (too much).But from a semantic point of view, the issue is moot anyway, since that test should be aField == ""*""and not aField.beginsWith(""*"")I'm changing that in master."

Adding a check for a condition without knowing whether the condition can actually ever not hold is a slippery slope down ""defensive programming"" that leads to unmaintainable code.  (""What /are/ the invariants of that code?"" people will start to ask, seeing a mixture of redundant and non-redundant checks.)Given that the original code did not check for validity of accessing index 0, that could either mean that it was sloppy and ""cleverly"" relied on the fact that both String and OUString are null-terminated, so accessing index 0 is always valid technically (and the check for '*' guaranteed to fail for the empty string), or that there's an invariant enforcing aField to be non-empty anyway.Only in the first case would patch set 2 be an improvement.  In the latter case, the correct fix would rather be an assert(!aField.isEmpty()).Maybe Lionel can shed some light on this?"

Or am I wrong?""Yes, rtl::O[U]String::operator[] -- with documented prerequisite ""index must be non-negative and less than length"" -- should contain an assert(index >= 0 && index < getLength());  I'll take care of that.However, esp. in code that got converted from tools' String to OUString (where String::CharAt remains silent about its prerequisites), there may be ""clever"" code that relies on s[s.getLength()] returning null.  That code would now be caught (in --enable-debug builds) at runtime due to the assert, and can be fixed to be less clever and more explicit.(Though that does not necessarily pertain to the code in SelectionBrowseBox.cxx, where it is still unclear whether aField can legitimately be empty.)"

45646,0,"Patch Set 1: Verified; Looks good to me, approvedI think that it is an optimization. It goes though many objects in the ""while(aIterator.IsMore())"" cycle and makes notes which type of fill is used. The b*FillUsed variables are set to true if the given fill type is used and it never goes to false => it does not make sense to check the variables once they all are set to true, such check could not change anything.I think that we could actually end the cycle once both bLineUsed and bAllFillUsed are true. The variables can't change with more iterations :-)anyway, it is great change and I push it"

45662,0,"Patch Set 1:This change is related to columns in text sections, not columns for pages. I guess page columns are not exported to HTML because there is really no generally applicable way of doing that; HTML pages do not have fixed height like pages in Writer do.To test this you need to- Open a new empty Writer document- Choose Insert -> Section- Go to Columns tab and type in a number, 3 for example, click Insert.- now you can see the little grey section markers, paste some long text inside those.- save as HTML, you should end up with a HTML document that has a MULTICOL element that contains the column count both in the old non-standard COLS-attribute and in the new css column-count attribute.PS.

There is no technical reason why anonymous namespaces would be ""better"" than static, and the ""deprecation"" of static was commonly seen as meaningless (because no way were they going to actually remove that feature from the language and break tons of existing, perfectly fine, code), and was later withdrawn."

During initialization the default 'All' value is not sent to OQueryController. So when the content of LimitBox is not changed, the SQL statement will contain a 'LIMIT' keyword without value which cause syntax error (m_sLimit is empty by default).So need some improvement."

Hindi numbersYes, It will be good to get some advice to solve this checking generally.3. grabFocusFromLimitBoxLimitBox sends data to OQueryController just when it loose its focus. So to have recent data for SQL run for example, we have to grab focus from LimitBox.In what situations appears it? For example when a new LibreOffice user try out this feature. He\She is adding new limit values and running to see the result. In this casethere is no effect of adding limit, because with clicking on the run toolbar item the focus is stayed on the LimitBox, so its data is not sent to the right place and not used in the running SQL statment."""

47803,1,"Patch Set 1:Note that in order to approve this patch, I think the following steps are necessary:1) Somebody needs to have an Apple code-signing certificate in their keychain. Or maybe a certificate issued by some other entity would also work, or a self-signed one, I don't know. (I only have experience of handling Apple-provided ones in Xcode.)2) And then do a full ""normal"" (Intel) release build of the 4-0 branch3) And then somebody (else) needs to try the produced dmg on machines running 10.4, 10.5 and 10.6 and check that the app runs fine, that the signed binary doesn't cause problems in an older dynamic linker which doesn't know what the signature stuff inserted into the binary means.Alternatively, if somebody can find a definitive reference that promises signed binaries will work also on 10.[456], I guess we should trust that...(For 10.7 and 10.7 I think it is safe to assume the signing won't cause trouble, and for 10.8 where Gatekeeper is checking for signatures, I have already verified that signing indeed helps to get rid of the scary warning about ""unidentified developer"".)"

47816,0,"Patch Set 1:Thank you for your suggestions, I will change the code (and test it) and submit as patch set 2.All these handy functions as ScRange::Intersects and ScDocument/ScTab::FindAreaPos are hard to find if you don't know where to look for them. And just browsing through the code is nigh impossible ... But I try to learn :)"
47817,0,"Patch Set 1:yes finding those methods is hard, really sometimes given the size of the code its a case of a) someone tells you or b) you come across it while looking at the issue you are trying to fix or c) you came across the code previously ( and managed to remember it )you are doing a great job in anycase, don't dispair, calc is tough nut to crack and you seem to be managing fine. Anyway think we are there with this patch and we should be able to push your next update"
47818,1,"Patch Set 1:Thanks for your supportive message.I try to concentrate on calc and so be able to use what I found out earlier (if indeed I could only remember it).The intersect-check has been changed and works fine, the FindAreaPos is a dead-end (if that's proper English). It stops at hidden columns/rows and continues until it finds a non-empty cell. Imagine a sheet with some data in row 1 and some in row 2 and you wanting to cut row 2 and paste+shift down above row 1. FindAreaPos will check (MAXROW-2)*MAXCOL cells, where only MAXCOL cells need to be checked. But I started looking around in the code and found ScDocument::IsEmptyBlock() and that looks promising. Still building though (slow machine at my work) and I want to test it before submitting the new patch set."

So I set a ""width in chars"" on the edit box to make it wide enough, that way we don't have to worry about measuring things in pixelsObjectTitleNameDialog   - Lets make it resizeable, as above.  - The original had a scrollbar, so added a scrolledwindow to it with always vertically scroll  - For the textview to give it a default height, rather than using pixels I let it take its width by expand to the above edit widget width  - For its height, added a non-translated text buffer with 5 blank lines and tweaked the ctor to set that as its permanent height request  - GtkTextView maps to class VclMultiLineEdit instead of MultiLineEdit. This is a sort of bizarre impossible to know about corner case. But they should be equivalent, so I just changed MultiLineEdit to VclMultiLineEditNameDialog:  - width requests as above  - set name_entry as the mnemonic widget of name_entryMessBox:  - I set the label to be vertically centered for the resizeable caseI've been keeping things as one dialog per .ui file, which as a side effect allows no name collisions between various ""ok"" buttons being called ""ok"", etc, so I split them up like that."

48411,1,"Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisHmm, I am not sure that I like this change. It does not create the formatting entry without any explanation. You were able to edit the unused formatting and add the range later in the past.For example, imagine that you define some formatting, forget to define the range, and press the ""Add"" button. You will not know why the entry was not created. You will need to select everything again and again until you find why it does not work :-)IMHO, the best solution would be to preffil the range with the current selected cell(s). For example, the DataPilot or Chart is created from the current selection by default as well.Hmm, the prefil would be annoying if you lose some older formatting  in the selected cells. In this case, I would prefer to leave the behavior as is and fix it with the error dialog for 4.1. IMHO, the behavior is more annoying with the patch than without it.BTW: I really like the conditional formatting. It is very cool and useful feature. Thanks a lot for the hard work in this area."
48412,1,Patch Set 1:The reason why this change is a good thing is that being able to define conditional formats without ranges and later storing them in ScConditionalFormatList may result in crashes.Calc core always assumes non-empty conditional format ranges because they have to be kept in sync with the cell attribute storage. Inside ScConditionalFormatList::UpdateReference we will additionally delete ScConditionalFormat instances with an empty range. I also added a check to xmlcondformat.cxx that removes all conditional formats that are imported without a range to prevent a crash.The idea is to add for 4.1 an error dialog that makes clear that you either have to define a range or use Cancel. This is however not possible in 4-0 because of the string-freeze.

So I have some idea to this patch.I think it is unneeded to make a new class for this function. The FindbarDispatcher class enables us to catch and work up messages which is belong to findbar, like 'vnd.sun.star.findbar:FocusToFindbar'. (see dispatch method) So i think it would be better to use this method instead of a new class which has only one useful method and a lot of garnish.It's not a point, but I think the code of ""hide findbar"" can be extract to a function to avoid code duplicates."

48603,0,"Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisThanks for your patch submission.The intent of this change is good, but the code needs a bit more polishing in minor details.1) We use BSD bracing style which isif (foo){    ...}else{    ...}rather than if (foo) {    ...} else {    ...}Inconsistency in bracing style affects readability. Let's make it consistent.2) Normally, when branching with an if statement on a boolean conditional, it's best to set the code block for the true condition first, followed by the one for the false condition in the 'else' block.  So in this case it's best to doif (Application::GetSettings().GetLayoutRTL()){    <code for RTL>}else{    <code for non-RTL>}This will make following the logic of the code a teeny bit easier for human brain.3) Last point is that, the only differences between the RTL and non-RTL case is the value of nXOffset (the first line in each block) and the rendering::TextDirection enum value (the last line in each block). Let's just make these values conditional while keeping the rest of the code outside the if statement block. Code duplication done this way is not a very good style. Let's fix that..."

49219,1,"Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1(1 comment)Why not replace EMPTY with 0,0,INT_MAX,INT,MAX and let the remaining algorithm merge it? I'm not sure I understand why we need all these special cases (too much code to handle special cases when the default merging be enough).In fact, I think it'd be better if we remove EMPTY from Core and replace it with 0,0,INT_MAX,INT_MAX or something like that. We'd have a consistent message format, and easier numbers to parse and merge with others. Miklos, what do you think?"
49220,1,"Patch Set 2:As mentioned earlier, there is some value EMPTY provides (easier to debug, easier to drop all tiles). The immediate problem that needs fixing is that when reading EMPTY into 4 ints, they are left uninitialized, and then passed as Rectangle ctor arguments. That needs fixing.Then I have no problem if it's decided that EMPTY causes more problems than it solves, and get rid of it in a separate commit (though where do you draw that ""max"" line? Does INT_MAX cover the bottom of a very large Writer document that has lots of pages in a single part?)Also, I think this should be done on master, and then cherry-picked to cp-5.1, not the other way around."

49355,1,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1(1 comment)The idea to merge the two threads (callback handler and tile rendering) is reasonable, but we should discuss the approach.The starvation you noticed happens because you are using the tile-queue, which is designed for... well, yes, tiles! :)It reorders the messages such that it renders tiles in large blocks first. So with heavy typing the callback messages always end up getting overtaken by tiles, which the queue explicitly favors, thereby starving callback events.So this is one problem with the current implementation. I think the tiles should have its own queue, and callbacks a separate one. The thread that pumps them would process one callback, then one tile-rendering.Another issue with combining these threads is that there will be reduction in performance. This is because before and after rendering a tile there is significant work being done that does *not* execute with the Solar lock. This code (mostly encoding to PNG) is CPU intensive and can run in parallel to other code (even to other rendering calls).Finally, I have submitted my patch (342125b8ea) to fix the missing tiles issue. Should be easier to read than describe it here (it's only +27, -6). It comes with detailed commit log too. So this approach is mostly an optimization to reduce the thread-count, but, as mentioned, we need multiple threads because we have opportunity to parallelize, and merging them will reduce performance (unless benchmark proves otherwise, of course)."
49356,0,"Patch Set 1:Wrt. the starvation - actually that was due to the logging; we have so much debugging stuff that it was blocking considerably when writing to the console, making the queue grow.  Without that, all works fine even with the unmodified TileQueue :-)But I worked on the TileQueue too - it seems unnecessary to do all the priority shuffling when inserting, when the prioritization changes with every view switch, and instead do it only when the tile is requested - which seems to work nicely.Wrt. an own queue for tiles - that is exactly the thing that makes the synchronzation hard, as then it is necessary to synchronize between those 2 queues; which in turn kills all the advantage of 2 queues :-)Wrt. PNG compression; if we want to thread it, then let's thread just the compression - that'll make it local, more maintainable, and we can go with as many threads there as we wish (for just the PNG compression piece of code).Wrt. the 342125b8ea - thanks for that!  Unfortunately that again just adds code :-(Either way, please check https://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/online/log/?h=private/kendy/tilesandcallbacks , I'd really like to get that in...

Also I think most file formats currently dont support this. Finally, for big documents with lots of big images, this would possibly duplicate memory usage.So for now, I would suggest to discuss what is actually wanted and if it realistically can be provided without confusing users too much."

Thanks for catching that :) > for discussion: > stuff from hpp files is api which hardly changes. > to reduce bloat, includes and forward declarations in hpp files > should not appear in regular hxx headers againI prefer not doing this since I think that headers should directly include everything they need, except private headers and some other cases. It's easier to do that instead of keeping track of the includes and forward declarations that each .hpp file has already, especially since there's so many of them, and I don't think that files should rely on that, regardless of how often the API changes. Leaving those includes and forward declarations in also allows someone reading that file later to know everything that it depends on more easily. If a file relies on an include or forward declaration that isn't already in that file, iwyu considers that as an error and will suggest to place it back in. That would make reading its output harder if I decided to rely on any includes present in .hpp files.Also, GCC and Clang can perform what is called the 'multiple-include optimization' as described here: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cppinternals/Guard-Macros.html and http://clang.llvm.org/docs/InternalsManual.html#the-multipleincludeopt-class...and thus, at least for those compilers, removing an include because it's already in an included .hpp file may have no measurable effect on build time."

49566,1,"Patch Set 6: Code-Review+1I have to *strongly* disagree. LibreOffice is unique in its definition of ""offset"" - anyone coming from Microsoft Word or another program is going to expect the behavior I outlined. The old behavior lends no benefit to the user whatsoever, whereas the new behavior does.Also, the ""current"" way of ""starting on a custom page"" is extremely difficult for many users to understand and implement, and is somewhat unreliable in its nature. The main problem is that you wind up with a new empty page at the start of your document.It's a basic principle of software design: if many users are confused, that doesn't mean the documentation needs to be updated, it means the design needs to be updated.Thus, I vote that since the old behavior adds no value to LibreOffice, this patch be reconsidered. Otherwise, a very clear user-oriented case for the old behavior should be made."
49570,1,"Patch Set 6:I would be all right with dropping this feature, in favor of implementing a considerably easier-to-use ""start page on"" feature.However, we have to face the fact that a huge number of users rely on offset for exactly what this feature allowed, and we have even documented the workaround to achieve the exact same end as what I've described. Thus, before I could abandon this, we would need to:- Change or remove the UI for setting the ""offset"". It appears to be used exclusively for what is was not designed for, and not for whatever theoretical use it was designed for. Removing the UI for offset doesn't eliminate the feature, but it prevents its rampant (apparent) misuse.- Remove the ""workaround"" documented to force offset page numbers to overrun the end of the document. Since this is contrary to intended use, we shouldn't be telling users to use offset this way.- Make the means of ""starting on"" a page number VERY VERY clear.All that said, I don't believe it is wise to abandon this revision until all of those changes are made. This problem has been heavily reported and wholly unaddressed for nearly a decade. This fix isn't ideal, but it is considerably closer to expected behavior than the current behavior. Thus, we need to either provide the expected behavior, or adapt this to match how everyone uses it."
49571,0,"Patch Set 6:Oliver, I forgot to mention that, while this fix makes ""Further comments on page <pagefield + n>."" *possible*, it would require the user to go into that particular page number field and set the offset. That matches Microsoft Word's offset behavior. Offset is never globally applied across fields. It is applied manually to individual fields. A footer is just the most common instance (at which point, the one instance of the page number is offset on all footers because of the footer's functionality, not the page number's functionality).Whether we eventually abandon this or not (see immediately prior comment), I'll address your inline comment. Good catch!"

On Windows, because of the lack of gcc, I copy these > files from external (modified a bit with sed).You are asking the wrong question and giving a wrong answer. Given your patch set 36 where you've added generated header dependency files to GIT, I'm even don't know where to start with the explanation why it's wrong thing to do.What the problem are you trying to solve in the last sane patch set 35 of this change?sed failure, trying to substitute stuff in generated .d files, that should be generated by gcc with -MMD option. Check this Paul's explanation on auto-dependency generation in GNU make + gcc combination: [1]. One important thing to understand though, in LO build tool chain, we are abusing the gcc with gcc-wrapper machinery on Windows, to not mess around with all those MSVC project files and having only one integration tool chain for external libraries. That why, as you noticed -MMD cannot be understood by the cl.exe that get invoked by gcc-wrapper in the end.So the correct question to ask on patch set 35 is *not* where and how to get those .d files, but of course why they are needed in the first place and how to disable all this header tracking feature altogether on windows platform.After you are asking the right question, you should already have the 99% of the answer to this question: Before this change, compilation worked on windows platform for FB 2.5 with the same approach. What was changed? Firebord upgrade? Fine. But why it's related?When you invoke the make with -d option, to see what is actually going on, it's telling you that ""sed ... wildcard ..."" is get invoked. Why and from where?grepping on ""wilcard"" line in FB 3 source code, reveals the lines in question in make.rules. Comparing this file with FB 2.5, reveals that there weren't any sed invokation there.So the missing 3 lines in patch 35 to solve sed missing *.d failures in FB 3 are these deleted 3 lines in make.rules (at least on windows platform): [2].* [1] http://make.mad-scientist.net/papers/advanced-auto-dependency-generation* [2] http://paste.openstack.org/show/534815"

50198,1,"Patch Set 3:Caolan, honestly, I do not think this is the right way to go...I do not think that it is good to 'hack' the animatedBitmapExPreparator - which is a by purpose isolated piece of tooling - into parts. It's purpose is to provide all frames of a GIF in one run.The GIF itself is shown and/or played or not. If just shown, the 1st frame will be needed, if played the whole stack will be needed to do so (all extra actions to create on-demand here will just let it stuck in the 1st loop). If not shown, all the stack can be flushed.There may be the case that only the start frame is needed (screenshot/preview), than this should be optimized. The 1st frame of the GIF is available using simple steps, maybe added to the tooling.So I see no value in on-demand creating *single frames* of the stack, besides that I do not see code to flush it if not used. It will just use the same amount of mem when the GIF is shown and played once.My approch would be to create (a) the 1st frame on-demand, (b) the whole stack on-demand if played (not at load time), and (c) find a way to flush the whole stack if not used (timer/usage based, or the owner getting invisible, there are possibilities). The step (a) would already solve the too-much-mem-after-load problem, the others would make it smart."
50199,1,"Patch Set 3:> Caolan, honestly, I do not think this is the right way to go...This is essentially the same thing as the earlier prototype which seemed acceptable. The frames are still created on demand. Its just that in practice I see that on playback sometimes frames are skipped due to timing issues, in which case we need to occasionally ""catch up"" the missing ones. i.e. play 0, 1, 3, 4 skipping 2. so frame 3 renders 2 into the virtualdevice as well as 3 to get the right final bitmap. > If just shown, the > 1st frame will be needed, if played the whole stack will be needed > to do so (all extra actions to create on-demand here will just let > it stuck in the 1st loop). If not shown, all the stack can be > flushed.I think we're getting hung up on the first frame, the first frame gets requested occasionally during the playback of the animated gif (by the preview I think) so it seemed natural to treat that one separately by caching it so as not not affect the shared virtual devices in use by playback of the active sequence. > So I see no value in on-demand creating *single frames* of the > stack, besides that I do not see code to flush it if not used. It > will just use the same amount of mem when the GIF is shown and > played once.As the animation is played each frame is requested in sequence and each frame bitmap is generated and returned, rendered, and forgotten about, so (ignoring the first frame cache) there is only one bitmap in memory at a time. > My approch would be to create (b) the whole stack on-demand if played (not at load time)What I want to avoid though is 382 simultaneous 1920 x 1080 bitmaps.

If the same UNO API is implemented, then most of the table style import/export code can be shared between Writer and Impress in xmloff.> there is no separation between a table and its style in writer core so farThe ""style"" is the autoformat, SwTable::maTableStyleName stores the autoformat of the table, if it has any.> what should this actually return? Even the members in the existing basic XStyle interface like ""isInUse()"" cant be doneI guess it's fairly straightforward to implement it: need to iterate over SwTables, and see if any of them has the autoformat set to the given autoformat.So yes, I agree that table style is different to paragraph/character styles, but given that we have autoformats, it's reasonable to build on top of that, and I think it's fairly possible to provide UNO API, filters, UI building on top of this.

Since you didn't remember filing this bug, if there is something else that you'd want me to work on, please do tell.I would have loved to work on creating MAR files (from onlineupdate module), and still do think that's the best thing to do as it would mean I would get a headstart when it comes to the actual coding period begin dates, and had sent a mail to you regarding that.

The relevant XML from 'content.xml' : <draw:frame draw:name=""Rahmen4"" draw:style-name=""fr2"" svg:x=""70.8379179942pt"" svg:y=""289.1627056658pt"" text:anchor-type=""page"" text:anchor-page-number=""1"" draw:z-index=""6"" svg:width=""496.0638515pt"" svg:height=""14.0882133826pt"">    <draw:text-box fo:min-height=""0.01pt"">     <text:p text:style-name=""P5""><text:bookmark text:name=""Bezugszeichen""/><text:tab text:tab-ref=""1""/>7.

(Miklos - this might be a part answer to your comment)The below explanation is only concerning the Sender Fields and not related to the Bookmark problem.Now looking at the what else is happening in XMLSenderFieldImportContext, we haveaAny <<= nSubType;rPropSet->setPropertyValue(sPropertyFieldSubType, aAny);where nSubType is from UserDataPart - offapi/com/sun/star/text/UserDataPart.idlNow XMLSenderField is of type ""ExtendedUser"" which is defined in offapi/com/sun/star/text/textfield/ExtendedUser.idl'UserDataType' is already present here.The association between 'UserDataType' and 'UserDataPart' is exactly like what I want to create between 'TextFieldType' (which I have defined) and 'Type' from Type.idl mentioned above.So I looked into all the places where changes need to be made.1) The first one is of course in ExtendedUser.idl2) Then there is adding the corresponding entry to offapi/type_reference/offapi.idl. (This was because other entries in ExtendedUser.idl had been declared here too)3)Adding ' #define UNO_NAME_TEXT_FIELD_TYPE ""TextFieldType"" ' to sw/inc/unoprnms.hxx is the most doubtful step where I don't know whether I'm right. Some entries from include/editeng/unonames.hxx have entries in sw/inc/unoprnms.hxx. Some of them are ""CurrentPresentation"", ""IsDate"", etc. So I thought ""TextFieldType"" needed to be in sw/inc/unoprnms.hxx as UNO_NAME_TEXT_FIELD_TYPE so that it can be used in sw/source/core/unocore/unomap.cxx. I haven't looked into adding anything to unomap.cxx yet.4) Then adding ""const OUString sPropertyFieldSubType1;"" to xmloff/inc/txtfldi.hxx is just an emulation of ""const OUString sPropertyFieldSubType;"".5) Similar is the case of adding ""const sal_Char sAPI_text_field_type[]           = ""TextFieldType"";"" to txtfldi.cxx. (A direct emulation of ""const sal_Char sAPI_user_data_type[]            = ""UserDataType"";""Of course, the relevant header files have been added to txtfldi.cxxNow looks like we shoudn't add anything to 'XMLSenderFieldImportContext::StartElement' in txtfldi.cxx as the properties from UserDataPart have been extended as XML Tokens (const short NAME from UserDataPart.idl is used as XML_TOK_TEXT_SENDER_NAME)  and are being used there. At the moment, the properties from Type.idl are not used as XML Tokens. Again I would need help with the decision here as to whether to extend as XML Tokens or not.Finally in XMLSenderFieldImportContext::PrepareField(),using namespace textfield;aAny <<= Type::EXTENDED_TIME;rPropSet->setPropertyValue(sPropertyFieldSubType1, aAny);is what is supposed to be done.Since I've mentioned '[optional, property]long TextFieldType;' as optional in <opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/offapi/com/sun/star/text/textfield/ExtendedUser.idl>, I might need a boolean to indicate when 'setPropertyValue()' must be called for each of the fields from <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/offapi/com/sun/star/text/textfield/Type.idl> in here <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/xmloff/source/text/txtfldi.cxx#706>. I don't think we need to call it for all 15 properties all the time. How do I use the boolean variable - like for example - how do I use it to indicate when to set EXTENDED_TIME and when not to..?And there's one more thing:I think we may need to call this setPropertyValue() <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/editeng/source/uno/unofield.cxx#675> instead of the one currently being called <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sw/source/core/unocore/unofield.cxx#2152> which is throwing up an Unknown Property Exception at <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sw/source/core/unocore/unofield.cxx#2165> One is sw's implementation while the other is editeng's implementation.

50718,1,"Patch Set 1:Could you please elaborate what the ""too many OpenOffice Calc spreadsheets with DDE inside which become unusable after migrating to LibreOffice"" problem is?"
50722,1,Patch Set 1:The users might get confused because they have to make a decision and many of them will not know what DDE links are. But what about the old Calc documents with existing DDE links? When the user wants to add more links he will get a mixture of DDE and File links in the end?
50725,1,"Patch Set 2:To summarize what has been discussed on IRC today:I'm not a big fan of encouraging users to use deprecated and insecure protocols (let's be honest, DDE *is* deprecated and insecure). If this is mainly about inserting links with relative paths, maybe your goals could be achieved by using relative references, i.e. =DDE(""soffice""; ""some/relative/path""; ""SheetX.CellY"")would become ='some/relative/path'#SheetXCellY'and the development effort could be targeted at implementing some UI and clipboard support for relative references and fixing outstanding relative reference issues (sometimes target doc doesn't update if source doc changes, ~/ path doesn't expand correctly etc.)"

50728,1,Patch Set 2:The main argument for us is that our OO Calc users want the DDE links back because LO Calc File links do not work for them: In order to share calc spreadsheets between different users relative paths with 脭脟拢~脭脟脴 are used which is not working with LO Calc File links (yet).

I'm reworking the icons as we speak. Mostly because they're incorrect size now (new Action Bar is taller), and they're Holo gray instead of Material white. And also because SVG versions were missing.Also, we could use optipng, but I think it's not really necessary, since we'd be saving just a couple of KB's, while potentially reducing the quality of the PNG's."

Maybe you can replace the fixed button with a toolbar?That way, the design team can also modify the toolbar afterwards (given the toolbar is defined in an .ui file).About the ""Presentation"" button: I feel that one toolbar with actions for the slide pane is enough - two would use too much height. So I would remove that button.Could you implement these changes? Or, if you have other suggestions, we might discuss it in our design meeting on Friday."

HOWEVER, if we plan to materialize the Viewer/Editor app, it would also have green color, and maybe we should distinct the two. Also, if we switch it to green, we'd need a new icon (I'm working on it, as soon as I get CorelDraw working on Linux).

50894,0,"Patch Set 1:Checked deeper. There is only a single call to BlendBitmap with that many parameters in DrawDeviceAlphaBitmapSlowPath. It uses a helper class called TradScaleContext to create the mappings. That class already tries to use mirroring:        const bool bHMirr = aOutSize.Width() < 0;        const bool bVMirr = aOutSize.Height() < 0;Sidenote: Metric values like Width/Height can be negaitve, currently allowed by the definition of Rectangle. this is by itself not good - better use B2IRange and transformations.Thus, this already applies mirroring to the array (as suggested in last coment). Since bHMirr, bVMirr are calculated the same way this should happen.Thus mirroring gets already applied in the index arrays (as suggested in the last comment). So this patch is more about the 'alignment' of the to-be-blended part relative to the target bitmap. In that case all may be as intended.Still not sure about the indices and if nMapY, nMapX are safe in the call to pA->GetPixelIndex to be in bounds. If not, LO will crash"

50897,1,"Patch Set 1:Hi Pasqual, thanks for having a look.The BitmapRead/WriteAccess methods do assert in debug, but nonetheless then execute with out-of-bound values, esp. in product version this is often the cause of immediate crashes.

If you are just reasonably sure, I would suggest to encapsulate with if(...) statements which guarantee the in-bound access."

I was a bit upset that the headless patch was merged even though the ESC asked the author not to merge it in its current form. The opengl situation on our Android port is a bit unclear. On one hand, we disable opengl in configure, OTOH it seems we build most of the opengl code in vcl. My commit just restored that status quo, fixing the build. I also verified that the build result actually works. :-)Given that at the end Android uses cairo to render the tiles, the opengl code is not useful on Android. However, probably it's a good idea to not work on removing it from the Android binary till it's not clear if those opengl #ifdefs will go away or not in the long run. (Currently we have those ifdefs, but it's possible they will be reverted, it's not clear yet.)"

No need of computation of row heights in report builder.On the other hand, it requires some work in the Report Builder UI to add a user-settable property there in order to allow the user to choose whether the row should, or should not, have automatic height."

51050,1,Patch Set 1:(1 comment)So this is going to be an ugly one.We are now hitting a limitation of the current test framework. Currently all our tests don't have access to the UI configuration as it breaks the tests. Now I don't remember why I went the way of pointing the ui path to the user profile but it still seems to be necessary. Back when I wrote that code there were however no UI files so it was still so that the whole UI should have worked. Now with the UI files this is no longer true and pointing the UI config path to a place that does not the UI files causes an exception and later a crash.I will need some time to get back into the details of the configuration management during the tests.

51402,1,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1(14 comments)First, thanks for the overall performance improvement, the numbers you gave in your mail were quite promising.For my nitpicks see the inline comments ;-)I have one concern though, that we somewhere might miss to set the mbMayHaveFormula flag if there is a formula cell added to the column, which at the end would lead to wrong calculations. Can we somehow make sure that it *always* gets set if a formula cell is present?"
51404,1,Patch Set 5:I'm not sure how you get your numbers. Maybe you are not using a release build.In a release build using the 200 row test case the ScColumn::StartListeners method is responsible for about 7% of the whole calculation time. Nearly none of that is related to std::for_each and nearly everything is related to the expensive calls in that method.
51407,0,"Patch Set 5:Hi KoheiYou were right my builds were not clean and i had some debug code. Sorry for that. I did a full rebuild of the libreoffice project with ./autogen.sh --without-java --without-help --without-myspell-dicts no more --enable-dbgutil  and i hope it is sufficient for enabling optimizations. I made more tests, and the code is still slightly faster (1 to 2%), but i think it is in the error tolerance, and anyways things are really more important than percent... i was talking about saving three seconds over a ten minutes computation. Not really worth it ;)So i will revert to the original code and the functor.Now my question is, do you you have a prefered way to send information between ScColumn::StartListeners and class StartListenersHandler ?My first idea is to add an extra parameters to the constructor, a reference to the column, so it could set the FomulaFlag? How about this ?"
51408,1,"Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1@William:Reading now that the initial performance improvement numbers you gave (in your mail back then) were obtained with a dbgutil build, they were certainly misleading. I tend to believe that the actual improvement in a standard/release build would be much less and would not justify this change, and introducing a still possible risk that presence of a formula cell would go undetected and lead to wrong calculations is a no-go for me."
51409,1,"Patch Set 5:@EikeI fully understand that if the gain is not sufficient, stability prevails. Honestly i am no longer sure if my builds were debug or not... The information i posted were misleading because i switched to debug when i created the performance unit test. I do not remember my september builds.I am currently running a performance test with today's version and release build (./autogen.sh --without-java --without-help --without-myspell-dicts) using the different test case i used, and my original test file. So far the execution ratio is about 1.43 with the 2,000 lines file and about 1,35 with the 5,000 lines file.The performance test with the original file will take hours... so i propose to wait until tomorrow, then i will post more results and tests case you need. So far i have processed about 17% and the current line ratio is about x2. It is a current value, not an average. Average on the first 17% is close to 1.45 but should raise."
51410,1,"Patch Set 5:Hey William,so what I propose is that we take the performance tests that have been pushed already to master and start from a purely algorithmic perspective.I had a short discussion with Eike and Kohei and reading the patch and looking at the results of the performance test I feel that we can easily win much more by doing some algorithm improvements to the subtotal code.If you look at the current callgrind output we are basically inserting n rows and execute the same operations in the code for each inserted row. Most of these operations however are not necessary for n-1 iterations as the only valid update happens in the last iteration. Examples for that are starting and stopping listeners, updating references.Not all of these places are easy to refactor but I think all in all we can find an incremental approach moving to this goal. If you are interested in that let us move the discussion to the mailing list.The huge advantage of that approach is that the code will be simpler and more robust (the boolean flag is easy to forget in the future in some new code path) and will give the same speed up for columns with formula cells as well."

That is close to a 1.75 ratio, and it saved two hours and a half of processing time. Most of the time was spent into the pDocument->InsertRow calls (from table3.cxx ScTable::DoSubTotals). During this night runs, the time spent in this method was ranging from 85.177 to 1089.3 ms with the current code, and from 81.755 to 394.771 ms with the patched code.

51543,0,"Patch Set 4:Some functions seems in need to handle both. I guess we can't change the VBA interface ;-)Now there is INetURLObject(OUString const & rFSysPath, FSysStyle eStyle), so probably we can get rid of osl::FileBase::getFileURLFromSystemPath, if we set eStyle according to the system settings?I also missed the smart parsing functionality. I had a look now, but didn't find code which would just accept system specific local paths, as there seems to be no system setting for FSYS_*, as FSYS_DETECT will - as far as my fast gimplse at the code told me - happily accept file URLs in any system notation, if you pass FSYS_DETECT.And there are a lot more users of osl::FileBase::getFileURLFromSystemPath, which expect a local path right from the start. Some expect to use the input path, if it's correct, while others want the GetMainURL(). But I just found one with a different decoding then NO_DECODE.I can convert everything to smart URL and run make check, but I can't verify all places. We just need to define a FSYS_SYSTEM value somewhere, so we won't accept other system file encodings."

51549,1,"Patch Set 4:So looking at 1d1fd4d2b6ee1db407a8f16dee84900b4f0ff5b2's use of TryUrlFromSystemPathAsString in the SwMailMergeDlg InsertPathHdl (sw/source/ui/envelp/mailmrge.cxx).  The original content of m_pPathED/sPath is either known to be a URL (pModOpt->GetMailingPath(), aPathOpt.GetWorkPath(), xFP->getDirectory()), in which case it is unfortunate that that information was thrown away in the first place.  Or it is some text the user created in m_pPathED.  There is already code in SwMailMergeDlg::ExecQryShell to interpret m_pPathED as a URL, using URIHelper::SmartRel2Abs (so also handling relative paths).  I would stick to that code here, too.It is very rare for the smart-parsing INetURLObject ctor to create an instance with INetProtocol::NotValid, so the  if (INetProtocol::NotValid == aProtocol)in TryUrlFromSystemPathAsString will rarely hit, so when called with bFromURL=false, it will typically return an empty string.  I have no idea what 1d1fd4d2b6ee1db407a8f16dee84900b4f0ff5b2's use of TryUrlFromSystemPathAsString (with bFromURL=false) in SwDBManager::ExecuteFormLetter (sw/source/uibase/dbui/dbmgr.cxx) is supposed to do.Generally, regarding smart parsing, I would not worry too much about FSYS_DETECT being too liberal in accepting foreign filesystem notations---the input it would thus accept would hardly be anything a user could reasonably intend to be something meaningful that should be interpreted differently.  And if there should be any real problems there (but I'm not aware of any), we could probably replace that FSYS_* enumeration with code that just smart-parses the syntax of the given platform.  (A more useful addition to INetURLObject's smart-parsing functionality would likely be a static factory function that, unlike the smart-parsing INetURLObject ctor, does not require the caller to specify a ""smart scheme.""  That would also address the need of adding an INetProtocol::DEFAULT value.)"

51554,1,"Patch Set 6:> So what about all the duplicated code?

INetURLObject is a mess with a long history, and it already has too much functionality to make it easy to pick the right function to call.  Let's not add to that. ;)"

I asked Kadertarlan, to do all other tests first and wait with calc until last...giving a chance to discuss it more, but unfortunately the order was reversed.I have NO intention of doing anything secret or behind anybodys back, but I also do not see it as wrong if someone want to write Python tests and replace the java as long as it does not prevent other future developers from making a C++ version."

Moreover, mpClientWindow member variable of mpBorderWindow points to this window too. So by doing mpBorderWindow.disposeAndClear(), we're effectively ending up calling dispose() on this window recursively. Or so it seems.Unfortunately, I've no immediate remedy or creative idea how to fix the issue once and for all, without causing regressions.

So the toolbar button shouldn't update with the current > color, but instead show the last used one.Uhm, I get the split button part (and I kept it in place), but I'm slightly challenged with what's the desirable behaviour supposed to be otherwise1. Sidebar and toolbar colour buttons don't update each other and at any time, they can contain totally disjunct sets of colours (status quo, almost)2. Sidebar and toolbar colour buttons are in sync, any time colour in sidebar changes, corresponding toolbar button is updated and vice versa3. Sidebar updates toolbar but not the other way round4. Toolbar updates sidebar but not the other way roundI don't want to step over conscious better design decisions, so the new text background colour button needs to follow the same path, whichever of the above it is"
51869,1,"Patch Set 1:Well, for me this is the desired result:1. A simple button (i.e. with ToolBoxItemBits::DROPDOWNONLY bits) should show the current color of the selected text/object.2. A split button (i.e. with ToolBoxItemBits::DROPDOWN bits) should initially show some common color, and later the last used one, for easy re-applying it on another text/object.3. All buttons of the same kind (simple vs split), and that are representing the same text attribute, should be synced, and show the same color, regardless whether they are on the toolbar or on the sidebar.This means that if we have .uno:Color on both the toolbar and the sidebar, and *both* are split buttons, they need to be synced - but with the last used color, not with the current one (i.e. if you move the cursor to a text with a different color, it shouldn't affect the button). That's why SvxColorToolBoxControl::StateChanged has the check for bSidebarType, so split buttons won't be updated with the current color, but keep the last used one. This bSidebarType is simply used for distinguish between simple and split buttons, allowing them to share the same code, it's just poorly named (because most of the buttons in the sidebar are simple buttons - except the ones from the text panel, and all the toolbar buttons are split ones).Now, this scenario of syncing split buttons is not yet implemented (and already reported in tdf#82438). The problem is that the last used color is stored inside PaletteManager, and we have separate instance of it for each visible button. This causes also that the last used color resets after closing and re-opening the toolbar (because SvxColorToolboxControl instances are destroyed together with the toolbar) - see tdf#61868, tdf#71413, tdf#72991, tdf#83789.One possible solution is to turn PaletteManager into a singleton, so we'll have only one instance, and could manage all visible buttons from there. That way we could also sync the ""recent colors"" palette between all visible pickers, and maybe also the currently chosen main palette. Right now each visible button has its own instance of all these settings. Even worse - right now each instance has its own list of all palettes and their colors, thus wasting resources. Such kind of things surely should be managed in a centralized way."

We can add additional value there to indicate buttons that should not be disabled. It can be separated by a semicolon, the same way I did in framework/source/uielement/subtoolbarcontroller.cxx.On the other hand, I'm not sure that such scheme is useful in other cases, so it might be better to simply derive from PopupMenuToolbarController a dedicated class for the save button."

52186,1,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1Basically not a bad approach, but it should be done more modular, e.g. create a primitive class hich has gradient stops and decomposes to the already existing FillGradientPrimitive2D, so nothing has to change there (safe) and the new classes will extend the functionality in the sende of primitives (as intended). This would also avoid the from my POV unacceptable double definition of StartColor/EndColor.In general it can be done to extend all 'classic' gradients to gradient stops (modular), but is questionable - evtl. implementing the SVG gradient definitions and using these if needed would be superiour. This can also be done using primitives and a decomposition, so all renderers would be capable of crunching these."

This has the corresponding attribute svg:offset. It has data type double.Comment regarding color: ODF1.2 allowes <svg:linearGradien>. This has in its <svg:stop> child element the attribute svg:stop-opacity. com::sun::star::util::Color (in GradientStop.idl) can carry this information because it has an alpha channel.

52322,1,"Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1OK - I've read the patch more carefully now...The comment ""/// XStatusListener"" is totally misleading.  Normally it means that the method implements XStatusListener UNO service, which scared me a lot, one has to be very careful introducing this :-) Having read it more carefully, it is not the case here luckily.Generally, please do not mix style changes with functional changes in the patches like this, then it looks like a much more complex change than it really is :-)  Of course it is OK to change the style of the actual lines you are touching, but when you do that for lines around too, it just makes the patch less readable.Also it is good to add comments to the places you are fixing / implementing - at least one line summary of purpose of a class is much appreciated.So I'd suggest the following: Split to more patches, where1) 1st patch turns ButtonStatusListener into VclStatusListener template liketemplate <class T> VclStatusListenerthat gets the widget as the template parameter, and calls its statusChanged() method.  In the toolbar code, the instantiation would look like mpStatusListener  = new WindowStatusListener<ToolBox>(this, "".uno:ImageOrientation"");2) 2nd that actually implements the functionality for the toolbar.3) [optionally] some style clenaup arnoud, but better to avoid doing much of that.Also - is this all that was necessary to be done to fix the problem in the sidebar, or is an additional patch anticipated?Thank you for your work on this! :-) - and sorry about my initial reaction, the stylistic changes + the wrong comment triggered a warning light in my mind ;-)"

Please remove all ""multiple-empty rows chunks""You added multiple empty lines, where one would be sufficient. This happens in functions and between them.2. Please split the refactoring into multiple patchesThe ToNextRecord is the most obvious one but there is more.The whole refactoring is basically not reviewable, as it's too much in a single patch.There is a reason why Gerrit marks this patches size as red.3. Actually set a meaningful subjectProbably start the whole series with ""MM: Refactor ToNextRecord""The refactoring actually has no reference to the bug and is independent, so you don't need the bug-id prefix.4. Think about inline'ing the small functionsThere are GetRowSupplier and GetColumnSupplier, which are just called once and just contain two lines of code.5. Introduce a mail merge state struct to reduce function arguments and stack sizeI literally needed to gasp for air when I saw:+void SwDBManager::MergeSingleFiles(SwDoc *pWorkDoc, SwWrtShell &rWorkShell, SwWrtShell *pTargetShell, SwDoc *pTargetDoc,+                                   SfxObjectShellLock &xWorkDocSh, SfxObjectShellRef xTargetDocShell,+                                   bool bPageStylesWithHeaderFooter, bool bSynchronizedDoc,+                                   OUString &sModifiedStartingPageDesc, OUString &sStartingPageDesc, sal_Int32 nDocNo,+                                   long nStartRow, sal_uInt16 nStartingPageNo, int &targetDocPageCount, const bool bMergeShell,+                                   const SwMergeDescriptor& rMergeDescriptor, sal_Int32 nMaxDumpDocs)This is ridiculous脭脟陋As Katarina already suggested, create a mail merge status structure, i.e. name it SwMergeState (and have a look at SwMergeDescriptor), and pass it around.

52433,1,"AbandonedAfter some check of the native file picker operation, I discovered the reason for the behaviour I observed depends from the WebDAV server in use.It seems that some among them don't implement correctly the escaping of the collection property, e.g. the file name.For the time being I'll abandon this change.A simple work-around can be used to open the file: use the full unescaped file path directly with the full path in the native filepicker dialog box."

The larger > the interface we promise to be stable, the harder to make future > changes.As there are two ways to connect to signals -- First is to connect via g_signal_connect, and the other one would be via these function pointers. We can always use the former, but I think later approach is better and cleaner way of doing things. We can sort-of know the order when the handlers would be called. With function pointers, we can precisely control the point at which the default handlers will be emitted; we can chain up to the parent in our default handler. This is similar to as we have done in lok_doc_view_class_init function for the widget class overriding their key_press_event, key_release_event etc.See: https://developer.gnome.org/gobject/unstable/gobject-Signals.htmlWith g_signal_connect-ed handlers, we would be having no idea which one would be called first.Currently this is not a huge problem; I can always make it work with g_signal_connect in g-d, but it would be cleaner otherwise, and in the long run.Regarding the ABI, yes we can add up as many new signals as up to today, but that leaves us with only one option of connecting to signals i.e g_signal_connect. The `gpointer padding[8]` should be enough and help us to preclude the ABI change."
52521,1,"Patch Set 1:The reason why 8 doesn't seem to be enough is that just in Writer internally (see the RES_MSG enum in sw/inc/hintids.hxx) we have 39 signals, and that does not include shared code, Calc and Draw/Impress. So I would like to keep the possibility to add from these to the widget as/when necessary, without breaking ABI.If we limit the number of new possibilities to 8, the last signal will be a ""something happened"" one, and we'll stuff everything else into that -- sounds like a bad outcome.Maybe let's wait with this till there is a user for which not having the function pointers is really a hard problem."

You get the sme with a quick git grep or even opening the source file and looking at the declaration of the tests.It would be the same as printing the source line of the test declaration in a CPPUNIT_TEST macro instead of the source line of the assert that failed.

But from observation, I noticed that cpu utilization is low during external project builds and peaks during the LO code build.Is it possible to get more accurate numbers from the build machines with this enabled (and compare to when it wasn't) ?"
52553,1,"Patch Set 1:IMHO a much better way to improve CPU utilization, without overcommitting, would be to relax the dependencies on external projects a bit. A dependency of a library on external project is typically added by calling gb_LinkTarget_use_external_project; the current impl. delays building of any source file of the library until the external project is done, which is not necessary unless the external project generates a (public) header during build. This could be changed to depend only on the unpacked tarball and only the link target itself on the external project, possibly with a second argument forcing all to depend on the full external project (I do not know if this would be actually needed. A test build would show.)"

However, as mentioned in IRC the same could be accomplished with some formulas like unichar()."

52606,0,"Patch Set 2:Thanks for the quick review Markus.GetString() / EnterData() just working with the ""visual contents"" should be fine for the intention of alt-X.  It wouldn't make much sense to ""Unicode toggle"" the last characters of a formula (there is a separate patch that handles Unicode Toggle AS YOU ARE ENTERING DATA in case you are trying to generate a single Unicode character).  Because I use the value, this allows someone to quickly generate a table of numbers using a formula, and then simply convert that table into the Unicode equivalent characters.  Yes, that would ""lose"" the formula.  I think that would be the expected result for anyone using this feature."
52607,1,Patch Set 2:Thinking a bit about it I'm not sure if that works without problems.Some cases that seem like they are causing issues (beside the undo handling):* protected cell ranges* array formulas* formulas in general (here you'd be able to argue that it is not an issue)* edit engine cellsSo I think there are a few more issues with that code than is obvious in the beginning. At least the array formula and the protected cell problem are serious problems that need to be handled before that patch can be merged. Also I'd like to see the undo being handled correctly.
52608,1,"Patch Set 2:Hi Markus,I updated my test spreadsheet to include your extra tests conditions.  It seems like EnterData() already handles the items you were concerned about.protected cell ranges:  ""Protected cells cannot be modified"" pops up when it tries to change the protected cell.  It continues and finishes the whole range, skipping only the protected cells.array formulas: ""You cannot change only part of an array"".edit engine cells:  not sure what you are referring to here.  If you mean that the cursor is in a single cell (or in the top view), then this Execute() function doesn't seem to be called in that circumstance. Did you notice that I updated the code to treat everything as a single Undo?  I copied the code I found in cells1.cxx.  Is there still more that you think needs to be done?  I used the string ""multiple.operations"" since it seems to fit well.  This function is obscure enough that it does not warrant a translation requirement for a string something like undo ""Unicode Notation Toggle""."

I didn't find example code to copy related to acting on each cell of a multi-range selection.  Undo has been a reviewers concern of late.  Perhaps if it is simple to group all the changes into a single undo that would be a good addition.  Currently each cell can be individually 脭脟拢undone脭脟脴, which is fine with me.  I don't think it is worth extra effort if the code is complicated, or if it involves a translation effort.

52816,1,Patch Set 1:I'm unhappy about the default constructor which does not represent a OpenGL resource.I understand that it is necessary to implement the change which is why I'm not happy with the general change.Additionally I think you should still use a mp prefix as the object is still a (smart) pointer.

The decision was made, among other reasons perhaps, on the basis that it was a more malleable icon theme (with sources available and compatible with our license) which we could modify to suit our needs. This is still a big advantage that would be lost if we switched to Galaxy in the platform with the most of our user base.

StartTLS: SMTP + EHLO, check for STARTTLS and establish TLS (normally on port 25 or 587) 2. SSL/TLS: SMTP_S_ without STARTTLS (normally on port 465). This should directly start encrypted (SMTP_SSL)! 3. Insecure: SMTP (as 1.)The ports are just the well known ports, but servers can run on any.In the case of the SSL setting from LO, I would just probe 1 and 2 and skip 3.

When reading a git log, it is useful to have a few details on the rationale behind a change: what problem are you solving, what approach you脭脟脰ve followed to fix it, etc. Examples of good commit messages are in Poedit脭脟脰s repo, this is a random example: https://github.com/vslavik/poedit/commit/d6af8b16f386c92af4ad3107346990a57d92d4c5(Of course, you don脭脟脰t have to write novels out of commit messages, but most of the time a few explaining sentences are prefectly fine.)2. We have just (like a few days ago!) migrated to our own instance of Bugzilla (we used FreeDesktop.org脭脟脰s one before), so thw way we refer to bugs has changed: instead of using the abbreviation 脭脟拢fdo#脭脟脴 we now use 脭脟拢tdf#脭脟脴.Thanks again your your submission!"

54275,1,"Patch Set 2:Thanks for your review, David.First of all, i was wrong in the commit message. I should have written 'GetDenominator()==0'About if it is necessary or not.. i think that it is not immediately necessary.I identify three usages of invalid fractions:a) the fraction is created with Fraction(long nNum, long nDen). This allow create a fraction with zero denominator.b) the fraction is created with Fraction(double dVal). This allow the creation of invalid fraction if dVal is out of a long range, in which case the numerator is set to zero and the denominator is set to -1.c) if at least one of the operands in an operation is invalid, or if the result of an operation with valid operands is out of a long range, the result is an invalid fraction with numerator set to zero and denominator set to -1.In some pieces of the code i see conditions using GetDenominator()==0, which are false if we check against invalid fraction due ""overflow"" (cases b) and c)), but true against GetDenominator()==1.In my previous commit, 2ce0aededea43231d91a0955fc0676120dcc4f13, i missed the case 'divide by zero' or 'zero denominator'. In that commit we catch a division by zero when initialize a Fraction as an invalid value due ""overflow"".I think that we can do the following:a) revert the commit 2ce0aededea43231d91a0955fc0676120dcc4f13 and try a best effort in rewrite the Fraction classb) add two invalid cases in the Fraction implementation rewrite: ""overflow"" and ""divide by zero"", then we can rewrite the conditions such ""GetDenominator()==0"" as ""IsDivideByZero()"" (this patch)c) rewrite the conditions such ""GetDenominator()==0"" as ""!IsValid()"", but that can modify the usage of Fraction values, due that in some cases, in the if block of GetDenominator()==0 i'm see usages of GetNumerator(). An example is include/svx/svdtrans.hxx in ResizePoint: if (xFact.GetDenominator()==0) xFact=Fraction(xFact.GetNumerator(),1); // DivZero abfangenI'm waiting for your commentsGreetings"
54277,1,"Patch Set 2:The include/svx/svdtrans.hxx example is not very convincing to me. IMHO the a/0 -> a/1 change just replaces one meaningless value by another meaningless value. It would be equally good (or bad) to use 1/1... Also, this code does not handle the overflow case ."

It saves the time of searching primitive in a map.It seems more effective to store primitive data like that and so we can use the same algorithm for simple models too (code would be more simple).

54545,1,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1So, Markus and I had the same discussion years ago.  The reason why we still keep auto_ptr there was 2 things: 1) make the code exception safe, and 2) ptr_set requires auto_ptr to be passed to be truly exception safe.  2) is a loose requirement and you can also pass a raw pointer to ptr_set (as you noticed).  But your current change is a step backward in terms of 1).The best strategy for this use case is to use o3tl::heap_ptr to replace auto_ptr, and call heap_ptr's release() when passing it to ptr_set.  Then the code remains exception safe and we can get rid of auto_ptr."
54550,1,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-2I don't really like that solution, as it would codify in the stable URE interface that on non-Windows wchar_t is 32-bit and represents UTF-32 code units, which need not hold in general.  (Also, include files that are part of the stable URE interface must not depend on Boost, but that would be a minor issue to fix.)

54551,1,"Patch Set 1:> codify in UR that on non-Windows wchar_t is 32-bit and represents UTF-32 code unitsWell, that's an implementation ""bug"". When LibreOffice is ported to a platform where it is not the case, the implementation can be updated for this platform. Or we could implement this function in a more portable way, for example using iconv (but polishing the code to fix the memory leak and all that):static iconv_t cnv = iconv_open(""UTF-16"", ""WCHAR_T"");sal_Unicode *buf=calloc(len, 2*sizeof(sal_Unicode))size_t cnvlen =  sizeof(2*sal_Unicode*len)const size_t cps = iconv(cnv, &str, &len, &buf, &cnvlen)rtl_uStringbuffer_insert( &pData, &nCapacity, getLength(), buf, cps );I actually think implementing this feature in a robust way it would be a service to C++ extensions (even if it does not get used much within LibreOffice).As far as the needs of connectivity/odbc are concerned, I'm happy with the solution suggested by email."

54951,1,"Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1(2 comments)Hi Yogesh.See inline comments for why I think this change is not correct.  It may seem to have fixed the problem with this document but it will introduce issues for other cases.I believe the one-line change that I proposed in https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/10291 is the proper fix.  From your last comment it sounds like you feel it is incomplete, but it does solve both the missing <w:titlePg/> flag and the missing <w:footerReference w:type=""first"">.  In the commit message I tried to explain how the footer spacing import issue triggers this export problem."
54954,1,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1(1 comment)Hi Yogesh, thanks for looking into this.I was worried about the change to wrtw8sty.cxx so I had a bit of a look at the bug myself to understand it better.  I found two different issues which contribute:- the import from docx appears to have a bug which is at play here: when I open the docx in LibreOffice I see that the first page footer has wrong spacing. This affects the export code which tries to join chained page styles into a single word section if they match.  The import bug means that they do not match, so it will try to export this as two different word sections.- however some code recently added to ww8/ww8atr.cxx in a31fbb53dba7 prevents the output of a new section at the page break in this case, as the paragraph on the first page is empty             if( isTextNodeEmpty )                bNewPageDesc = false;So I think these are the two issues that need to be addressed, rather than the change proposed in this item.  Fixing either one of them will solve the reported issue for this document, but it would be great to fix both."

54965,1,"Patch Set 1:Markus,I have not looked at xls, nor at specific binary filter routines, but at the code in general.I have two reasons:1. the pre-patched code consists of a mix of sal_uInt8 and sal_uInt16;2. from previous bug fixes I remember the advise to use size_t for size() types.If it is important to ascertain that the size does not exceed the xls limit, either all types should be sal_uInt8 or a specific check should be added. I would prefer the last option and not 'count' on overflow errors.Finally, as I don't want to mix this change with the fdo40835 patch, I submitted this as a separate patch."
54966,0,Patch Set 1:The advise to use size_t is correct for common code but there are a few differences when dealing with binary formats.It is much more important to pay attention to the size of the types and we had in the past problems with refactorings silently introducing bugs when they changed the type.I think it makes more sense to keep the sal_uInt8 and if really necessary (I'm not sure that more than potentially an assert is neccessary right now) add a check in one central place.The two places that use sal_uInt16 look fine to me as they are like that to make the casting explicit.So all in all I don't see a reason why we would need to change anything in that piece of code right now.

That aMustEncodeMap is used centrally in INetURLObject for all the different URI schemas, and "";"" does have syntactical significance within path segments in general (e.g., in ftp URLs).

The VML spec (鈹?19.1.2.19) says that this is an additional optional identifier, i.e. it doesn't say anything what's the purpose of this attribute.Based on that, handling this via InteropGrabBag sounds like a better option to me: but even if we do it as a normal property, then I think you misunderstood the meaning of ""o"" in ""o:spid"" -- ""o"" refers to ""office"" there, not ""original"".(And needless to say, either please also update the ODF filters if not going witth InteropGrabBag or at least state in the commit message that you plan to update them in the next commit.)"

Anyone qualified enough to write C++ in LO won't find that function a real stumbling block. I think these sorts of mechanical changes should have a goal in mind, like moving towards a new string class or something.

Removing the border from such cell effectively removes the outer border of the previous range.Third, the Undo handling looks dubious to me.But, I'll leave all to Moggi now ;-)"

56116,1,"Patch Set 2:Patch set 2 is 'work in progress', well not so much progress at the moment ;)Notes:1. _ODF functions are saved as _ODF. FormulaCompiler::CreateStringFromToken() is not only called when saving to file, so using that function to rename _ODF functions, will rename them in the UI as well (and behave like non-_ODF function).2. when reading file, FormulaCompiler::Factor() also renames functions in qa and unit tests, giving unwanted and unjust exceptions.3. I changed behaviour of CEILING and FLOOR as I found out that CEILING(1.3;;) was accepted by MustHaveParamCount( nParamCount, 2, 3 ) in ScCeiling() resp. ScFloor(). Now empty is not translated to 0 (when this setting is enabled), but I think this should be done as preparation for the ODF1.2 compliant CEILING/FLOOR functions."

56154,1,"Patch Set 1: This need some tweaks before it is mergedWhile the code looks ok from a first glance (I didn't verify yet) it will not solve the problem. The IANA language tag registry does not define default scripts for languages, it only defines suppress-script for a few. For all other languages you'd still not get the script. See instdir/share/liblangtag/language-subtag-registry.xmlFurthermore, we avoid at all costs to pull in liblangtag if not necessary (hence all the internal handling of known tags in canonicalize()) because (despite that the rsc resource compiler can't use liblangtag) it needs a significant amount of time to initialize its data, which at startup would add ~10% of startup time. If VCL needed liblangtag already just to display some glyphs that would be a heavy drawback.My suggestion to solve this would be to add an extra default script field in i18nlangtag/source/isolang/isolang.cxx to aImplIsoLangEntries and aImplBcp47CountryEntries and change the lang::Locale returns of MsLangId::Conversion::*() methods to a struct of Locale and additionally a Script field. They are used only internally by LanguageTag and not part of a public API so that would be no problem. Of course doing so would need quite some changes and finding all default scripts for all known locales would be a lot of investigation work."

56575,1,"Patch Set 1: (4 inline comments)1) IMHO the negative year fix should go in independently of the time zone issue.3) Why should DateTimeRange contain only one time zone, as opposed to one for   the start value and one for the end value?3) You add time zone information to dates. I don't know the meaning of that.   What would it mean, how would it behave, what would it be used for?   For example, naively, one would think that combining a date with a time,   one would get a datetime. How does one get a datetime by combining   2003-05-17+05 with 23:00-06?   FWIW, SQL does not define a DATE WITH TIME ZONE type.4) I have my doubts about time-zoned time without a date.   How do you convert 20:00+00 to time zone +10?   Just ""wrap around"" modulo 24, i.e. make it 06:00+10?   If you answer yes to that question (that is, always compute modulo 24),   then what is the difference between 06:00+11 and 06:00-13?   The difference only makes sense if one speaks of dates...   Which says that timezones don't make sense unless we know at what date   to apply them.   FWIW, SQL defines a TIME WITH TIME ZONE TYPE, *but* here's what   the PostgreSQL documentation has to say about it:   The type time with time zone is defined by the SQL standard, but the definition exhibits properties which lead to questionable usefulness. In most cases, a combination of date, time, timestamp without time zone, and timestamp with time zone should provide a complete range of date/time functionality required by any application.   (...) we recommend using date/time types that contain both date and time when using time zones. We do not recommend using the type time with time zone (though it is supported by PostgreSQL for legacy applications and for compliance with the SQL standard).I have half a mind to add timezone *only* to DateTime and DateTimeRange,not to Date and not to Time. Note that this would more-or-less eliminateall conversion problems, and ""unlock"" the scenario ""don't add timezoneto structs, but convert everything to UTC"", since conversion of datetimevalues across timezones is AFAIK well-defined. ""Convert everything to UTC""is SQL's behaviour; in SQL all non-timezoned values are assumed to be atlocal time and a date is converted to the timestamp ""same date at time 00:00"".Alternative approach to your ""isTimezoned"": have a separate struct ""DateTimeTZ""?Your ""isTimezoned"" flag should IMHO be called ""isUTC"".Do we actually *need* *any* ""unknown timezone / local timezone"" value in memory?We could just make some assumption (UTC or local TZ) on import/parse/readand store only UTC in memory. Oh, but it would be convenient for our APIs to havethe capacity to take implicitly-localTZ values, yes.If we go the ""assume that values without explicit time zone are in local time"" route,then that flag should be called ""isUTC"".So, I've spoken of what SQL does as a reference;https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/LibreOffice4#Changes_deferred_until_4.1mentions XMLSchema-2. Let's see what it does for another reference: - It (optionally) timezones everything: date, time and datetime. - I don't see a datetimerange in it. - It understands a date as a 24-hour interval   (a DateTimeRange, from date 00:00:00.00000000 to 23:59:59.999999999 for most days,    that is except for leap seconds),    while SQL seems to consider it more like an instant, time 00:00 at that day. - A value without timezone is ""unknown timezone"" and not comparable   to a value with timezone, but on the other hand, section 3.2.7 also calls   untimezoned values ""local values"", which supports the idea that they are   ""local time"". But ""local time"" is unspecified in an interchange file format,   because the file may move from one timezone to the other.   In SQL, everything is convertible/comparable because each session has an   active ""local timezone"" which is used for all untimezoned values.Pragmatically, how close to XMLSchema-2 do we need to be?1) Is there any part of ODF/OOXML/any other format where we need to import   or export a date with timezone?2) Is there any part of ODF/OOXML/any other format where we need to import   or export a time (*not* datetime) with timezone?3) Is there any part of ODF/OOXML/any other format where there can be a   datetime with timezone OR a datetime without timezone and the difference   has some semantic significance (other than ""interpret value without   timezone in this timezone"").4) Is there any part of ODF/OOXML/any other format where we need to import   or export a datetime value without timezone and preserve unmodified as   without timezone?   The kind of scenario I'm thinking of is:   We read a datetime value without timezone from some file, and the file   does not give a context that tells us what time zone to interpret that in,   the user changes stuff, but not the part with that datetime value,   *and* when saving the file again, we need to write back the same value,   as opposed to say the UTC value of that datetime-in-local-timezone   or the same datetime value with local-timezone affixed.5) Is there any part of ODF/OOXML/any other format where we need to import   or export a datetime value without timezone, do changes on it and preserve   it as without timezone?   The kind of scenario I'm thinking of is:   We read a datetime value without timezone from some file, and the file   does not give a context that tells us what time zone to interpret that in,   the user e.g. tells us ""add one hour to that datetime value"",   *and* when saving the file again, we need to write back the new value   as untimezoned, as opposed to say the UTC value of that   datetime-in-local-timezone or the same datetime value with local-timezone   affixed."

If we reallyare to consider that a time is a value in timeline quotiented by 24h interval(that is a representative of the equivalence class ""all moments in the timelineseparated by 24h intervals), then we have no reason to allow (for the timezonevalue) anything overlapping. Your code currently says everything has to bebetween -840 and +840 inclusive. With this interpretation, we should makeone of the following choices: - timezone between -719 and +720 - timezone between -720 and +719 - timezone between 0 and 1439That's the logical conclusion of the interpretation you propose.What I had in mind was another interpretation (which I thinkis consistent with the SQL standard's behaviour): - a timezone region is a part of the earth surface, politically   defined, that has the same time (offset to UTC); that is   calendars and clocks agree all across this zone).   (Many specific points on the surface of the globe hop from    one timezone to another twice a year.) - a datetime is a moment in time in some timezone region. - a datetime is made of two parts, namely a date and a time. - the timezone is attached to the time part of datetime.In this interpretation, the timezone value between -840 and +840refers to a region of earth. Given two timezone regions, whetherclocks agree between these two timezones is a valid question,but not the only one and besides the point for data encoding;they are different timezone regions. E.g. timezone region +660(+11 hours) and timezone region -780 (-13 hours). Clocks agreeacross these two timezones, but calendars don't, so they aredifferent timezone regions where clocks just happen to agree.We could make the following valid choice / observation:XMLSchema-2 has fucked up semantics on time / date / ...,but for adherence to standards and interoperability, we""need"" to adhere to it rather than doing something morecorrect.>> Is there any part of ODF/OOXML/any other format where we>> need to import or export a date with timezone?>> dunno about OOXMLThen bring (one of) our resident expert(s) in this discussion.> (...) ODF at least has numerous attributes of type date.> it says nothing about time zones so by referencing the XMLSchema-2> types they are allowed _everywhere_ a non-time-zoned date is allowed.So basically you are saying our hands are tied, we need to cover everythingXMLSchema-2 allows. Taking your word on that, further discussion on thefollowing points is pointless, we need - timezoned date in the range -840 to +840 - timezoned time in the range -840 to +840 - timezoned datetime in the range -840 to +840 - untimezoned date, time and datetime. - Base will have to map these concepts to the   SQL world to the best of possibilities. E.g., ignore   (drop) the timezone on timezoned dates, or   throw an exception when given a timezoned date   (require only untimezoned date).The remaining decision to be made is whether the UNO structsshould encode the timezone explicitly or be ""all timezoned valuesare in UTC time"". The issue is muddled a bit because the UNOstructs are both our internal working structures and our ""external""(scripting) API date types. I'll discuss the two uses separately.I'm really torn on this issue. Seeing LibreOffice as a programmingplatform, the UNO structs are the data types of our ""standardlibrary"". By putting explicit timezone in the structs, we makethe programmer's life easier because (s)he does not have todeal with converting to UTC before making an API call. We alsomake hir life more difficult because (s)he has to deal with non-UTCtime for each *result* of an API call.Here's what I would consider optimal: - All our (date)time API calls take and return UTC (date)time or   untimezoned (date)time. That is, our (date)time structure   does not have a timezone in it. It is UTC or untimezoned. - We provide a UNO service that provides utility functions that   1) convert between timezoned (date)time on the one hand       and untimezoned time in a caller-provided timezone on       the other hand (*two* incoming arguments: a (date)time       *and* an offset to UTC).   2) convert between timezoned (date)time on the one hand       and untimezoned time in local timezone on the other hand       (*one* incoming argument: a (date)time). - Hmm... As an alternative / complement to the above service,   the (date)time struct constructors takes an optional argument   that says ""the values I'm giving are UTC / localtime / untimezoned""   (we add a new enum with these three values), and the constructor   makes the appropriate localtime->UTC conversion.   Can we do that in UNO? I'm unsure. Actually, I don't expect so.The spanner in the works, and the reason I'm torn, is timezoned dates.They don't fit the above schema. I hate them. For timezoned dates,we *have* to include an explicit timezone in the struct, or expect thatcode will store timezoned dates as a pair of values (a date and anoffset) - bleh. This gives us an inconsistent interface between dateon one hand and (date)time on the other hand.So, the choice boils down to: - inconsistent, but best for (date)time: use UTC for timezoned data.   explicit timezone for timezoned date. - consistent, but unnecessarily annoying for (date)time: add explicit   timezone everywhere. Provide a UNO service that answers the   question ""is this the same point in time""? (that is, semantic equality)Do we *really* *really* need timezoned dates, or are they a bugin the ODF specification?Now, I turn to our internal use. IMHO, untimezoned values should justbe incomparable to timezoned values. Throw an error if it comes up.The user of the values should ""know"" / decide what to do: - strip / discard timezone - convert to/from localtime - convert to/from UTC time - throw an error - ...In particular, different file formats may have different requirements.Different parts of code may have different requirements. Don't forceanything on them. Provide utility functions to do the conversion andthat's it.Having *two* sets of structs (one for timezoned and one for untimezoned)has the advantage that nobody will ""naively"" try to compare them...IMHO it fits this model better. No need to introduce an exception for""incomparable date/time/datetime value"" and no need to handlethat exception everywhere."

56589,1,"Patch Set 2:I don't think it makes sense for the DateTimeWithTimezone struct's DateTimeInTZ member to have the possibility of having different IsTimeZoned values.What about:1) DateTimeBase (or RawDateTime?) -> a copy of the current DateTime: NanoSeconds, Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Day, Month, Year2) DateTime: derives from DateTimeBase, adds IsTimeZoned bool member.3) DateTimeWithTimezone has a ""DateTimeBase DateTimeInTZ;"" member and a ""short TimeZone;"" member.I've thought long and hard about the ""store in UTC"" vs ""store in localtime"" issue.IMO, ""store in UTC"" is preferable:1) It aligns our API with what (AFAIK) most APIs do.2) Since our ""store in localtime"" is really ""store in what was the local timezone at the moment that LibreOffice started"", and not ""store in what the OS tells you is the local timezone right now"", we need to tell our users (programmers/scripters using our API) to use _LibreOffice's_ notion of localtime (that is, offset to UTC that defines localtime), rather than the system one's (and provide a UNO service that provides the offset). I'm rather worried about creeping bugs in the whole LibreOffice/extension ecosystem where scripts / extensions will blindly copy a UNO DateTime into a system structure (such as e.g. in Python a time.struct_time) and pass it to a library expecting local time (such as Python's time.mktime), and get (sometimes) wrong results.This is a concern ""only"" in long-running processes (or more precisely, processes that keep running across a DST change, the computer travelling, etc), but IMO there are several legitimate scenarios where this happens: - People that (like me) leave their computer on in the night with stuff left for the next day still open - LibreOffice quickstarter on Windows, probably? - A LibreOffice process running on a server (with --headless), and other programs / scripts connect to it through URP - laptops & pocket computers (e.g. smartphones, tablets, ...) put to hibernation before travel by plane and woken thereafter3) More generally, ""store in startup locatime"" forces our users to deal with a *third* timezone; they already have to deal with UTC and with localtime-as-understood-by-system, now we introduce them a different timezone that is nearly, but not quite the same as the latter, namely localtime-as-understood-by-UNO.4) ""store in startup localtime"" makes (serialisation of) our UNO DateTime struct NOT SUITABLE for interchange, EVEN ON THE SAME MACHINE.What problem were you trying to solve by advocating ""store in localtime""? From your email:1) (...) VCL does not have a DateTime widget, but a DateField and a TimeField (...) cannot transparently convert from UTC to local timezone, because they would need both date+time to do that.Well, yes. As I understand things, these widgets only deal (and until they are changed, *can* *only* deal) with Time values with IsTimeZoned==false. If some other code reads their Value property, it is then that code's responsibility to interpret that as in a specific timezone.One could argue that since legacy code will generally blissfully ignore the IsTimeZoned member, it gives better backwards compatibility. This assumes that older OO.org/LibreOffice usually served local time in css.util.(Date)Time, which is not obvious to me. It seems to be the case in *some* places, but not in others, so we need a general cleanup anyway. OOXMLDocPropHandler::GetDateTimeFromW3CDTF is an example of a codepath that puts UTC in a UNO DateTime.Any other reason for ""store in startup-time localtime""?"

It depends what you call ""timezone"". If it is something like ""Europe/Amsterdam"", that is ""the time in Amsterdam"", then yes, DST matters. But here, the notion of timezone is just an offset from UTC. That is, we consider that Amsterdam *changes* timezone twice per year. In this case, sure, we can freely / safely convert, we just have to subtract the offset."

But, I'd not even call that""startup-time localtime"" because calculations of offsets may always beinfluenced by the *current* local timezone and DST. I'd rather call it""wallclock time"" because Time/DateTime fields and cell values so farcontain a time not bound to any region. Setting/getting those via UNOAPI always assumed that. Reading/writing ODF assumes it. Passing an UTCtime with IsTimeZoned=true will make existing unchanged code assume theUTC time to be wallclock time instead.To me the IsTimeZoned member doesn't make much sense other than if it isset to false. The application does not know the actual offset, no matterif we define a) true==local_time_with_timezone or b)true==UTC_with_timezone, it will always use the current offsetusing/displaying different values in different timezones for b) orcalculating different UTC for a).

56596,1,"Patch Set 3:>> Any other reason for ""store in startup-time localtime""? > Document persistence and API compatibility I'm not sure I understand what you mean by ""document persistence"". As soon as the document is saved to file, it survives the LibreOffice process that created it, which is how I understand ""persistence"" in a computer science context. If the file format asks for a local time to be saved, the file format filter can do the conversion from UTC or from ""startup-time localtime""; I have more faith in conversion from UTC, because if some code fails to do it, the bug will be obvious / immediate (to the vast majority of the world). By contrast, if some code fails to convert from ""startup-time localtime"", the actual occurrence of the bug will be quite rare and, and the bug can survive for a loooong time in our codebase (or in the code of a user of our API). As to API compatibility, well we are, by design, doing an incompatible API change here. Yes, for our internal code, we will need to convert / adapt code that *gets* a value before code that *gives* a value starts serving values with isTimeZoned==true. > To me the IsTimeZoned member doesn't make much sense other > than if it is set to false. To me, IsTimeZoned==true and IsTimeZoned==false are, in the abstract, two different data types. We stick them in the same UNO struct because it gives a smoother conversion / upgrade path, where we don't have to change the UNO struct/type in various places as we clean up the codebase. IsTimeZoned==true refers to a moment in the ""global timeline"" of Newtonian physics. We could encode it as Gregorian calendar / hour/minute/second UTC, we could encode it as martian days or as Neptune years, we could encode it in the Islamic calendar, in the Solar Hijri (Iran & Afghanistan), it the calendar of the Mayas; in the abstract it does not matter as long as each unique moment in time (up to a certain resolution) has its unique representation and vice-versa. IsTimeZoned==false refers to a Gregorian calendar / hours / minutes / seconds without pinning it on the global timeline; it is the datatype of the Gregorian calendar. (which by pure chance can also be ""recycled"" to be used for the Julian, Islamic and Solar Hijri calendars, but not e.g. for the Jewish or Maya calendar). > The application does not know the actual offset, no matter if we define > a) true==local_time_with_timezone or > b) true==UTC_with_timezone, > it will always use the current offset using/displaying different values in different > timezones for b) or calculating different UTC for a). Well, to be coherent, in the ""a)"" case, the application has to use the g_nTimeZoneOffset introduced in sax/source/tools/converter.cxx, and not whatever the current system offset is. If it wants to display a time in the current local/system timezone to the user, it will have to apply g_nTimeZoneOffset and *then* apply the current system offset. For our users (programmers using our API), we have to expose it in UNO. My worry, which seems to match yours, is that people (programmers) will, by and large, fail to do this properly and just use the current system offset instead of g_nTimeZoneOffset. Which makes ""b"" preferable, and my understanding is you agree: > For only this reason b) would be better because the actual used value would be > UTC converted to current local time. But then, if that is wanted, why not use > DateTimeWithTimeZone and TimeZone=0 ? Because DateTimeWithTimeZone is not a canonical (standard / normal) datatype for ""a moment in the global timeline"": It has several representations for the same moment in time, through the use of different TimeZone values. It is like storing the year as two integers instead of one integer: struct nonCanonDateTime{    int Year; // year    int Epoch; // Gregorian year chosen as year 0; Year+Epoch == Gregorian Year    unsigned int Month;    unsigned int Day;    unsigned int Hour;    unsigned int Minute; } Where the 14:55 on 5 October 1994 can be represented as: - Minute=55, Hour=14, Day=5, Month=11, Epoch=1238; Year=756; - Minute=55, Hour=14, Day=5, Month=11, Epoch=-722; Year=2716; - Minute=55, Hour=14, Day=5, Month=11, Epoch=0; Year=1994;   (Jesus Christ-based calendar) - Minute=55, Hour=14, Day=5, Month=11, Epoch=622; Year=1372;   (Muhammad Hijra-based calendar) - Minute=55, Hour=14, Day=5, Month=11, Epoch=-3761; Year=5755;   (Jewish ""Annu Mundi""-based calendar) It would be just as ""possible"" to use this representation, storing a year and an offset to ""standard year"". But it would be a bad choice, because it encodes a denormalised form of ""moment in time"". Using DateTimeWithTimeZone for ""moment in time"" has exactly the same flaw: denormalised form. For the same reasons that we normalise ""009"" and ""09"" and ""9"" to the same normal (canonical / standard) bitpattern 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001 0001 or (depending on platform) 0001 0001 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 when reading it from file, we should normalise ""moment in time"" to a normal/canonical value."

Work is in progress.But I dislike the idea of a popup because that would mean to block the user with a question any time he pastes on selection. You said you were confused (or at least, you were confused) that when pasting from draw results in an overwrite while pasting from writer removes the selection first. That is the idea which was build in before that the program THINKS FOR YOU, because you perhaps dont want to overwrite when pasting from the same program but you perhaps want to. But programs should not think because they are stupid, and if they are thinking based on wrong assumptions they are seen as doing erratic behavior. There HAS to be another menu point that explicitly offers you that option. Even if I have to hide it in some sub-menu. I am going to finish this. Perhaps this weekend."

Sure, anybody who works on the code a bit more, or is capable of checking what processes are running in what situations, will notice that this isn't the case, but still.On the other hand, I do like it *if* this is supposed to turn into something that can be used through --disable-base to also bypass *build* of for instance all database-related functionality in *all* aspects of LO, i.e. what the currently stalled --disable-database-connectivity hack was supposed to to."
56884,1,"Patch Set 1: This need some tweaks before it is mergedI agree with Tor's concerns - the idea that you can disable eg. charting, or calc - and still be able to load documents is -seriously- poisonous: it essentially cannot be done reliably -nor- are we interested in fixing the bugs.Last time I discussed this with you; I believe I mentioned that (from my perspective) this would only be acceptable in master with some serious warnings. As soon as a single one of these disable options is used we need to:* remove any versioning information from Help->About - and replace it with some scary string: ""un-supportable version configured - this product is missing key functionality and will not work""  [ might do it ].* display a huge warning at the end of configure:  ""You disabled some pieces of LibreOffice - you are now running an un-supported configuration against which we are not interested in receiving bug reports, you are on your own. Please, under no circumstances package or distribute  this sort of build, it will lead only to you getting a very hard stare.""* Preferably add some form of interactive confirmation of this during the build to make it even harder for packagers to do this: a simple ""hit enter to continue"" followed by a 'read' statement might do it at the end of configure ;-)Anyhow - at least with that - if someone has shipped that - we can detect and ignore them more easily, and (I hope) packagers will not be so foolish as to do this.How does that sound ? :-)"
56888,1,"Patch Set 1:still TODO:* warn in configure script if that option provided.

56890,1,"Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approveAs already expressed elsewhere:http://nabble.documentfoundation.org/Master-branch-now-requires-liborcus-0-5-0-or-higher-tp4049684p4051339.htmlI am wary of spreading the tree of build scenarios even further. Its not as if we dont have enough work with the existing ones. However, with big-fat-red-warnings suggested by Michael, I think this is acceptable. After all Lionels point stands: Distros are doing it, so it is done already -- and _if_ its done, the right place is upstream, not some packaging hack.Oh, one more thing: This should not only get a warning in the binary, but also big one at the end of ./configure, saying that it is an ""experimental and unsupported build, use at own risk ..."".E.g. subsequentchecks will obviously fail with partial builds, and it not the job of those maintaining those tests to fix that up, but must be part of the work on this feature (as is helping out unsuspecting newcomers accidentally enabling this and asking for help on the list or IRC) before it can move anywhere from ""experimental and unsupported""."
56893,1,Patch Set 4:Just one point. There is one big difference between building all and installing only one part and building only some parts of LibO.In-build tests that require two different modules like calc + base or writer + calc will eventually break.I don't think it is a reason to not implement this but it should be clear that these tests will eventually appear and break that feature and IMO it is then the task of the people maintaining this feature to fix this.One case that I know that will soon see such tests in slowcheck is chart2 for some nasty copy&paste bugs.

57069,1,"Patch Set 1:Hi Tor,The remove-and-rebuild test is indeed the criteria that I'm using. There's too many files to check by hand so a automated or at least semi-automated approach is necessary.Anyway, thanks for the comments! I hadn't thought about indirect inclusion. How about this refined approach:For each .cxx file,1) Use the brute-force approach to find candidate headers for removal, and use ""g++ -H"" to dump out a full list of all included headers 2) If a candidate header shows up *once* in the list from g++ -H, it's definitely unnecessary and we remove it. If it shows up more than once (via indirect inclusion), then we leave it alone for now.This should give a smaller list of includes to remove, or in the case of no indirect inclusions, the same list.Are there any other pitfalls that are worth looking out for? Cheers,Michael"

57143,1,Patch Set 1:Is there a reason why you see the need for python unit tests? When evaluating the options for our unit testing frameworks we also evaluated the use of python to write our tests and decide against it for several reasons including the problems while debugging the tests.I'm a bit concerned with adding a new language for testing the c++ code. We have already the java test which go through the uno java bridge and it turned out to be a real pain to maintain these tests.Personally I prefer to keep tests in the same language as the code that should be tested to make it easier to maintain them.
57146,1,"Patch Set 2: (4 inline comments)well i think that while Markus has a point that mixed languague tests may be more difficult to debug when they fail, currently the main problem is that we don't have nearly enough tests in the first place, so efforts to make it easier to write tests (such as Python with much nicer syntax with less boilerplate) are very welcome."
57147,1,"Patch Set 2:Isn't this a bit like deciding the right language for implementing UNO services in core?There (as far as I understand) the opinion is that new code should use C++, but Java -> Python conversion is considered useful (think of converting wizards). Can't we apply the same rule here, saying that for new tests, C++ is preferred, but converting existing Java tests to Python is useful?Also, I wonder how hard would it be to run the Python tests in-process; IIRC there is already support for running ""Python scripts"", couldn't that be reused to avoid the remote UNO pain we have right now with Java tests?"

57165,0,"Patch Set 1:There seems to be some misunderstanding how Java versions work, and how Java is used in LO.IMNSO, this whole ""configure the JVM version"" thing has no purpose at all.LO, to the best of my knowledge, requires a minimum version of Java, but other than that has no Java-version-specific code at all.And Java is fully backwards-compatible. A newer VM can __always__ run .class files from an older VM.So allowing the user to change the version of .class files we produce has no benefit, and only adds unnecessary complexity.The only thing we should be doing at autogen time is confirming that the version of Java available to autogen meets our minimum version requirements."
57166,0,"Patch Set 1:@Noel: Well, in theory targeting a newer VM might give you optimizations and faster execution, shouldnt it? In practice, there likely is no relevant improvement in JVMs on that since 1.5.So in practice, having yet-another-configure-switch for this minor benefit is not entirely justified. At least not without some serious profiling.IMHO _that_ is the rationale to decide this on (and indeed -- as of now to respectfully reject it), as for the rest the decision will be on the packager anyway and is mostly none of the projects business (which should care about the source and not about the binaries)."

From reading the code, I ""see"" that it is called when the report is in ""insert mode"" as opposed to ""selection mode"". My guess is that ""select mode"" is when (in the reports control toolbar) ""Select"" (the arrow mouse pointer) is selected and ""insert mode"" is when some kind of control is selected (e.g. ""Label field"", ""text box"", ..., ""Vertical line"", etc).

57263,1,"Patch Set 1:In this specific case and with the current SQL grammar, pParamRef cannot be NULL: a general_set_fct has at least four children (and in particular strictly more than two), so pParamRef has been initialised with: pParamRef = pColumnRef->getChild(nColumnRefPos);That's too subtle for coverity (and possibly warrants at least a comment).I'm not opposed to adding a specific NULLness check, which would future-proof the code a bit against changes in the grammar.Adding the NULLness check to the macro looks good to me from a safety POV; it could make the code in general a bit slower, but I don't think the impact would be significant enough that anybody would care."
57264,1,"Patch Set 1: AbandonedThank you Lionel for your feedback.I'm really hesitating about all this, the more I think about this the more I consider the check in SQL_IS_RULE like equivalent to hide the problem. I suppose I must be wrong but I prefer to abandon this patch."

After top-level make && make dev-install the menu was   still OK so I prepared the patch.But now, with a fresh user profile, it is not OK.Apparently I did something that triggered a change in the behaviour that ended in the user profile?A diff of the two registrymodification.xcu files gives a lot output (tried some more e.g. Personas in the build too) so that is not easy for me to get though.Of course, it might well be that I've overseen something.Any hints?(I can do something prolly Thursday evening / Friday afternoon)."

57513,1,"Patch Set 3: Fails; I would prefer that you didn't submit thisThe hardest part of this was finding out that X11SalGraphics::GetGlyphBoundRect was involved, so kudos to discovering that.The workaround to search the lower levels if a glyph isn't found however is a bit of a bodge, because I don't think we shuold be asking for the wrong glyphs there in the first place. I think http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/commit/?id=98f56121858b4bea54d056a073005a10648785c6 should work instead.In MultiSalLayout::GetBoundRect we loop through each fallback font and union each level's GetBoundRect to get the result, which seems reasonable, except that for each level that's means a call to SalLayout::GetBoundRect which calls X11SalGraphics::GetGlyphBoundRect.Those sublevels SalLayouts don't know that they are sublevels so they never set the level bits on their glyphs. Which results in X11SalGraphics::GetGlyphBoundRect always searching for that glyph in the level 0 font, so there's a mismatch between the font the SalLayout's are created to use and the font that gets used.Now, SalLayout::GetBoundRect is a fairly simple thing, it just calls GetNextGlyphs 1 by 1 and X11SalGraphics::GetGlyphBoundRect on the result of that.  So I *think* that if we remove the specialized MultiSalLayout::GetBoundRect in favour of the default implementation, then because MultiSalLayout::GetNextGlyphs is specialized to do-the-right-thing and set up the glyph ids correctly, then we bubble the ids down to X11SalGraphics::GetGlyphBoundRect correctly to get it to use the right font and we get the correct bounding size."

57674,0,"Patch Set 2:Some context would be nice, please?"
57680,1,"Patch Set 1: Fails; Do not submitNice idea :-)  But.. it doesn't work as intended.First, the function should not calculate both paths (which is automatically done to pass results of expressions as arguments), it should work more like the IF() function, where a conditional path is only calculated for the corresponding condition.Second, this implementation works only for some cases. =IFERROR(1/0,2)works and result is 2, but already =IFERROR(1/0,2+3)propagates the #DIV/0! error instead of returning 5. Also =IFERROR(1+1,1/0)propagates the #DIV/0! error instead of returning 2.I suggest you take a look at the implementation of ocIf and use a similar approach with only one conditional path instead of two, for which the condition is calculated from the expression's result whether it is an error or not and then a jump is executed or not. There is some special code in the compiler to calculate jump paths (lookout for ocIf), and handling is different from normal functions in the interpreter.

57786,1,"Patch Set 1:@Mat鈹溾晳鈹济?Kukan: Dropping ooo.lst and moving this to a makefile makes sense imho.For debian/ubuntu we want to download ~all tarballs, no matter what the configure says, so that we can toggle --with-system-foo on and off at will without needing a new source tarball.Currently that is tricky to do as the filenames are hidden somewhere in ./configure.ac.I was preparing a patch to just get the filenames back into ooo.lst, but your proposal is even better.Do you get that done by 4.0 branchoff?"

57792,0,"Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisIn general, such ifdeffed-out code should not be removed just blindly, but one should check for how long it has been ifdeffed out, and whether there is any comment indicating it is soemthing a still active developer intends to get back to, etc.In this case, I think this code might well be useful, if only we had somebody who was working on this part of the code and was interested in this self-check functionality.(Personally I have no idea what a ""job"" or ""job URL"" is.)There is a comment in joburl.cxx that says: ""It's used for internal purposes only and never a part of a legal product. Use it for testing and debug only!"" so I think it's clear that the intent is that you #define ENABLE_COMPONENT_SELF_CHECK only in your own work copy while working on this code, and that such a #define never gets into version control.Now, another question is then whether we have anybody who knows what this code does, and is interested in debugging and developing it. Would it be better to test DBG_UTIL instead of ENABLE_COMPONENT_SELF_CHECK, to at least make sure the code still compiles (in a --enable-dbgutil build) and doesn't break at run-time?SOme discussion on the mailing list needed IMHO."

57806,1,"Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisI think you should split this into three patches, one for Unix-only code, one for cross-platform code, and one for Windows-only code. That would make it easier to actually verify.I see at least one real problem in the patch for crashrep/source/unx/main.cxx: you change it to use %u for a size_t variable that isn't cast. This breaks when compiled for 64-bit, where %u is for 32-bit unsigned int, and size_t is 64-bit. There might be other similar issues elsewhere in the patch. But note that the crashrep module is not built so your changes to it won't even get compiled...That said, I wonder if it is correct of that main.cxx to use size_t for the return value of ftell(). Is there no Unix where in 32-bit code ftell() still returns a 64-bit value?"

57875,0,"Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisHi Mathias,first thanks for your patch. It is great start; Well, it does some non-standard things. I suggest to re-shufle it a bit :-)1. You already mentioned that you were unsure about    downloading the files inside configure. I suggest to   do it using the download script.   You might already see the many @FILENAME@ entries in   ooo.lst.in. They are optional. If you do not define such    variable in configure, it will be empty in the generated    ooo.lst file and it will not be downloaded.2. If you use download, it will get the files into the   $TARFILE_LOCATION instead of $SRC_ROOT/moz/zipped.      I suggest to modify the related makefiles in ""moz""    module to find the .zip archives in $TARFILE_LOCATION   Note that this approach follows the current trends.   In the past, we copied many 3rd party tarballs into   the related build subdirectories. We do not longer   do it. We already updated most makefiles to unpack the    tarballs directly from the $TARFILE_LOCATION.   3. I suggest to do not copy the dlls in configure because    it is not typical. Instead, I suggest to define variables   that will point to the files. Then you could copy the   files in the makefile that need to use the dlls.4. Please, do not remove the TABs from configure.in from    lines 4469-4515. These lines are copied into ""Makefile""    that is later tested. TABs are important in Makefiles,   so your change breaks this test.Thanks a lot for working on it. Feel free to ask if you are in doubts."

57905,1,"Patch Set 1: Do not submitHmm, I am confused by all the changes:1. In the dmake fix, it does not make sense to save   the number of read items and just increment it.      Instead, it would make sense to check if it really   did read the item, for example:      if (fread( (char *)&flhdr, sizeof(flhdr), 1, f ) != 1) return (-1);   2. In the lpsolve fix, it is not a good idea to redirect all   error messages to /dev/null. It would hide real build   errors as well.      Instead, it would be better to fix the lpsolve code   to do not produce warnigns at all.3. The concat-deps.c is strange as well. It is a similar   problem like in dmake.      IMHO, we need to return an error if it does not write   the whole item => you need to modify the function   print_fullpaths to return integer instead of void.   Then you could use something like:      if (fwrite(token, token_len, 1, stdout) != 1) return EIO;      Of course, you need to handle the print_fullpaths return   value where it is called."
57907,1,"Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisI am sorry for the late response. I am busy with preparing the tag for 3.6.3-rc3.Hmm, I still do not like your solution. In short:1. It would be better to squash all the commits into one. It is easier to review. Also it would help if you later investigate the git history. You could use     git rebase -i origin/master   and follow the instructions2. You patch hides potential errors using thatif( function_call(...) ) ; construct . It means that the application could proceed random data. Instead, it should propagate the errors. For example, it should return (-1) in dmake if it was not able to read the data.

The goal was to do a firts timer job in the code base before doing a more in depth contribution. So I am going to the next step :)"
58008,1,"Patch Set 1: Do not submitI think this change is wrong. Simply removing the code leads to the situation that all input is parsed against the standard default language/locales's General format, effectively accepting anything that could be parsed as a number whatsoever, including date and time. If values were to be formatted in a different locale already a simple number containing a decimal separator could not work.It looks like actually the format index should be obtained from the corresponding input field instead as it was set in ScaleTabPage::SetNumFormat() with, for example, aFmtFldMax.SetFormatKey( nFmt )"
58013,1,"Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisso this change essentially reverts 8b5a984d45005d3df1c89eae897d6e04612625d8,with a commit message that:- does not mention that it does revert that- does not contain any description of an  actual problem that is fixed here- also removes the ""touch"" without any  explanation why it is unnecessarywith my hat as gbuild maintainer on, the mostlikely thing that will happen after merging thispatch is that i will spend half a day fixingthe breakage that will inevitably result fromthe consequences of the patch that the authoris not aware of (which is incidentally exactlywhat happened after8b5a984d45005d3df1c89eae897d6e04612625d8)."
58014,1,"Patch Set 1: Do not submitIndeed, I should have searched in git history.It was supposed to generate proper DEP files in one 'make iteration'.So you don't have to run make again.And I was hoping to do more.But it is probably desired behavior as it is now.And it re-introduces problem solved by 8b5a984d45005d3df1c89eae897d6e04612625d8.So I am going to abandon this patch.Thanks for reviewing."
58017,1,Patch Set 1:I agree. It looks like Caol鈹溍璶's change might actually solve this problem. Either way my change is obsolete. I'll update and investigate.
58018,1,Patch Set 1: AbandonedChange is obsolete following http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/commit/?id=b0f170d7df9cff12535d2ecfd146b32b745a8ef8I'll investigate again after updating to latest.

58027,1,Patch Set 1: AbandonedThis clean would modify a bit the logic and could be unsafe
58030,1,"Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisGreat, but please avoid changes in GetPrinterSelection, empty string means ""the whole range"", not ""the current page"". Also it fails to compile to me - mnCurPage has to be sal_Int32, compiler says ""error: call of overloaded 脭脟每valueOf(int)脭脟脰 is ambiguous"".Thanks!"
58032,0,"Patch Set 1:As an after-thought, I think that the 2 loops are actually needed since the first one updates rMin and rMax (passed by reference to lcl_CheckMinMax), which then are used (read only) in the second loop.Maybe adding some comments could be useful to clarify the behaviour of the original code."
58033,1,"Patch Set 1: AbandonedYes I was wrong there. It does work properly when I debug (gets called when a column is deleted), but will fail on some edge cases, so, I am abandoning this."
58036,1,"Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisplease dont duplicaye diffs in the commit message. Also, I might be confused, but I fail to see how this code improves the code quality or brings it more in line with the LibreOffice code conventions."
58039,0,Patch Set 1: Fails; Do not submitSo - IMHO we should hold fire on any of this (nice) sort of cleanup until the rebasing process is complete - at least for the code in question.

192,1,"Patch Set 10: Code-Review+1I think we are close enough to go ahead with this.We'll need to fix some of the issues with running async with gdbserver, but we can address this after RC1.  Besides, I think getting the full console is important enough to take this risk."
207,1,Patch Set 4:I think this is a serious concern.  I hadn't thought of it before.We should look at how the platform console does this.  You can clone the platform console view and each new console will be filled with all the text.  Our TracingConsole class (gdb traces) does this by extending IOConsole.  How do they do this efficiently.  I think they use some kinds of scheme using a document.
209,0,"Patch Set 2:Why trying the new buffering scheme, the last line is not buffered.  This means that the gdb prompt (gdb) does not re-appear when closing and re-opening the Debugger console.  Also, if I start typing something but don't press <enter>, then close the view, then re-open it, what I typed is not shown, but when I press <enter>, what I type is used.That second use-case is not that important, but it would be nice to show the (gdb) prompt if possible."
212,1,Patch Set 6:While testing this I found something obscure but weird that I thought I'd mention.1- Start a debug session with the full console.2- type a very long line in the new console so that the text wraps (don't press enter)3- close the debugger console4- make the space where the console was significantly bigger5- open the debugger console view=> the text is messed up with the cursor higher up than other texts.  This may be a bug with the widget itself.  I just wanted to document it in case it may be related to a bug in this patch.

If the buffer contains some data, it returns that data without waiting for more.We don't flush until readInterrupted is true. That means we don't flush until the pipe is drained."

674,0,"Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1(1 comment)It is not so bad to have it automatic. People doing kernel and ust traces will not expect to have to click the synchronize button for traces taken on the same host (I wouldn't!). So unless the synchronization is automatic, it can be out of the synchronization API.Also the trace-sync does an event request and expects to match events from the various traces. The trace-sync will have to be modified for this trace-wide scenario. Also the new synchronized kernel/ust blob of traces may need to be synchronized with another host entirely through network packet.

The trace-synchronization mechanisms did seem like a good fit, however a lot of work would be required to that to be able to do what we want to do (make it usable with different sync algos, provide an extension point, have a UI for the user to choose which algo(s) to use, etc.) A bit outside of the scope of the bug we're trying to fix here.The approach used here has some limitations, namely that if a trace is used inside different experiments at the same time, the timestamp corrections would stack and apply for all instances of the trace. Not ideal, but that may not be an important use case (the main use case being a UST+kernel trace inside a single experiment).If you don't mind I can take over this patch, brush it up, add some test traces and tests, and we can propose it this form. At least short term the very common use case of kernel + ust traces will be fixed."

Even paying attention to copyright statements.This change certainly cuts neatly through a bunch of unnecessary and wonky code.  I was going to complain that changing the APIs in the UI classes from working with URIs to working with IResources results in a loss of generality, so that it would be more difficult to support exporting diagrams to the host filesystem (which is desperately needed, IMO) or other destinations, and that IResource is not even as appropriate a type as IContainer, but then I observed that the entire export infrastructure beneath the UI is all pinned to the IResource contract, anyways.  That, combined with the fact that any clients trying to use these UI bits would have had to construct nonsense URIs, means that I don't mind that this technically is an API-breaking change because that API was already non-functional and it will have to break again some time anyways to support exporting to non-workspace destinations.  Besides that none of these UI classes should ever have been exposed as API to begin with.All of which is to say thanks for working through the contribution process and do come back for more."

Or is only ports? Has it fixed the issue with the lack of stacking pattern for ports on capsule parts?I am also a bit uncertain what the implications will be regarding the statement about ""always white background"". What it someone wants to put color on different capsule parts, e.g. using CSS customization, will that then be impossible? I guess this will be a bit too restrictive.

1306,1,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1I've tested this patch-set as well. As Asma already have pointed out, you still have the refresh issue for a replicated port placed on the top border. As I have pointed out and proposed in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=500982 this is probably related to the fact the stacking pattern is drawn on the ""outside"" of the original shape instead of in the ""inside"" as it is done in the legacy tooling.Apart from that there is also a major regression related to the orientation of the behavior adornment. If you move around a port placing it on the four different borders, then the behavior adornment used to always be oriented ""inwards"", i.e. it re-orients whenever you move the port to a different border.

1311,1,"Patch Set 2:> Yes, it would solve it, but it might be more difficult to read. The > new patch extends the stackedFigure code to handle elements that > draw outside their original bounds.What do you mean with ""difficult to read""? To read the stacking pattern in the diagram? If you do as in the legacy tooling then I can't say that it will be hard to read. There is actually an aspect that you should not make the figure larger and that is the layout of legacy models. This is especially important for ports on capsule parts which should be 11x11 pixels large, disregarding if the stacking pattern is shown or not. The reason for the proposal to keep the stacking pattern on the inside is actually more about aligning with the layout of legacy models and size of ports there, see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=496304 for initial work related to this (but that one did not include the aspect of replicated ports, since we track that separately with https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=497825 and improvements in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=500982)."

But it's worth soliciting feedback from the users who strongly wanted this feature back.I think we should *always* show other projects in the Other category.  The menu item to enable this (""ÔÇªand show remaining projects in "") looks rather bizarre.

Words describing steps to > reproduce, or else a video capture, would be more helpful.Yes, I agree. It was not fully clear for me either from Adams screen shot what the differences were. But if you take a closer look between the screen shot for case 1 and case 2, the difference is that the ""black line"" has its ending a bit further in for case 2, i.e. the intention is to move p2 inside the package Protocols. For case 1 the intention is not to move p2 inside package Protocols but order it after, i.e. it should be a peer to the package Protocols.Anyway, since case 2 is about moving p2 inside the package Protocols, I assume that the expected result should be that p2 should be moved before p1 inside the package Protocols. As it looks now, it replaces it, at least when just looking in the model explorer with the protocol customization enabled. But the protocol message from p1Msg is now contained in p2 instead.If I disable the protocol customization, then it looks like a real mess. Not sure at all what have happened.Does this give more information about which gesture to make?"

You can import only the top level of the releng. But once the Bug 500287 will be merged, the codegen TP's will be into the Target platform folders at the root .

I've tested it with GTK2 and GTK3 and it's the same. I don't see any abnormal indent.Concerning ""Remember selected filters"" in filters preference page it does not seems to be the same for the two tabs. Is it normal or these two tabs should have this option? For the Groups preference page it will be possible to move this field above the tabs, but it will be more consistent if the filters and the groups have the same layout."
2015,0,"Patch Set 6:Hello Simon,1) For the indent, I notice (under windows) that pages 'Editor', 'Item Providers', 'Logging' and 'Post-Processors' display options that are slightly indented with regard to the page title. Other pages display fields that are perfectly aligned with the page title. i'll send you some screenshots by mail.2) For the 'remember selected x': It's normal that it's not present for each tab of the filters. So it definitely should be displayed above, with a label that explains that this preference makes it so that the editor will automatically reuse the latest group/filter list used in the latest comparison. So I think this check box should be extracted and displayed on top of the page for both groups and filters."
2016,0,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1 Verified+1(1 comment)Hi Simon,thanks for the work! Looks good already! Just a few more thoughts on the pages below. Thanks a lot!Page Engines  * In the Configuration group for tab Match is some padding to the right and hence makes the min width larger then needed.  * The description area has a slightly different background than the rest (on my Linux box using GTK2). It has the right background in the post processor page and the item providers page.Page Filters  * I'd decrease min width a bit  * The description area has a slightly different background than the rest (on my Linux box using GTK2). It has the right background in the post processor page and the item providers page.  * The label ""Automatic behavior"" is misleading. Firstly, this label doesn't really mean a lot. Maybe something like ""Remember selected group"" would be better. Secondly, this preference is independent from the selected group/filter, still it is on the same level as the Description group, which is dependent on the selection. Maybe we should put the description and the list of filters into a group?Page Groups  * Label at the top has a larger margin to the list below than on previous pages.  * Same last two as for filtersItem Providers  * To be consistent with other pages in EMF Compare (e.g. post processors), it'd be good to have a brief label at the top. E.g.: ""Select active item providers used in the comparison editor:"""

2019,0,"Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1 Verified+1Hi Simon, thanks for the new PS. I think it is nearly perfect!I think you only forgot to address this point from the last review:  * The label ""Automatic behavior"" is misleading. Firstly, this label doesn't really mean a lot. Maybe something like ""Remember selected group"" would be better.And in addition I found another minor thing:  * When opening the item providers page, there is no item provider selected automatically, which leaves the description empty -- and this looks a bit strange. In all the other pages, the first entry of the respective list is selected, which is better, I think, than leaving the selection empty.Thanks!"
2020,1,"Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1Thank you Simon for this patch, it looks better and better!The improvement is already measurable, though a few things remain to be improved I think:- Filters  - There's a useless box around 'Select the filters that should be active...'  - I think on the other hand a box labeled 'Description' has been removed when it should stay as it was    (in other pref pages, when there is the same kind of master/detail panel, we use a group for the details)  - 'Remember selected filters' should be on one line abouve the tabs since it is independent of 2-way/3-way preferences.    The group 'Remember selected filters' should actually be removed, and 'Synchronize current filter selection:' should be renamed to    'Reuse selected filters in future comparisons:', which should be place above the tabs- Groups:  The same as filters applies to groups. Remove useless box around, and move ""Remember selected groups"" as a single line above the tabs.- Logging:  The fields are indented, they shouldn't be- Post Processors  The fields are indented, they shouldn't be- Resolution strategy  I think some space between the box that contains the description of the selected scope and the text it contains would improve readability."

In the ticket Markus also says that there are similar issues in JDT builds. But we can add it to this commit for the platform. But it looks like in the platform this is the last remaining direct Require-Bundle entry. > Should all bundles with a Service-Component add a Require-Capability > on osgi.extender?Yes I think so. There was a contribution about this in the past, but it didn't work that time because p2 doesn't support OSGi capabilities.

3021,0,"Patch Set 3:Hmm, I had not thought about the case of empty catch blocks (I think they should only apper in situations where the exception really doesn't matter - otherwise there should be at least some debug logging in the catch block).I've thought about it: It should be possible to figure out the thrown exception by requesting ExceptionEvents for ALL thrown exceptions while ""step return"" is in progress and show the last observed exception if JDIThread#hasExitedWithReturn returns false. But this would only be really useful for the case of empty catch blocks and it could slow things further down.I'll think about it a bit."
3023,0,Patch Set 11:Patch looks great till now. One thing is that to avoid performance slowdown we should allow filters so that we can avoid values from java.lang or other packages if user wants to restrict. ( Similar to Step Filters)
3024,1,"Patch Set 11:Regarding further filters: I have tried a bit and haven't found a way to achieve a notable speedup. Exclusion filters for MethodEntryRequests don't work because nested invocations to other packages would still match and this would really complicate things, so the only thing that might be done would be to not start the observing mechanism for Step-Return when in a filtered package (also when triggered by a MethodEntryRequest for Step-Over), but that hasn't shown a notable effect in my experiments. If you have another idea, I'd like to suggest to create another bug for that, as the current patch is already quite big.Another idea would be to make toggling the displaying of step results easier (maybe a button in the toolbar?), but I think that should be done as another bug, too."
3027,1,Patch Set 6:Patch Set 6 contains an optimization for the case that Exception Events are on and a fix (wrong preference key was checked for Exception Events). I'm actually not sure that having a separate preference is a good idea.
3031,1,Patch Set 9:patch set 9 just removes some debug logging (that was non intended to be commited) that broke some tests. reminder to myself: test behaviour of step-over if no line numbers are present
3033,0,"Patch Set 4:While empty catch-blocks may not be that important, having the thrown exception shown in finally block is really great! So I will continue to invest time in this.Note: Patch Set 4 doesn't work correctly if the first catch/finally block is more than one stackframe above the method that where the ""step return"" was triggered. To fix this will need at least some parameter added to some methods  to give JDIStackFrame the information if it is currently the top frame."

Could you suggest > a solution?Some more aspect to consider: * For this version, we _have to_ break existing implementors, as we have to add the new methods to the interface (and there was no abstract base class for implementors available earlier)! This means, in this version, we could more-or-less ignore them, and focus on the future, given we provide a very clear migration path. * If we want to maintain compatibility in the future with _all_ three groups, we essentially cannot modify in the future the runtime context interface, except maybe adding _optional_ features to implement where it is the client responsibility to decide whether the method can be called or not.In the current case, I would aim to provide a good API for future implementors that might be incompatible with existing ones as opposed to having a confusing abstract base class implementation (e.g. infinite loop); and think hard whether we need anything else from the runtime context in order to stabilize it for future versions."

I do have future ideas: Requesting binding-specific indexing services, e.g. requesting that all instances are indexed for retrieval based on the first variable.

Can the existing behaviour work further with the new API (e.g. do we want to deprecate the old methods when we use this)? If both question is answered with yes, we can add it later when we plan to use/implement it without breaking existing index implementations."

Or do we?Hmm, that's news to me. It does make some sense to offer this generic API that works with any supported matcher scope; but I think for EMF in particular, the NavigationHelper API (or a future version of it) is more user friendly.Even if we promote the IQRC to end-users in the future, that's hardly an argument to breaking compatiblity now. > Can we provide a default implementation for this feature based on > current functionality? I am not sure what to say. The ""seed"" parameter is already there for the enumerate/count/contains methods. The new functionality would just be that indexing services could be requested for specific bitvectors (which parts of the seed will be given?) as opposed to the entire input key. I believe the default implementation could just request that the whole key be indexed - it would be functionally correct, though it would not bring the performance benefits.> Can the existing behaviour work further with the new API (e.g. do we want to deprecate the old methods when we use this)?Yes and maybe.

3475,1,"Patch Set 14:Ok, lets step back a bit here: who are the implementors and the users of the IQueryRuntimeContext API? Implementors are the Scope providers, and users backend providers? Is this correct? Rete and LS are not problematic, as they are developed in parallel with this API, so they can keep up with the API.The important question is, do we consider the chance that anyone else would implement some query backend in the future that will not be developed in VIATRA? If there won't be anyone, we should close down this API, and then the entire conversation will be moot, and we should indeed consider only the implementors of scopes.However, and I believe, this is the case, if we want to have an API for externals to provide backend implementations, the IQueryRuntimeContext API should remain compatible for both users and implementors, and appropriate steps should be taken to avoid breakage (e.g. the methods there will be in 1.4 should be stable enough). > Even if we promote the IQRC to end-users in the future, that's > hardly an argument to breaking compatiblity now.We have already broken compatibility. By adding new methods to the interface that was implemented directly by scope providers they have to be updated. The only thing we can do is avoid the users of the interface to break as well. > > Can we provide a default implementation for this feature based on > > current functionality? >  > I am not sure what to say.

3480,1,Patch Set 4:(8 comments)Sorry for my belated response. See my comments below.
3482,0,"Patch Set 4:> I know I am a bit late to the party, but I think if we have orthogonal variants of indexing ""levels"" then we shouldn't try to implement it as a scale (none < statistics <? notifications < both < full) and should instead treat them as flags (statistics, notifications, instances).On the indexing API, this does make a lot of sense, and it would definitely be more future-proof. However, on the implementation side (the actual base index), the concerns are not truly orthogonal (e.g. if we have 'instance' indexing, we get stats and notifications practically for free), so there are only really these 5 modes of operation. The nontrivial part of the lattice logic must be provided somewhere (e.g. if matcher backend A requests instance and notification indexing, we do nothing when backend B later requests stats). So with a bit more work, we could probably have ├übel's service flags on the IQRC API, and the indexing level enum or something equivalent in the base index itself. Is it worth it?Also, what's the nicest way to provide the 'flags'? @Data class with three boolean fields? EnumSet for a three-valued enum representing the three services? Constants with values 0b001, 0b010 and 0b100 that can be binary OR-ed, like in the good old times?"

Otherwise, make it an interface > similar to IInputKey (note how a given implementation checks > whether a given key is valid for a give context).I understand your concerns. It is clear that the API should reflect the services provided by the base indexer, and the IndexingLevel enum approaches this concept from the implementation side. After reading your comments, I think it would be better to use flags on the API, and the indexing level would remain specific to the NavigationHelper. The flags could be unambiguously transformed to the base indexer levels by the IQRC implementation. For flags, using bitfields or @Data classes are either acceptable in my opinion.What do you think about this approach?"
3485,0,"Patch Set 4:Bal├ízs: I'm satisfied with your plan. Do we have the time budget for it? P.S. I would prefer EnumSet over bitfield, with an enum like IndexerService {STATISTICS, NOTIFICATION, INSTANCES}."

But the Utils shouldn't need it, it uses textExtent().- The early exit based on the bounds width should remain in the view implementations, that's what is using the averageCharWidth.- The cached averageCharWidth in the views probably does not take into account the different fonts when zooming vertically, however it's only used as a width treshold, maybe it's OK?- It's much too costly in Linux GTK to get the averageCharWidth (and/or font metrics) from the GC for every drawing operation."

3827,1,"Patch Set 3:(5 comments)Sounds like an interesting idea ÔÇö but it really needs some tests, and some stylistic practices need to be backed out (i.e., use of Class#isInstance() and Class#cast() is inconsistent with the rest of the code).Have you thought about loosening the restriction from MArea to MGenericTile?  It would be nice to have a M1+M2+'M' that would progressively maximize a part within its PSC ancestry; it could be handy for the Debug perspective, for example."

3898,0,"Patch Set 7: Code-Review-1(10 comments)Hello Stefan,I didn't have the time to make a full review but I can't continue right now so I publish a partial review. More to come soon (I hope!)"
3899,0,"Patch Set 7: Code-Review-1(8 comments)Thanks for your partial review, Laurent! While doing a review on my own and incorporating your review, I found a problem that when only the UML file is changed, the approach won't work too.I re-investigated this problem and thought about it a while... the nicest way would be to avoid loosing the information on the resources in scope during the minimization; that is, minimizing the scope but storing somewhere which resources had been in scope at the beginning. Then it would be very easy to check if a .di file was in the scope.Ideally, we could change that in the ComparisonScopeBuilder. However, e.g. the EMFModelProvider calls the IdenticalResourceMinimizer before the ComparisonScopeBuilder is even used to create the scope later down the road. Thus, there is no central point that we could change in order to retain the list of original resources in the scope.(On a side note, I stumbled across a potential source if problems: SynchronizationModel.getResources() is created lazily. If getResources() is called before the minimizer is applied to the SynchronizationModel, it'll contains the original set of resources also after the minimization. If it is called afterwards, it won't contain it. Sometimes getResources() it is called before the minimization step, such as in org.eclipse.emf.compare.ide.ui.internal.logical.EMFModelProvider.getOrComputeLogicalModel(IFile, ResourceMappingContext, IProgressMonitor), sometimes it isn't. So we cannot trust that the getResources() is minimal or not. I'll add a task for myself to open a separate BR on that.)So my best remaining idea so far: remove the comparison scope adapter introduced in this review again and instead introduce a postprocessor that checks if any .di file exists for the matched resources and if yes, mark the comparison as a PapyrusComparison.For marking the comparison as a Papyrus, the nicest way would be introducing a context field into the Comparison model. If we don't want to change the comparison model, we again could add an adapter to it in order to mark it. But that's not particularly clean :)What do you think about the above mentioned postprocessor approach? It is not super-efficient, as we theoretically had the information already that we obtain again in the postprocessor. But at least we only do it once for each comparison instead of checking it again and again in the different UI components."
3900,0,"Patch Set 7: -Code-ReviewHello Philip, thank you for your thorough analysis.I think it'd be nice if SynchronizationModel had a method providing the URIS of all the resources that are involved in its non-minimized form.Do you think it would solve the problem?"

I thought at first that maybe the Papyrus milestone and nightly targets would include the unqualified target to get all of the other base dependencies and just add their own flavour of Papyrus onto that.  But they don't, and the unqualified TPD also includes Papyrus from the Neon simultaneous release which basically makes it the same as the ""Papyrus milestone"" TPD because the Neon repository includes the Papyrus milestones."

""pick whatever you need from the latest version of the entire world""). Easy to maintain, but highly unsafeThe TPD itself is usually not as detailed as the actual target platform (Although it could be, I guess), and fills some gaps in the editor and features (Especially the include directive)There would still be some benefits in going this way, but also much more issues in my opinion.

The wrapper will be sent only to the custom state value, and it will be either for a read OR write operation. Never the same wrapper for both.So I would tend to think two separate wrapper classes would be even simpler (and no need for a flip() then). What do you think?"

OSGi is a layer on top of base Java to restrict exposing public things, so that they can be internal, or x-friends with their friends. If something is public AND non-internal, then it becomes a OSGi API.But non-public things have never been considered API, they are completely inaccessible from things outside their own package. This is restricted at the compiler level.Our compiler settings don't enforce javadoc for default and private members, because those are necessarily invisible from outside their package.Tbh, I don't think it's a bad idea to put Javadoc on all classes, more information is always good. But we never enforced it on anything (non-public) before, so I wonder what we absolutely have to start NOW, on a patch that is already quite time-critical. I think we should have least have the same standards as we have elsewhere."

There are some many little bugs in SWTChart, it's terrible...If you have a log scale, you need all series to have the same amount of entries. So if you have values with ""null"", we have to provide a dummy value. But the dummy can't be zero, because logscale doesn't support 0. So we can compute a minimal value > 0 that is still smaller than all the values in the series. But then if we set the axis to start at that value, we lose all the ticks on the axis...We'll try to figure out a solution by the end of today.

5712,1,"Patch Set 7:> What do you mean with ""not reappear""? The report, as I understand it is let's assume project A with a child B and a child C. A, B and C are projects.With the project layout as hierarchical, bug 461266 reports that if one deletes B, then the folder ""B"" doesn't reappear without a refresh, so folder B and child project C are not visible.With patch set 5. 6 and 7, it seems to me that there in no change regarding this issue: B would still be invisible as a folder upon project deletion.>  The refresh for this never occurred, just put the breakpoint in the actual refresh call: asyncExec() is never called from this PRE_DELETE path.I wouldn't affirm that the code fully works as expected, but with patch set #4, the issue explained above and in the bug report seems to be fixed.The purpose is NOT to refresh on PRE_DELETE but to populate the parentsToRefresh on PRE_DELETE with the parent of the deleted project, then, once the deletion is performed, actually refresh parent on POST_CHANGE."

5758,1,"Patch Set 1:> you can say you really do care about receiving the right information and are ready to wait for it if necessary or if null will be enough for you.Ok, presented this way it's more fitting. ""You may wait on something, somewhere, maybe"", and the caller doesn't have to know what exactly.Another question: how would callers know if a particular aspect is a BlockingAspect or not. They have to do an instanceof check? Would it be possible/desirable to just put the blocking version of the method in the main interface too (and have a default implementation that defers to not blocking) ?"
5759,1,"Patch Set 1:I was thinking that if they use the aspect directly, then they know if it's blocking or not. Otherwise, they typically would call TmfTraceUtils.resolveAspectBlaBlaBla and there we would add a blocking parameter. They instanceof check would be done there, so no need to bother the base interface with an additional method.What would be less costly? A default method in the base interface that calls the other method for all aspect classes, or an instanceof check at runtime?"
5760,1,"Patch Set 1:Instanceof check implies all callers have to know about it, so I would prefer the alternative.We just have to make sure what makes sense as a default setting (to block or not to block), and analysis that don't really care can just call the standard resolve(event);"

So I better understand why Bernd is now surprised that Views comes last in the list.> So I guess keeping lexicographical order was not discussed at that meeting then, perhaps this aspect was overlooked.1- Gerrit please don't reformat this!2- It was discussed, and the thought was it should be like photoshop/code block/qt creator/audacity/eclipse's plugins menu: external stuff below the built-in. We actually wondered if out of alphabetical order was going to make the users experience off and concluded that changing the convention set up by many other applications would be far worse.3- Notice the question mark next to views? that was there in the wiki, we didn't come to a conclusion on that point. It was more of a ""We can't think of anything better, let's put this here then update it"" item.4- The main conclusion (according to my memory) was the #2 was the proposal to take. We moved on to other topics after, we did not spend 3 hours on this one point.I think the amount of responses though is good, it shows that we all care about the users getting the best trace analysis experience possible.

6640,1,"Patch Set 4:> Wow - this was really close. I tested this on Windows and already > typed in my +2 message. Only picking up one cup of coffee saved us > from accidentily submitting thisI still think this fix is the right thing to do, not closing resource is never a good idea but this change is defeating the RepositoryCache creator original intent, which I think was to keep stuff around as long as possible by using SoftReference.I tested this series and so far the memory consumption drastically improved because the RepositoryCache is no longer slowly growing but I can see that the disk IO increased and performance degraded in operations involving many repositories, like listing projects in Gerrit (ls-projects command).Relying on the SoftReference mechanism to evict old unused repository is not a good idea because the eviction becomes unpredictable. For example, our Gerrit master JVM heap is set to 58GB, the old generation space(Tenured Generation) is 44GB which leaves 14GB for the eden and survivor spaces. The old generation space eventually becomes full (mostly by the caches including the unbound RepositoryCache) and then the application starts slowing down because GC keeps kicking in. The SoftReference are still not being collected at that point because the buffer of available memory is not bellow the threshold that would make GC consider the SoftReference.All this to say that I will do more testing on our production server but if it turns out that the performance impact is too big, I(we) will need to consider reimplementing the RepositoryCache to achieve the goal of keeping repository in memory but without being forever (I am not sure yet what would be the eviction criteria)."

There are some bundles in neon which can't be unpacked by Java 7's unpack200 since they have been packed using Java 8 and Java 7 is unable to unpack them and p2 is too dumb to use the corresponding jar as a fallback :-(I switched back the egit.gerrit job to use Java 7 and retriggered the buildI am now first trying to find the cause for the problems I currently face with running egit core tests from maven (also using mars target platform).

They are only needed if you import only a subset of the source projects from git; if you import them all, then your workspace will have all of the RT bundles and so you won't need them in the PDE target (which, of course, won't be possible until there's a neon build)."

7012,1,"Patch Set 8: Code-Review-1From memory this does the wrong thing because I did a similar implementation last time. The difference is what the default is if the string is missing in the configuration. If there is no configuration then the settings.getBoolean() will return false (IIRC) which means that you can't tell the difference between someone who hasn't set this value and someone who has explicitly disabled the setting. In fact I think this will have the opposite behaviour in that skipGeneration will now explicitly be false and thus always generate it in the case of a missing value. At least that is the case if getBoolean returns a boolean (as opposed to a Boolean). That said if you've tested it and done all the cases (running with a clean workbench without Oomph modifying the setting behind your back, checking the default works of not set, it persists once you have set it etc.) then I'm happy to withdraw my -1"

As much as I like the cleaned up code more I haven't thought about it sufficiently to know if that's an issue (or if it is, whether it's something we can live with). If we're going to invert the setting then we should probably use a different setting for the dialog, and then upgrade it from old to new on first run."

The problem is that tab and org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote.tabs.RemoteCDSFMainTab do the same thing, but the latter for debug and the former for run. With the two different tabs for Main we end up in this situation that if you open Debug or Run launch ui, you end up with different UI on screen. I can better explain (with a screenshot if needed) when I get back to my desk.BTW if we don't deprecate RemoteCMainTab, we should not deprecate org.eclipse.cdt.launch.ui.CMainTab either. Final note, what I meant by:>  I don't think I will have time before M6/API freeze to rework this properly.is that I won't have time to refactor/review the code to be able to simply remove CMainTab and all children (including RemoteCMainTab) as that removal needs further updating the plugin.xml.

7432,1,"Patch Set 6:> Well, and now that the tests have been removed, can you please > reconsider your vote? > That's the issue with -2, it's still here despite the last patch > set fixes the expressed concerns.As I mentioned earlier, I will do more detailed review after we are done with M5. Right now, the existing -2, although it's stale after you adjusted the patch, does not harm anyone, especially that the patch cannot be merged due to the test week. It does not mean -2 is still valid, but that this is the last valid review for which I had time. I don't plan to update my review votes each time new patch set comes in without having time to actually review the patch. There is nothing wrong with the patch, you just need to be patient to allow me to review it again. Thanks for understanding."
7433,0,"Patch Set 6:And by the way, to give a more concrete example, right now we are having a lot more urgent UI bugs to tackle which put in risk our Mars.2 RC2 and Neon M5 releases, so if you guys have free cycles, I would really like to ask you to help there - see bug 486804 and recent emails on the releng and ui mailing lists. We are now trying to release from 2 streams at the same time so it's not an easy task if unexpected things happen and we don't have enough people (read: committers) involved in helping with the release. Thank you again for you help."
7436,0,"Patch Set 4:What makes it wrong to have this test inside eclipse.core.runtime repo? I don't see the benefit of removing it from here to have it into resources. However, I'm fine with putting a copy of this test into resources, additionally to having it there. The value here is that builds using the -Pbuild-individual-bundles profile, such as gerrit validation job, will run this test when test for eclipse.core.runtime are ready to be run with tycho-surefire-plugin."
7438,1,"Patch Set 4:Note that although I'd like to have this test available in that same repository as the change, I'm ok with duplicating it to the resources repository as well if it makes sense, until we can build eclipse.platform.runtime repository individually (requires bug 486478 to be resolved)."
7439,1,"Patch Set 4:Duplication is wrong. Simply add the test where the rest of content type tests are located. When/If there will be need to move content type tests, then we will move them all together instead of merging from different locations."

7471,0,"Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1 Verified+1Looks fine to me, I don't know why this should be faster but I trust Sonar, Mickael and Sergey. Also the code is better readable."
7472,0,"Patch Set 2:It's faster because:* for (entry:map.entrySet()) entry.getValue(); simply used the returned values without computing nor resolving anything* for (key:map.keySet()) map.get(key); computes the hashCode and resolves in the map.So it saves as many lookups as there are element on the map.With Groovy shell CLI, I tried an example: a Map<String, int> where the key is the String representation of the number and the value is the value (such as ""0"":0, ""1"",1, ""432432"":432432...), and made this map from 0 to 10000000.Then I iterated on that map to comupte the sum of all the values.Iterating with keySet and looking up for value cost me about 5 seconds; iterating on entrySet cost me less than 1 second."

7569,1,Patch Set 10: Code-Review-1I agree with Genevi├¿ve's point it's weird to maintain one backend object in the base class. It should be the sub-classes responsibility.I'll push a proposal.
7572,0,"Patch Set 7: Code-Review-1I still don't agree on the following:* ""allowNulls"", the design of the state system is that there should be no null values when returning from a query. It's not explicitely enforced in the backends' runtime code, but it could be. Testing this means testing cases that are not supposed to happen.* The two ""abstract"" methods (getBackendForBuilding/getBackendForQuerying). The concept of ""reopening"" only applies to the HistoryTreeBackend, this notion should remain in that test class, not in the -Base. Parameters and the ""reopen"" constructor parameter is a nice way to offer both alternatives.The abstract method I'm suggesting tells the implementation to ""create a backend and insert these intervals"". This is a clear initialization step.The pattern of an abstract method to set a protected field is used in other tests. It should be kept as consistent as possible."
7573,0,"Patch Set 7:> ""allowNulls"", the design of the state system is that there should be no null values when returning from a query. It's not explicitely enforced in the backends' runtime code, but it could be. Testing this means testing cases that are not supposed to happen.When used along with a StateSystem, the query does not return null because the StateSystem first fills the interval list with a subset of the intervals and the backend fills it with the remaining subset, and both subsets complete each other and are mutually exclusive. So it is perfectly valid and expected in our runtime implementation that a backend does not fill some of the elements in the interval list. I could easily foresee test cases asserting that some elements must be null in the result of a query. These assertions could be checked after executing testDoQuery() which should therefore complete without failing.> The two ""abstract"" methods (getBackendForBuilding/getBackendForQuerying). The concept of ""reopening"" only applies to the HistoryTreeBackend, this notion should remain in that test class, not in the -Base. Parameters and the ""reopen"" constructor parameter is a nice way to offer both alternatives.Any backend could support reopening and then should override getBackendForQuerying(). Those backends that don't support it don't have to do anything. I think this is perfectly fine. My solution has the advantage to reduce code duplication. In the context of unit test code, I believe this is more important than conceptual considerations.> The abstract method I'm suggesting tells the implementation to ""create a backend and insert these intervals"". This is a clear initialization step.This clear initialization method is implemented in a final protected method that performs these steps in the base class in my patch. I think it is much better.> The pattern of an abstract method to set a protected field is used in other tests. It should be kept as consistent as possible.I hope you are not suggesting that forcing all subclasses to implement a method that can more easily be provided by the base class is preferable for reasons of consistency.I therefore respectfully disagree with your remaining objections. I think this patch is now way, way above the review threshold for unit test code. Thank you for your constructive feedback along the way."
7574,0,"Patch Set 4:Alex, I'm ready to merge it tomorrow (friday) at 4:00 pm. I consider these tests to be elegant and adequate. You can speak up or propose (in another patchset) an alternative. We could also test in two ways."
7575,0,"Patch Set 4:(8 comments)Looking good. Having both the -Base and a HistoryTreeBackendTest separates nicely what is specific to all backends (like the backend fixture), while HistoryTreeBackendTest owns what is specific to that backend, like the temp file.Good idea about splitting testDoQuery too, it will make it easy to re-use for different interval sets.I'd keep InMemoryBackendTest for another patch. We could move the tests in that class into the new base class to have them run on other backends.I'd also prefer to stick it to one abstract class that sets the backend. This pattern is used in other test classes in the tree. Each test would have to run prepareBackend(something), but then they don't have to worry about disposing it.New patchset inc."

7638,1,"Patch Set 8:> Just to add to Dani's, if the option works if > number of lines separating the groups <= no of blank lines to be > preservedYeah, but that's not clear to the user, especially since out of the box we only preserve 1 line.This new options directly depends on the number of preserved blank lines. Any value bigger than the preserved lines is not working as the user might expect.Some possible solutions:1. Remove the power to specify the number of lines that define a group. Just use a boolean that tells whether to group if there is at least one blank line.2. Only allow a number that is not bigger than the number of preserved lines.

7748,1,Patch Set 1:This change should resolve the problem of compatibility with the Eclipse Infocenter.I moved the intro content from the infra.doc bundle to the uml.diagram.wizards bundle because that one actually provides the action that is contributed to the Welcome dashboard.

7757,1,"Patch Set 2:Brian: (My apologies for the inappropriate ""Alex"") I checked now also the project eclipse.platform.runtime out which seemed to solve my startup problems and I can now run my test program. Two relevant observations from my Windows 7 machine:(a) The tool bar contribution (""Task!"") runs now and triggers the system task bar as expected. This fixes my most serious concern in regard to honoring the IProgressConstants2.SHOW_IN_TASKBAR_ICON_PROPERTY flag.(b) I can confirm that the system task bar is *not* yet triggered during the RCP startup process, there exists two reasons for this:(b.1) Previous 3.x Workbench code did enter in WorkbenchAdvisor.openWindows() a different code branch, because the lineIStatus status = myConfigurer[0].restoreState();could give a not-OK-status, this is no longer possible, because now WorkbenchConfigurer.restoreState() *always* returns OK_STATUS.(b.2) Now Workbench.createAndRunWorkbench does not wrap the splash handlers progress monitor using TaskBarDelegatingProgressMonitor.(b.3) My test program omits to set SHOW_PROGRESS_ON_STARTUP=true in the plugin_customization.iniTherefore my action items for this week end are:- Upload an improved test program that ensures that the startup presents progress on startup- Try to fix the second unwrapped progress monitorMy most serious concerns for this issue are fixing to honor IProgressConstants2.SHOW_IN_TASKBAR_ICON_PROPERTY. If I fail to complete my tasks during that weekend I would suggest to split the missing startup progress report using the system task bar into a second issue. Does that sound like a feasible approach?"
7759,0,Patch Set 5: Code-Review+2 Verified+1Thanks Daniel!
7778,0,"Patch Set 1:Sure, I've always had fun with bit banging! This is all too explicit for the commit message though.Ok, you start and you have a state, these states are bitmasks... the bitmask therefore can have 2 or N states at once.An example EXIT_TRACE == EXIT_ZOMBIE | EXIT_DEAD would not qualify as EXIT_DEAD... even though it should.with a switch, you would be forced to enumerate the powerset of the N values, so 1024 possible cases... this is not super testable.So we can check each bit one at a time. To do that, we make individual masks. A mask is a simple 1 shifted to the right position. Then you BITWISE and function between the said mask and the value. If this is 0, it means the bit was not present.I will update the commit message with an example, but I don't want to be this verbose in there unless you think it's necessary."
7779,0,"Patch Set 1:Yeah I understand bitmasks and such, thanks for the explanation though! :)Indeed, if these states are ""flags"", which means more than one can be active at the same time, it'd be better to use masks than a case/switch.I'm just saying the patch should be clear about what behaviour is being changed here.

Could be an easy (re-use, subset) one, though.You're right -- this entire bundle isn't needed if org.eclipse.osgi.services can be used. I just have to figure out how to add that package (and only that package) to the permanent build path.

7980,1,"Patch Set 1:> does it work instead by adding it do the tycho-eclipserun dependencies?It's not the tycho-eclipserun goal that fails, it's the ""generate-documentation"" one, which uses maven-antrun-plugin.(Btw there is still a warning about ""task.properties cannot be found"", but I think that's due to the tycho-eclipserun goal, since we don't define compile_classpath for that one. However since the build.index target doesn't need that property so it doesn't break anything).Unless you are talking about adding a <dependency> block like the others that are already there for the maven-antrun plugin? As far as I can tell these are ""base Maven"" dependencies, not p2 ones. The wikitext.core.ant we need is in a p2 repo. I did find some wikitext stuff in Maven central, but it's at version 0.9.something so I'm guessing this is just a very old version we shouldn't use anymore."

8017,1,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1The cache activation in Neon might impact all CNF users and not only Sirius. I think the change should be documented and also the fact that if a triggerPoint/possibleChildren expression uses propertyTester which are dynamic, CNF extenders will have to listen to their changes in order to invalidate the cache. This appear like a regression to us: we use a CNF extension point and nothing tells us that property tester cannot be dynamic. When we use  org.eclipse.ui.menus extension point, there is nothing to do to keep this dynamic aspect of property tester(used in visibleWhen expressions for example)I still wonder if this a good idea to cache test expression results and ask implementers/extenders to invalidate the cache. Might you decide to invalidate the cache on refresh/update of the CommonViewer ? Then between to update/refresh, the test evaluation result should be consistent and stay cached."

8537,1,"Patch Set 6:> I think unless we have docs stating that it, for safety we should > assume there is one true instance.The doc for setAccessible() states that it sets the accessible flag  ""for *this object*"", not for the reflected object.This developerworks article on reflection [1] says that the setAccessible method ""lets you turn the access checks on or off for an *instance* of one of these classes"" (i.e. Constructor, Field, and Method). > Otherwise why would anybody bother with restoring the accessible flag?Interestingly, I couldn't find any reference that recommends restoring the accessibility state. Maybe it was just a misconception.Moreover, the fact that you could write a set of unit tests that show the actual effect of setAccessible, and the central role of this method in the reflection API, makes me think that any change in this regard would be a breaking change.

WorkingTreeIterator then tries read those 14 bytes, but gets only 11 from FileTreeIterator.openInputStream because that normalizes back to NFC.

Yuck.Not sure what's the best way to deal with this, especially since doing """"ln -s ├ñ├®├╝.txt link.txt"""" on the command line produces a link with on-disk size of 10 bytes, so it evidently is in NFC, not NFD."""

10006,1,Patch Set 2:> Tree and Table being the most performance sensitive widgets - resizing on every scroll even is a clear no go.In my opinion resizing/repainting on every scroll event won't significantly affect performance.It affects only visible items and their number isn't significant.I have tested the following:- Snippet144 from bug 129457 - the snippet from bug 124965#c2- http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.ui.git/tree/examples/org.eclipse.jface.snippets/Eclipse%20JFace%20Snippets/org/eclipse/jface/snippets/viewers/Snippet029VirtualTableViewer.java- http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.ui.git/plain/examples/ignificantlyorg.eclipse.jface.snippets/Eclipse%20JFace%20Snippets/org/eclipse/jface/snippets/viewers/Snippet030VirtualLazyTableViewer.java- the eclipse.platform.swt project in the Git History view (this project contains 24000+ commits)There isn't a difference in performance between GTK3 with and without the patch as well as between GTK2 and GTK3.Do you know any other examples to test table/tree performance?BTW I have removed the part of the patch related to bug 466499 because the table from Snippet144 isn't shown when it is included.

10387,0,"Patch Set 9: -Code-ReviewPatch set 9 of JDT/UI with patch set 15 of JDT/Core seems to work fine for substring completion in methods. Substring completion for fields may need proposal relevance adjustments. Dani can provide his feedback on the same.Before JDT/Core patch review, please complete the work on substring completion in types and fix the failing tests.Question/suggestion for JDT/UI patch:I saw that you added the validation check for camelCaseMatch also along with substringMatch.As I understood during the code-walkthroug, you are setting all other proposals (except substring proposals) to be suffix proposals in JDT/Core. Then why was camel case also not set as suffix proposal?In a similar way, there could be some other existing type of proposal or one that could be implemented later, which may need to be handled similar to camelCaseMatch while validation.Hence, as I had suggested during code walk-through, I feel it would be better if you have the property as substringProposal instead of suffixProposal, which would be specific to your feature and will be set only for substring proposals. Then you can check for coreProposal.isSubstringProposal() in JDT/UI and call substringMatch for that, while leaving rest of the code as it is.Please check the above approach and let me know if there is any problem with that."

We can check that once the above issue is fixed. Also, pattern highlighting in the proposal will be very useful with this feature. Please check if it is simple to implement. Otherwise, we can do that later."""
10394,1,"Patch Set 8:Gabor, please make sure that with your next patch sets, all the issues mentioned in previous comments are addressed properly and nothing is broken wrt the existing functionality.

The list is not filtered and still shows all the proposals with """"c.e"""".* No proposals are suggested with content assist after """"c.ent""""."""
10397,1,"Patch Set 12:I have fixed the minor issues with the Copyright notices and also reworked the validation of substring matches in a similar way how camel case matches are validated. During the latter, I've found that the camel case validation is done in isValidPrefix() and isPrefix(). This is confusing since the token is only a prefix if camel case and substring is disabled. I suppose, the names were chosen before support for camel case matching was added. For now, I have updated Javadoc to reflect how validation is done but have not touched the method names since that change would affect subclasses as well. However, I consider that renaming these methods to isValidToken() and isMatching() is something similar would make their roles more clear to future contributors."
10398,0,"Patch Set 12:(1 comment)Thanks, Gabor. The code changes look good now.About using ""token"" instead of ""prefix"" in method names and Javadocs, you are right. But let us keep the method names and Javadocs same as before as of now i.e. you can revert the Javadoc changes. We can modify that together with method names if we plan to do so. In one way, ""prefix"" can in general refer to the token used for invocation of content assist, though invocationToken is more appropriate. We can deal with it later."

It would be cleaner to incorporate the necessary changes directly into the EMF code generation step somehow, instead of generating code and immediately patching it.- The XML modification completely changes the format of the XML file regarding white spaces, since it re-exports the entire DOM.- The detection of the correct files happens by checking whether the URI fits the format <something>/plugion.xml and <something>/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF.

11469,1,"Patch Set 4:Matthew, the problem is that the ust trace type is not available in this plugin. This test would have to be in lttng.ust.ui.swtbot.tests.By default if you just use Debug/Run As in Eclipse, it includes ALL your plugins in your Target Platform and workspace, which is why it finds the UST trace type. Maven only loads the plugin dependencies. If you want to emulate that in Eclipse, you have to go in your debug configuration and remove the plugins that are not dependencies of tmf.ctf.ui.swtbot (it's easier to just remove everything tracecompass, add tmf.ctf.ui.swtbot and click Add Required). If I do that, I can reproduce the failures in Eclipse."
11488,1,"Patch Set 24:The index of the toolbar buttons being clicked were wrong so I changed the code to get the buttons by using the tooltip text. This should be less error prone.Before, this worked most of the time because, depending on timing, the next/back buttons could fall on an event with the same call stack. Most of the time it was actually so quick that it should not even have time to select a different event. I changed testGoToTimeGoBackAndForthAndCheckStack to make sure that it waits for the expected event to be selected and also so that it checks the call stack at every step (prev/next event). There is no API to access the current selected event in the Call Stack view so I thought the next best thing was to inspect the selected event in the table.After those changes, the test is not flaky anymore on my machine (100 times)."

It's the branch that always points to the latest release.

I found a couple more issues:* click next comment* click in compare editor* the comment should close, but it remains openCtrl+enter should save without inserting a new line.Also, I think we should change the criteria for when the popup can be closed, if we can. Instead of preventing it from closing whenever there is any text in the text area, can we prevent it from closing whenever there are unsaved changes in the text area? So if I click on a draft comment and don't change what's there, it should close if I click outside the popup, and if I click on a draft and delete all the text in the editor, the popup should remain open. Don't bother if this is non-trivial - I'd rather get this in in it's current form and change that later."

Also while the editor is open, it will not switch over to other drafts upon clicking them.To reflect these changes, we are now using a Multimap to represent the open and editable dialogs.

The simplest solution would be to add a second key binding but the problem is that when we do so, we never know which one of the shortcuts will appear in the Inspect action label (Eclipse do not care about the order of key bindings while loading them).

13143,1,"Patch Set 8:This is a snark free reply, to me this is really sweeping the problem under the rug. If we're going to fix this, it should be fixed. :("
13145,1,"Patch Set 8: Code-Review-1If we go back to the beginning, the goal of handling the arbitrary array types in here was to take responsibility for the value's implementation of equals().The technically correct way of doing things would have been of letting the value types implementing their own equals(). But by consolidating the functionality in here, it would simplify every sub-class.However the more we go on, the more I/we see the limitations of the current approach. So I'm starting to think maybe we should go back and do things the ""correct"" way after all. This would mean that every single class in CtfTmfEventField would have to implement their equals() and hashCode(), which will easily double their size, but at least the overall design will be cleaner."
13148,1,"Patch Set 9:After discussing some more with Matthew, we agreed on the following approach: go with the current ugly checking of all array types in TmfEventField#equals() for now to cover our own implementations, but don't cover multi-dimensional arrays. I also added a note in getValue()'s javadoc to that escient.However, in the mid-term we will rework all our CtfTmfEventField implementations to not use primitive arrays but rather Collections. Guava ArrayBackedList(?) was proposed. This might take some time to do, as it will require performance profiling etc. Once/if that is done, we can remove the array-type checking in TmfEventField, defer to values' .equals(), and extend the note to also include any type of arrays."
13149,1,"Patch Set 9: Code-Review-1With this patch the contract of hashCode() is not respected.I submitted a patch https://git.eclipse.org/r/52187 which adds utility methods that, I believe, covers all the cases (null, arrays, collections or arbitrary objects, recursively). It could be used by this patch with the arbitrary Object values of TmfEventField.Also, I'm still not convinced that the getters need to be changed to final."
13150,0,"Patch Set 9:> With this patch the contract of hashCode() is not respected.Hmm true, if we use primitives array values, it's possible for equals to return true yet have different hashCodes.> I submitted a patch https://git.eclipse.org/r/52187 which adds utility methods...Interesting, this could cover for all possible types of values (as memory allows). I feel much more comfortable having this checking code in a separate utils class that is tested independently. I will try to rebase this commit on top of that one.> I'm still not convinced that the getters need to be changed to final.I'm still not convinced that the getters should be extensible ;)Every interface we expose means more potential behaviour we have to support, test and maintain. If we decide we want to support extending getFields() and getFieldNames(), we should have tests that cover for these cases (this applies to many many other places in the framework...)I have yet to see a clear use case of a sub-classes not using fFields and needing to extend these methods."

One last thing:> Because the iteration order is undefined, it can be different for> two sets that contain the same elements (e.g. LinkedHashSet with> different insertion order).If the standard equals() method says that such two sets are not equal, why should we override this behavior?"
13217,0,"Patch Set 4:> It seems *Set.equals() already take care of their implementation details, so in our Utils method here we can rely on it.We can't use Set.equals() because it does not do a deep equals on the elements, so it won't work if the set contains arrays.> Also, LinkedHashSet is not a SortedSet. SortedSet/NavigableSet is for things like TreeSet, where the elements are sorted as they are inserted. These will also be equal no matter their insertion order, more intuitively.We must use the special 'Set' code for HashSet and LinkedHashSet. We could use it also for SortedSet, but for SortedSet we can get away with using the 'Collection' code because the iteration order is known and it is the faster code of the two."
13218,1,"Patch Set 4: Code-Review+2 Verified+1Ok, after explanation, I get that we want to handle Set differently because AbstractSet.equals() does not check element positions, but contains().

At this moment, a snapToHelper is created with all necessary informations.Also, I do not understand the activation or not of LinkLF, as it is initialized to false, but you force it to true at execution time.

Do you prefer that you do all the changes, or should I also help with some patchsets?- we should aim to keep the API part consistent (naming) with the rest of MAT API. There are some inline comments related to this- copyright headers - All files should have copyright headers. I could add them. It would be however good if you can add yourself to the list of authors in the files which weren't just renamed/copied. Or in all. Shall I do this change, or you do it?-code formatting: I don't really remember how, but years ago we ended up with our own way of formatting the code. While I don't see this as a good idea, I would like to have all code of MAT formatted the same way. We are using this one: http://www.eclipse.org/mat/dev/mat_code_formatter.xml.

I hope you would send us further patches if you notice we've overseen something in the review process, or if you have other ideas."
14356,1,"Patch Set 3:I think the only other concern I has was exception handling. There are quite a few places where SnapshotException is caught, and it is either wrapped in a RuntimeException or reported as an error.In some cases we have to do one of those since the catching method cannot throw a checked exception, but we should make sure that the choice of throwing SnapshotException, wrapping in RuntimeException, or reporting the error is correct.In general, is the approach that ""user facing"" things like queries should report errors, but that ""code facing"" things like the collection extraction API should throw exceptions?There are some places where the existing query code catches SnapshotException and reports an error, but since the logic is now pushed inside the collection extraction API it throws a runtime exception and the query no longer catches it (e.g. CollectionFillRatioQuery). This means that previously there would be an error reported to the user but it would now lead to an uncaught RuntimeException.If we wanted to not wrap in RuntimeException, basically every method that does not implement an existing API would need to throw SnapshotException since implementing code may want to call another method that does. Even then, the code implementing an existing API like Iterator would still have to wrap SnapshotException in RuntimeException."
14357,0,"Patch Set 3: Code-Review+1Unless we wanted to alter the exception handling (I'd originally thought ""I'll fix that later""), I'm fine to have it committed - we can fix any bugs as they arise.I think it would still be a good idea to allow other plugins to add supported collections (via an extension point), but since I've lost my code to do that I'll have to re-write it. That won't break any API just add some more, so that is fine to do later for next year's releases."

The method name is isEditable(etc), and it is now returning 'true' when in fact it cannot be edited. Not only does it not make sense on the code level, I will also have several launch descriptors where even the idea that it could be edited will be confusing to a user.  And finally, I think popping up dialogs for situations we already know won't work doesn't make sense. I don't like the idea of putting an error decorator on the gear. This implies the descriptor SHOULD be editable, but something is wrong, and so it cannot. This is not the case for my descriptors. There's nothing wrong with them. They simply cannot be edited. Launch configs with no tabs defined do not have an error. They are simply not editable."

But you are right that it could be nice for the single process case.  We could look into an enhancement to show the exited process node even after GDB dies. I suggest we do that separately.  Note that the exit code is still visible in the title of the console in that case (as long as the process exited on its own).  > * I like this additional way to restart the terminated process from > the same session :-)Me too :)  But of course, that can only work if GDB is kept alive. > * Using the setting to ""Automatically debug forked process"" and > getting a small program which sequentially creates child forked > processes, don't preserve the exit code for all children but one. > This may be related to the collision of re-used group ids.Thanks for doing that test.  I see the same thing now.  The reason is that GDB deletes old inferiors in that case; I'm not sure why.  I'll look more into it."
15190,0,Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1I've investigated things in GDB and saw that when using fork() GDB tries to cleanup old inferiors.  I wasn't aware of that and this patch had made the assumption that this didn't happen.I will post an updated version.Thanks for trying this case!

It was a lousy copy-paste from my side.As for the approach to this I don't think I clearly understand what you mean. We need this to run also on startup and on theme change and this is OS-specific. Do you have some pointer in the code where we are doing something similar with CSS handlers? I'll also investigate myself in the meantime."
15328,1,"Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1(3 comments)I think this new element provider will conflict.  We already have an SWTElementProvider that provides a ShellElement for Shell.  RegistryElementProvider looks for the first provider that handles the widget type.The property name should be prefixed since is-dark isn't an standard CSS property. ""eclipse-is-dark"" or ""theme-is-dark""?I'd say this should be a fragment hosted on org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt rather than org.eclipse.ui.workbench since this seems applicable to pure E4 apps.You could still use the theme-changed event approach and still use a CSS property: see CSSRenderingUtils#getCSSValue() for an example."
15331,1,"Patch Set 5:Lars: we prefix anything that isn't a standard CSS property.  So we have 'swt-' and 'eclipse-' prefixes.

I agree that this is out of scope for > this bug. Please open a new bug for this.Will do. Basically when you go through IEB (not EventAdmin) the data object is put in the dictionary with the key IEventBroker.DATA. This causes the type-sensitive injection of the event payload.ThemeEngine#sendThemeChangeEvent does not bother to do it so the injection fails.
15338,1,"Patch Set 8:The @EventTopic for THEME_CHANGED definitely works: it's how the PartRenderingEngine listens for theme changes (see PartRenderingEngine#subscribeCssThemeChanged).I suspect the problem is that in the debugger you're not explicitly specifying a run-level for org.eclipse.equinox.ds and so it is being started after we've run the processors.  As a result the EventObjectSupplier/EventTopic service isn't being resolved, and thus the event listener isn't being registered.This is kinda annoying, so I'm fine with the explicit registration here."

What exactly are you proposing to have on the CSS? Also which kind of ElementAdapter are you thinking of as the CompositeElement and so on are for specific widget properties AFAIK and not for overall settings like ""being dark"" or not. Or are you thinking of having a new type ElementAdapter altogether?The examples you point at are directly related to processing properties of SWT widgets like font, background color etc. but this does not fit into those as it's a ""global"" setting."
15354,1,"Patch Set 3:Let me explain the reset functionality. Before 4.4. if you applied a theme and afterwards another theme all stuff that was not overriden in the new theme remained styled as in the first theme. That was annoying and therefore we had this ""Restart"" warning in the Preference dialog (which you implemented).In 4.4. we introduced the ""reset to default"" functionality. If you switch from theme A to B, everything would be set to ""default"" and afterwards everything would be styled accordingly to B. This allows new themes to control everything without side effects from older themes. Please note that we still have a few bugs in the reset stuff, e.g., Form controls do not all support the reset functionality.So in your case, if I switch from one theme to ""Something else"" all styling must be resetted to the default, e.g., preferences, colors, etc. As you are now argue this reset requirement away for the OS settings in this review, we also tried to argue that away for the preferences but this was strongly requested by the JDT team."

I went with this structure for a couple reasons:- The functionality could be added to other platforms in the future.- The handling of VM args is completely handled in the eclipse.c, so I added this along side to make it simpler.- The eclipseCarbon.c seems to be really focused on code that interacts with OS primitives. Also in order to do the handling of VM args in this file, it would have required functions to be exported from eclipse.cFinally the changes to eclipse.c are necessary because the previous code that was handling the appendage of VM args was incorrect. Basically the code assumed that user specified VM args were passed into the run function, but when no user VM args exist then the eclipse.ini vm args were passed in. The fix I did makes sure that only the user VM args are ever passed to the run function."

Are there such tests to check performance in hudson already?"
15743,0,"Patch Set 1:Having automated performance would be great ... but up to know I was not able to create stable performance tests which work on all the supported platforms. E.g. Windows & Linux differ much when it comes to filesystem performance, filesystem timers have different granularity, etc. I gave up on automating this and do it manually. I personally use the linux repo or some really huge internal repos for performance checks. And I most of the time just compare the performance to the predecessor commit.I was thinking what could be introduced in that area is that JGit publishes (e.g. as MBeans) some counters (number/size of working tree contents read, number of pathes visited in treewalks, number of pathes where content merge was triggered, number of pushes/fetches). AFAIK this doesn't cost anything if the published values are not read but would allow to do better validations if e.g. EGit is slow."

15940,0,"Patch Set 1:The reason why the read-only state of resources wasn't being cached at all in the scenario of showing the context menu in the Model Explorer is because the vast majority of accesses to the read-only manager were to query the read-only state of a resource directly, not indirectly via an EObject contained in the resource.  That was the only API that was cached before:  read-only state of a model element.So, the first major change in this patch is to additionally cache the read-only state of resources in the FSReadOnlyHandler, itself.  This was easily and safely done by a minor refactoring of the AbstractReadOnlyHandler to make the cache available to subclasses.However, this was not sufficient because the cache was actually always a no-op in the context-menu scenario.  The problem here is that caching was only active during the scope of a transaction in the read-only manager's editing domain.  However, the vast majority (if not all) of the read-only queries in the context-menu scenario are done without a transaction.  And even if they were done in a transaction, each and every one probably would have had its own transaction, nullifying any cache and probably making performance a bit worse by always setting up and tearing down the cache machinery.So, the second major change in this patch is to eliminate the cache's tie to transactions.  Now, the cache is implicitly initialized when read-only state is queried and is purged in an async exec (abstracted through an injected Executor).  This fixes the read-only part of the performance problems in the context menu.A bit of work was needed to fix the read-only JUnit tests, by injecting a custom executor that the tests can use to control when the cache is purged to force re-calculation of read-only state of resources as they change state.  Note that the read-only manager's makeWritable(...) API still *synchronously* purges the cache as before, so the make-writable use cases should still work (which is born out by the tests, actually)."

This or having a ""QuarkNotFoundException"" to be symmetrical with AttributeNotFoundException.However, the quark ints should always come from another getQuark... method, and those should always return valid ones (""Quark"" would have been a typedef, if Java offered such a thing). So if one somehow passes an invalid quark, it's because they're doing something wrong in the program.Whereas with getQuark*(), the input is usually arbitrary strings, so these may or may not exist (hence a checked exception).I did not think about it at first, but right now we do the polymorphism trick of adding the ""throws AttributeNotFoundException"" only to the ITmfStateSystem sub-interface.

16463,1,"Patch Set 1:Sorry for the delay. I uploaded a small example at http://www.mathematik.uni-marburg.de/~strueber/henshin_container_example.pngIn the meta-model underlying this example, ""club"" and ""player"" are EOpposite containment/container references. Consequently, both rules in this example have the same effect, which includes the removing and adding of the Player at a different place in the containment hierarchy (potentially a different model instance). However, B does not indicate this effect in the graphical syntax, which makes it difficult for the developer to understand the meaning of this rule.In a small example, the maintainability drawback might not be too drastic. But imagine that the meta-model might be complex and, worse, evolving over time. In an earlier version of the meta-model, Players might have been contained somewhere else, so that Version B actually meant something different at that time. In this case, the warning should definitively make sense."

16650,0,"Patch Set 10:Regarding : > old-old stuff like VariableManager> not-so-old stuff like AbstractInterpreter (introduced to share common code for var:/feature:/service:)> new code introduced here in AcceleoAbstractInterpreter and AQLSiriusInterpreter.I'll have a look, but that would likely involve breaking the IInterpreter API, would that be ok for you ? Or defining an IInterpreter2 ?I did some performance measures and the Variable management introduce some noticeable overhead when refreshing a big diagram, about 25% of the time is spent in set/unset variables which is done X times, X being the number of interpreters which are declared, whereas passing the variable current state in the interpreters sound easy enough.If you agree I would do that in a separate changeset (and dedicated bugzilla)"
16657,1,"Patch Set 8:Yes, I wasn't arguing that the code is wrong, but I'd expect that if we create 40 new instances each time and never dispose them (unless the 2 fixed by this change), then it looks like we have a bigger problem elsewhere."
16659,1,"Patch Set 10:Dani, I've filed bug 460523 for leaked(?) CommandContributionItem's.Can we proceed with this review?"
16661,1,"Patch Set 9:CommandContributionItem's aren't disposed even on window.close()...I did some experiments and tried for example dispose CommandContributionItem's on CoolBarToTrimManager.dispose(). The funny thing is that some of the most prominent buttons disappeared from the main window toolbar after closing CustomizePerspectiveDialog - save, debug, external tools etc.It looks like if there is some magic behind. So it is definitely not clear for me who is responsible for disposing created CCI's and how the new CCI instances created *for CPD only* are connected to the already existing buttons on the main toolbar. One need to spend much more time in the debugger or to RTFM how this is supposed to work. But WHERE ARE THE MANUALS???"
16662,1,"andIt looks like the CommandContributionItems either aren't in the corresponding managers, or, they got removed before the manager gets disposed."""

16818,0,Patch Set 2: Verified+1Works great!
16839,1,"Patch Set 1: -Code-ReviewAnyway, I won't nak this patch only because of a list implementation. It just seems silly to not use a linked list in what is a textbook example of when to use one."
16840,1,"Patch Set 1:I think that linked lists are more attractive in textbooks than in reality ;) In Java's LinkedList you don't have access to the node element, so inserting an object at a specific position requires iterating through, on average, a quarter of the list.But the main reason I dislike LinkedList over ArrayList is that it's much more annoying to follow in the debugger. So when other factors have negligible impact I'll pick ArrayList every time."
16841,1,"Patch Set 1:> so inserting an object at a specific position requires iterating through, on average, a quarter of the listBut inserting in the middle of an Array list requires rewriting the whole rest of the list! And in worst cases, re-allocating and rewriting the whole list.> it's much more annoying to follow in the debuggerThat's a good concern. It's something the debugger could improve. In fact, it should show the contents of all Collections in a more straightforward way."
16842,0,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1Now unrelated to the list, but can this class be accessed by multiple threads? Now it's exposing various methods on a bare list with no synchronization, is it safe?-1 for question"
16843,1,"Patch Set 1:> Now unrelated to the list, but can this class be accessed by multiple threads? Now it's exposing various methods on a bare list with no synchronization, is it safe?It is indeed not safe if accessed by multiple threads. The known code that uses these methods only runs on the main thread, though.If we want to make it safe, it's not enough to use synchronization. The index returned by indexOf() might be wrong by the time addChild() is called. Either it has to be synchronized externally, or we have to replace these methods with the required atomic operations (addBefore, addAfter, moveUp, moveDown, etc...) and make those synchronized.This is just a merged patch being ported from Linux Tools to Trace Compass, though. I didn't plan to do any big design change. The class is internal, if that makes a difference."
16844,0,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1 Verified+1It's fine for a class to not be re-entrant, as long as it is known and ideally documented. If the current usage does not need it, it should be fine.Ok, nothing else to complain about!"
16862,1,Patch Set 2:(1 comment)I'll also update the 4.4 target. I missed that.
16863,0,"Patch Set 6: Code-Review+2 Verified+1Fixed the 2 small comments I had on PS5.Compiles on both targets, Control view hasn't broke, lgtm!"
16885,1,"Patch Set 1:I saw this. Many of potential NPE are reported on Sonar also.PDT very often have a problem with CA on EOF. Sometimes have also ton of workaround due simple BadLocationException. This also generate a lot of performance issues ;) Change looks safe. BTW: Eclipse Mars since M5 have built-in auto reporter, so we may expect a lot of NPE, BLE and similar exception reports :D"
16887,1,Patch Set 1:I'm afraid that students want working on new shiny features instead of maintain legacy code :P
16896,1,Patch Set 1:You might not want to commit api_changes.textiles which are so ugly yet ;)Please note that the latest build of the baseliner (from last night) now generates an api_changes.html which is way more readable.
16901,0,Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2 Verified+1Look good
16902,0,Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1Fix is good to be merged.
16962,0,"Patch Set 2: Verified+1 Code-Review+2Thanks, Mat!"
16965,0,"Patch Set 1:None as far as I can see. The class (PathEnvironmentVariable) is private and only used to contribute to the PATH environment variable when cross-compiling. The contribution is the path to the cross compiler you specify in your project settings. Normally that path is prepended. It normally works fine, unless you use say ${ARM_TOOL_PATH} which java.io.File does not understand. It assumes ${ARM_TOOL_PATH} is some form of weird folder name in cwd and hence prepends c:\program files\...\eclipse\bin resulting in a non-existing directory being added to the path. I can't image you'd want to use a relative path to your compiler. If relative, relative to what? Here's a few examples:Cross path: C:\myarmcompilerBefore: C:\myarmcompilerAfter: C:\myarmcompilerCross path: myarmcompilerBefore: C:\program files\Eclipse\myarmcompilerAfter: C:\myarmcompilerCross path: ${ARM_TOOL_PATH} (and ARM_TOOL_PATH=c:\mycompiler)Before: C:\program files\Eclipse\c:\mycompilerAfter: c:\mycompilerIf some user really depends on specifying the cross compiler relative to the eclipse bin dir, I suggest they use ${ECLIPSE_HOME}\myarmcompiler which is also a lot more explicit."

17042,1,"Patch Set 2:Then I'd argue we should mark them as deprecated.

If we don't want trace parsers that depend on native libraries in Trace Compass that's fine but we don't have to prevent people from doing it as an extension. Also, I don't think the fact that one would want to extend or replace the events table or the default editor is intrinsically related to the fact that one uses a native parser. In any case, the discussion of whether or not the extensions are useful and if they should be deprecated is out of the scope of this patch and would be best left out IMO."

17060,0,"Patch Set 2:I would have thought that we have designed the framework to support events without timestamps. However, 1) there are a lot of places where it is already assumed non-null that would throw a NullPointerException, 2) even custom parsers where timestamp is optional use TmfTimestamp.ZERO if none are defined.So perhaps we can make the jump to non-null timestamps. However, I would prefer if the default was ZERO instead of BIG_BANG, because the latter creates a odd value when represented as a string.Alternatively, perhaps even better, we could create a NULL constant that overloads toString() to return an empty string (and can't be normalized/offset?).Maybe we should revive Matthew's patch that creates special classes for these timestamp constants. https://git.eclipse.org/r/24880"
17061,1,"Patch Set 2:Seeing the code, indeed we could still support null value for timestamp at constructor (that would make this patch much smaller), but use TmfTimestamp.ZERO (or TmfTimestamp.NULL) for the @NonNull field. I didn't see the ZERO, alphabetical order made it very low in my autocomplete ;-), but it makes more sense than BIG_BANG."

17105,0,Patch Set 6:thanks for this nice contribution :-)Could you add a short section to the user guide [1] explaining how this can be used ? We generate the Eclipse documentation from that wiki.[1] https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide
17107,0,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1Adding strong dependency to JDT is a no go IMHO.The problem is that egit can be used in Eclipse installations without JDT.If the dependency is really needed and can't be avoided, it should be made optional and the related code should be written in the way that it can gracefully terminate if JDT classes aren't abailable. It can be done either with try/catch around related code oder with checks before if the related JDT bundle is available in the current system.Small small issues with the patch: - formatting is inconsistent (check especially the spaces around ""if"" conditions) - most external class names are written full qualified in the code which avoids imports and made the code not that readable - commit message format: we use ""Bug: number"" style."

17372,0,"Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1(2 comments)Now I like this better :)We were really talking about two different things, one being the whole ""content"" element of ITmfEvent, and the other being an individual field from the content. It makes sense to have two separate classes.So we're past the design comments, now on to the real comments ;)The class names of the two aspects are a bit confusing. I'd say the content aspect (the one now used in the BASE_ASPECTS) should be called TmfContentAspect (or TmfEventContentAspect?) And TmfEventFieldAspect should remain the ""singular"" one.The contents of https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/38512/6 are touched again by this patch.

We could make a specific subclass for the event.getContent() but I don't think it would add any value.TmfContentFieldAspect is specific to the event.getContent() (hence 'Content' in the name). But since it is not an instanceof TmfEventFieldAspect, it does not have the special UI in the filter viewer, which is what we want (there are not subfields in the BTF and GDB aspects that use it).> They could be squashed together, or maybe put that one after this patch hereDo you feel strongly about this?

That would avoid having to touch the existing implementations. One such aspect refers to one field, ""field aspect"" sounds like the correct name to me. While ""content field"" sounds more like a compound field.>> They could be squashed together> Do you feel strongly about this?No not really. But it's trivial to do with git rebase --interactive. Does EGit not support this? ;)"
17378,1,Patch Set 3:Hi Alex and PatrickPlease come to an agreement. This patch blocks several other patches and multiple bug fixes. Right now the FilterView is not working. I don't want to release Trace Compass 0.1.0 with a non-functional FilterView which is one of the core features of Trace Compass./Bernd/Bernd
17379,1,"Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1Is *this* patch *really* ""blocking other patches and multiple bug fixes""? Or is it just due to some strange refusal of merging anything in this branch without it?For instance, the *8* patches before this one were reviewed and approved previously, why were they not merged already?The Filter View was broken since before the event-aspect change. I don't understand how it HAS to completely take over the ITmfEventFieldAspect to work again. Can't it keep using the ITmfEventField API if it likes it so much?If it wants to use the aspect API, then it should fold to its known guidelines, or ""by-design limitations to keep complexity in check"". Not the other way around. As in, no sub-fields, no ITmfEventField.ROOT_FIELD craziness, and other things that make a simple Object getter much more complicated than it should be."
17380,1,"Patch Set 3:We get that you're not a fan of ITmfEventField, but it's there. CTF uses it, PCAP uses it, the Properties view for events uses it. It can't be removed without providing an alternative way to generically support an hierarchy of fields and sub-fields.This patch allows any aspect to support an hierarchy. But considering only the existing case of the event contents, the patch allows the field filter to be specified directly on the visible 'Contents' aspect instead of exposing a generic 'Event field' aspect to the user, who doesn't have to guess that the field applies to and only to the internal event content. It is an improvement for the user experience.As for migrating the filter viewer to event aspects, that is a huge improvement as it removes the old ugly solution that used special field id strings for base event members, and required a trace event type to provide its possible fields in a dummy root event field given by the empty event type constructor. It also allows for filters on any event member that is neither a base event member or a sub-field of the event content member. Keeping the filter viewer based on event fields is not a sound alternative.I think the solution is neither crazy nor overly complex. I find it quite elegant actually. You want an event field aspect based on any ITmfEventField, you provide a way to access that ITmfEventField, and an optional field or sub-field string."
17381,1,"Patch Set 3:> We get that you're not a fan of ITmfEventField, but it's there.> CTF uses it, PCAP uses it, the Properties view for events uses it.Yet, none of these required adding a bunch of unintuitive and seemingly-redundant methods to TmfEventFieldAspect (getField(), forField(), when we have a resolve() already; createAspect() when we have a public constructor already).I do think ITmfEventField in general is redundant with the aspect API, but you are right that right now ""it's there"", and that it's not going away anytime soon. But that doesn't mean we have to replicate all its APIs and functionalities in the TmfEventFieldAspect class. An aspect is supposed to be a singular ""quanta"" of information from an event. A TmfEventFieldAspect is supposed to represent a single field from a event. Not a way to access all the fields of an event, that's what ITmfEvent#getContent is for.That being said, I don't think it's helpful to keep arguing our little points here. It is merely a symptom of a bigger ""design clash"" underneath. We should have a big discussion with everyone and decide where we want to go with the event fields, the event aspects, the filters, etc.For now, I would suggest that the rest of the branch goes in, and that a less invasive solution is investigated to retrieve event fields."

17541,1,"Patch Set 1:I wasn't aware that sub-fields are supposed to be removed.

17543,0,"Patch Set 1:I think the event content and the event field aspect are useful as they allow for searchable fields that are determined only by the trace data and not its definition. For example it allows us to create a numerical compare filter on a specific CTF event field.If subfields are useful for PCAP, one of the few known extensions, it's not unreasonable to think that they can be useful for any of the unknown extensions.The event field aspect is a special case in the filter viewer, it is the only aspect that requires an additional user input (the field string). It's nice to be able to provide out-of-the-box support for subfields with that aspect. It wouldn't be as easy to have the extensions need to override or extend the filter viewer UI for special-case aspects."
17544,1,"Patch Set 1:Now that we have event aspects, the whole ITmfEventField interface is redundant. All queries for event information can go through aspects now.

But I really think this is something we should strive to.I'm also a bit skeptical about the usefulness of typing manually field paths with slashes. How would the user know which fields actually exist? Is it useful to someone other than those who wrote the parser? A big advantage of aspects is discoverability, it can tell the user which information exists for an event. Couldn't we ""unroll"" all the subfields and display a list to the user?"

17549,0,"Patch Set 2:(1 comment)> ... the trace data and not its definitionYou are still thinking of ""fields"" and ""aspects"" as two different layers. They can be the same. We are not poking at bits directly here, everything is a ""definition"". It's just a matter of ""what we've implemented to put stuff in ITmfEventField's"" vs ""what we've implemented to put stuff in event aspects"".We could (and eventually should) create aspects programmatically for each field found in a CTF event. This will avoid for example having CTF fields and CTF contexts be both considered as the same thing, while they are slightly different (the context aspects can be defined per channel/trace, the field aspects per event type, etc.)> The user can create the filter without any trace being selected.What is the point of that?? And how can the user create filters with no trace opened if he has to go look for field names in another view, which will be empty because no trace is opened?We are building a graphical tool, we're supposed to make the user's life easier. Like, reading what's in the trace, and offering what can be selected. Not having to have the user read field names in another view then re-type them manually elsewhere. A prepopulated drop-down list would be much more useful than an empty text box here.Anyways, if you really feel that typing subfield names manually is such a desirable feature, I won't nak this. (One small comment though.) In a sense TmfEventFieldAspect is just a shim between the new aspect API and ITmfEventField. If we ever get rid of the latter, then TmfEventFieldAspect will be unneeded too. So it doesn't really matter what bloat gets put in there in the meantime."

I was thinking that ""I'm feeling lucky"" (maybe should be ""Random Example"") could create a complex group based on the local vars and registers of the current session.  This aims at teaching the user what can be done; e.g.,=i;$eax;$xx*=topVar;*The ""Help"" would pop up an explanatory dialog giving examples.Maybe we don't both of those."
17772,1,"Patch Set 1:Ok I will move it to gdb, I was not sure where it is implemented. I will also would then do visibleWhen checkEnabled, so they don't show up at all when not available.Putting them in submenu also not a bad idea, but I don't know what happens to menu if non of its items active.""I am feeling Lucky"" is kind of lame. We don't usually put jokes like this in any other part of CDT, so it would be kind of weird. Help is also not a right thing to do in a menu. Eclipse has standard ways to provide help and it should just work. Btw if you want to more visiblity on syntax one place to put it is in Add Watch Expression dialog itself, is it ours or platform?"

17813,0,Patch Set 1:(9 comments)This looks great!
17820,1,"Patch Set 10: Verified-1- When you add a new package, you also have to add it to the manifest. I would name the package ""nested"" not ""nesting"", since you use the term ""nested"" at all other places.- The content provider name should be 'Nested Projects' (uppercase 'p')- I think you can set the radio state by using HandlerUtil.updateRadioState(event.getCommand(), VALUE); I think there is no API to listen to content provider enablement/disablement in the Customize dialog, but you can update the radio state when the content provider is created, and when it is disposed. Enabling/disabling the content provider when the menu state changes is a little bit more tricky. You'd probably have to use code similar to what's in org.eclipse.ui.internal.navigator.filters.CommonFilterSelectionDialog.okPressed().- I take the filtering change back - let's leave it unconnected. When we disable the Java content, we also keep the Java related filters (not optimal, but that's how it currently is).- Project Presentation: it should be in the same group as Package Presentation - we can leave this as is since we don't want to introduce a dependency on JDT.- dialog store vs. preference: if you want to set it via plugin_customization.ini, then I'm OK to use a preference - but not show it in the preferences dialog."
17821,1,"Patch Set 6:Thanks for the review. My comments/answers are prefixed with ""**"" Done:* We don't want fancy/new names like ""nastor"" in the code or UI. It looks like a product or brand name. Please replace it everywhere with e.g. ""nesting"" or ""nested"", and move the classes into the 'org.eclipse.ui.internal.navigator.resources.workbench' package.* ""and others"" in the copyright needs a dot* the content provider should not contain ""show"" in the name, just ""Nested Projects""* Project Presentation: the label needs mnemonic - suggest to use 'r'* Project Presetion - the sub-menu labels also need mnemonic ('F' and 'P')** -> I used 'F' and 'H' Still TODOs with questions/comments: * Project Presentation: it should be in the same group as Package Presentation  -> The 'label' group is contributed programatically by JDT UI. It's not easy to depend on it. * Out of the box the new content provider should not be selected. Only when toggling via menu or by the user, it should get (de-) selected accordingly.* The toggle action should also toggle the content provider, otherwise there will be strange things in the UI when the user (accidentally) disables the content provider.I would hard-wire the action and the content provider, i.e. if the user disables the content provider I would toggle the action to 'Flat'.** -> I like those 3 proposals. However, I don't know I could implement a good RadioState based on content provider activation. Do you have an example of how to do this? Or will I have to use programatic menu contributions to deal with selection? * Same applies to the filters. Here I'd even vote to not surface them in the UI, and do the filtering directly in the content provider. Otherwise, you also have to enable/disable them when toggling the menu.** -> What do you mean by ""filtering directly in the content provider"". I don't think CNF content provider provide a good way to do that. Do you have an example? * The content provider does not react to changes: 'Import as Project' does not let the new project appear, and deleting a nested project does not bring it back as folder. I have to press 'F5' to get the view refreshed.** -> That's indeed an issue. This feature should place a few more workspace/resource listeners to trigger refresh on project creation/deletion. There are already some for some cases, I'll have a look at the reported scenario. * The state of nesting should be stored as dialog setting and not as preference. Maybe this can even be computed by the enabled state of the content provider.** -> ok for persisting it as dialog settings. However, I'd like to keep the preference as a default activation of nested view of projects, so RCP apps could enable this by default from the plugin_customization.ini. Other TODOs:* The content provider does not have an icon."

18611,1,"Patch Set 3:> cruftAin't that a fun word? ;)> You can fix a missing null check but that cruft stays foreverNot technically forever. Once we move to Java 8, type annotations will also apply for generic types, for instance List<@NonNull String>, so all the List.get() methods will be able to return @NonNull things.And when/if the Java methods themselves are instrumented with standardized @NonNull annotations, all the .toString() and such will be able to return @NonNull objects directly.At these points, we will get ""unnecessary null check"" warnings, so we'll know where to remove all these extra checks.I dislike cruft too, but knowing it's cruft that one day will warn use when/where we can remove it, it eases my mind a bit. ;)"

18761,0,"Patch Set 4: Code-Review+1> What do you mean by ""String -> Integer -> String"".Yeeeaah, in my mind, the aspect was still using the old getSource(), which returned a String. But yes it's Integers all the way down now!Updated to latest branch. This is looking good!"
18763,0,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1Looks good. Obviously it will have to wait until the prerequisite patches are merged ;)Once we add the new IKernelTrace plugin, that interface could provide methods for all its get*Criterion, so we wouldn't need to iterate through all of them to find a specific one.Side note about criteria, I was thinking the resolve() method could instead return an Object, and every specific criterion type could return a more specific type. So a CpuCriterion.resolve() could return a Integer, which is slightly better than doing Integer.parseInt(String) if you just want to use the int value."
18764,0,"Patch Set 1:Indeed, returning an Object would make sense. But doesn't that sound real close to weak-typing to you? ;-)Anyway, for now, we only cases where criterion return a simple type that is easy to go back and forth from String, but in a not so remote future, the criterion might return... an analysis! or a state system! or another criterion!Remember that discussion we had a while ago about ""how to get data from an analysis"" and we suggested a stream of <something> like from ""trace A"", get ""analysis X"", get ""the state system"", get ""this path"". That <something> might be the criterion! Oh right, you just wanted to replace the table columns concept... :p"
18768,0,"Patch Set 3:What do you mean by ""String -> Integer -> String"". Actually, the aspect itself (CtfCpuAspect for instance) has the data directly as an int, so it returns an int, no cast. And though the attribute tree uses a String, most of the analysis code use the int value that can now be used without cast.It's the original resolve of the cpu that forced int -> String -> Integer.parseInt() when an Integer is required in code.

But then we should also set up a toolchain to make sure the build compiles against proper JRE version.Even longer answer:I think it's important to make sure we compile against a JRE matching our BREE, so no new JRE API sneaks in. MPC currently has a BREE of J2SE-1.5, but we should update that to JavaSE-1.6 for Mars, since we already have a lot of dependencies to bundles with BREE Java-1.6. We can't update to JavaSE-1.7 however, because MPC is part of all EPP packages and some have decided against a move to require 1.7 for now."

19172,1,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1This changeset contains changes to 3 files, 2 of them are non-functional changes unrelated to the issue at hand:- Changes in PapyrusPaletteService.java- Changes in XMLPaletteApplicator.javaWhile the changes in these two files are of interest for another reason I would recommend to submit them in another patch for the the support of i18n (or lack of in this case).Beware that FilteringPaletteProvider used to only proxy palettes providers of type DefaultPaletteProvider, and not the generic IPaletteProvider because it was not guaranteed to work on all GMF IPaletteProvider. This is important because the FilteringPaletteProvider is part of the public API (per Papyrus policy of having all publicly exposed component as part of the public API). This could induce false expectations from the user, especially if a custom user-defined provider does not support the way it is proxied.Indeed, the FilteringPaletteProvider have a peculiar way of using the proxied palette provider by resetting its contributions repeatedly (on line 260). This works for the DefaultPaletteProvider because we know the inner workings of this class, but this is not guaranteed to work on all IPaletteProvider. Note that relying on the knowledge of the inner workings of DefaultPaletteProvider is not a nice pattern ...Other mprovement track: Now that WalkerPaletteContributionHelper (in FilteringPaletteProvider.java) has non-static methods and uses instance fields, we could optimize its member (private) methods so that they do not instantiate a bunch of lists for nothing but all contribute to the same. We can do that by passing the resulting list as a parameter, or as an instance field.Side note regarding style: there are some trailing whitespaces in the contributed changes in FilteringPaletteProvider.java"

19235,1,Patch Set 1: Verified+1(3 comments)This looks very good.  The service is a nice solution to the problem of attaching the listener to the resource set!

19237,0,"Patch Set 2:(5 comments)Undo/redo works well.  Thanks!  It looks odd, though, that undo/redo changes the selection in the Model Explorer even when focus is currently in a diagram editor.  Especially if I have ""link with editor"" turned on in the explorer because in that case, the linking of the selection doesn't actually happen (which is a good thing, but looks like a bug).  I would expect the changed selection on undo/redo to be reflected in the diagram, but it isn't.  It's only selection changes caused by mouse or keyboard in the explorer view that are propagated to the diagram.Anyways, that can all be avoided simply by having the RevealResultCommand do its thing only if its view part is currently active.  That's actually better than what I suggested last time (I suggested then that the command should operate on whatever is the current view, but that would be bad, because that view may provide IRevealSemanticElement but not be the explorer, which would be confusing at best)."
19238,1,"Patch Set 2:(4 comments)Further to your comments, I modified the different labels before the minor changes sink to oblivion (or to transform into bug task).The issue about synchronisation with diagram, I didn't see generic solution which can publish event or something else to synchronise all selection listener (I confess I tried with view part's selection provider but nothing happens)."
19239,0,"Patch Set 1: Verified-1 Code-Review-1Redoing a new element creation that was undone does not select-reveal the (re)created element.I understand that we can't just do as an EMF-generated editor does and attach a command-stack listener that selects the affected objects of whatever was the last command executed/undone/redone, because it could have been a command in the diagram or other context that should not alter the Model Explorer selection.   So, the idea of the command wrapper is neat.However, the command-wrapper would be more reusable/safe if it didn't explicitly look for the Model Explorer view (maybe there are multiple instances of it!) but instead checked that the currently active view provides the IRevealSemanticElement protocol.  Also, it should account for selecting the object(s) affected by undo and redo.  In the case of redo, that's the same as execute, but in the case of undo, the affected object should be the one that the new object had been created in.Also, why select-reveal only the first result?  If multiple objects were created, I would expect all of them to be selected.  At least, this is how EMF-generated editors work."

But on further reflection, I think that would also be confusing, and seeing the impact of undo/redo on the model is useful whatever the context."

19559,1,"return result instanceof String && result != NULL_CONFIG ? (String) result : null;- initializeProperties(..) operates on a this.configuration that can already contain NULL_CONFIG values. The """"configuration.get(..)"""" calls were already unsafe with the non-String NULL_CONFIG. The """"configuration.getProperty(.."""") calls used to return null for NULL_CONFIG, but now they return the NULL_CONFIG. I think initializeProperties should be made non-static, and it should use getConfiguration(..) instead of a """"Properties configuration"""" parameter."""

19664,1,"Patch Set 27: Code-Review-1(6 comments)See my comments - I think it's a mistake to make the connector field of connectorUi mutable, even with the @noreference annotation, and I think it's unnecessary, since we can just provide a constructor that takes the connector as an argument."
19672,1,Patch Set 28:(9 comments)I think this is close! Sorry it took me a while to get back to it.
19677,0,Patch Set 20:If we can change the extension point reader to inject the core connector that seems like a good idea but I'm not sure we want to invest in creating that logic (rather than use something like guice). It seems to me that you need to deal with connector UIs having a null connector anyways in that case due to backwards compatibility so an initialize/setConnector() method seems more reasonable.

19868,1,Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1I've looked over this and currently this only deletes the temp files on a successful import. On an unsuccessful the temp files are lost on the server. These need to be removed.
19876,1,"Patch Set 1:If ""border"" property is defined in the theme XML file, all border edge properties *must* be defined too (border is only a shorthand of its four edges). This is currently the case in all our theme XML files. Probably, this is only a problem for custom *themeable* widget developers which create thier own theme XML files and need to know that ""border"" always needs its four edge properties.Instead excluding the ""border"" in ThemeDefinitionReader we could ""expand"" it to it's four edge properties. Is this better?"
19878,1,"Patch Set 1:My idea was to avoid the word ""shorthand"", as border-top and etc. are also shorthands. Specifying additional attribute in theme xml files is a good idea, but will be confusing because of that - border is marked as shorthand, but not border-top. But at the end I thing it's acceptable."

Specifying additional attribute in theme xml files is a good idea,> but will be confusing because of that - border is marked as shorthand, but not> border-top. But at the end I thing it's acceptable.Good point, I missed the fact that in the spec, border-top etc. are also shorthands. However, in our current model, they are not. If we ever implemented the terminals (border-top-style, etc.), border-top would also be marked as shorthand.Still I would like to avoid another term for the same concept."

PDT-Eg Core plugin use standard DLTK api to report problems during build.Example: class Test { public function x() {} }Now create unused variable inside x() method, save.Sometimes Test and x have a warning badge, sometime none have, sometimes only one have it.Next problem is a ModelException if file is not in build path."
20188,1,Patch Set 4:Yet another attempt;)I discovered that IImportContainer has source module as a parent not namespace. It forced me to add some additional code for finding imports container valid parent. Is this state is by design or it is inherited from DLTK api?
20189,1,Patch Set 4:Its by DLTK api (inherited from JDT).IImportContainer should have name as IPackageDeclaration.We are using IType to store namespaces (on bugzilla is a bug to migrate it IPackageDeclaration).See PHPSourceElementRequestor.

I removed this limitation. Now each marker that is sub-type of IMarker.PROBLEM is processed. I tested new version with semantic validation from Zend Studio and from PDT-Eg. I didn't encounter any problems. Sometimes I had situation that warning/error was displayed in editor, but there was no overlay in Outline and in PHP Explorer also so I think this is another issue.Which case exactly you were talking about when you mention ModelException? I added null checking for 'ISourceModule.getCorrespondingResource', but I'm not sure if this is problem you mentioned."

20262,1,"Patch Set 1:From looking into the changes in Gerrit there are two little things I would like to be modified:- there are whitespaces that should be removed. you can see them in the compare view.- you named the internal variables columnIndex and rowIndex. Although it doesn't has an impact, I would suggest to name those variables e.g. ""pos"" or ""columnPos"". I know we are in a IDataProvider where index == pos, but if somebody is looking into the sources it might be confusing using position and index in one method without transition.As said before, this is more about code cosmetic rather than functionality. From the functionality point it looks good. I will test that against several projects to verify that everything works well.BTW, are you able to create some test cases if there aren't any already? Or, if there are any, add some for your use case of huge dataset spanning?"

We have several JUnit test cases in the org.eclipse.nebula.widgets.nattable.core.test project.

20490,0,"Patch Set 14:(3 comments)Hi,The problem with the save as action was that the data binding contexts were not update when the editor input was changed.Because of this, after a save-as action, when a change was made to one of the fields (e.g. the name in the metadata page), the corresponding page was marked as stale instead of dirty, as the databindings were still observing the old snippet.I hope this makes sense. Anyway, I added listeners in each page that will take care of updating the db contexts and the snippet when the editor input changes."

20503,1,"Patch Set 5:(2 comments)Hi,I've been working on this change-set, but unfortunately I get an error when trying to push the changes to gerrit[2].Until I manage to solve it and push the code, I thought it's best to write some comments about the changes I made.I found this forum post [1] that describes a way to solve the dirty editor problems. Basically, we'll need to call the doSave() method for all the editor pages to remove their dirty status. After this, calling the editorDirtyStateChanged(); method will remove the * mark from the editor.There are more comments in-line.[1]: http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/96716/[2]: Resolving deltas: 100% (16/16)Processing changes: refs: 1, done----------Reviewing commit: a88dc2a0Authored by: Andreas Sewe <andreas.sewe@codetrails.com>The author is a committer on the project.error: You are not a project committer.error: Only project committers can push on behalf of others.Please see http://wiki.eclipse.org/CLA"
20505,1,"Patch Set 3:The only bad feeling I have about the general solution is adding a factory to the API. Isn't there a way that we don't need it?If we need it, can we make that static inner classes of the pages? The name ""pageFactory"" sounds quite unspecific to me. Should we qualify it with ""editor.PageFactory ?"
20511,0,Patch Set 6:(4 comments)I was able to push the changes I made.I had to modify the author of the commit in order to be allowed to push though.Please see the in-line comments and the comments on patch-set #5 for details.I think that the following steps are (if you agree with this method of marking the editor dirty :-) to add the snippet information in the metadata page.

20513,1,"Patch Set 8: Code-Review-1(3 comments)Hi Stefan. I had to rebase the change and resolve some conflicts. Not sure whether I broke some things, but there's at least one *bug*: If I create a new snippet (Either through the ""Create Snippet"" context menu or through ""Add"" in the Snippets view) the snippet doesn't start out as needing to be saved (the little * symbol).Aside from that, I still have the feeling that we use two framework (FormEditor and data-bindings) to do the same thing. I am afraid they may get in each other's way, so I would prefer to just use FormEditors like they are supposed to. Thoughts?"
20514,1,"Patch Set 8:(3 comments)> If I create a new snippet (Either through the ""Create Snippet"" context menu or through ""Add"" in the Snippets view) the snippet doesn't start out as needing to be saved (the little * symbol).Hi Andreas,I am not sure if this is a bug. I think this is the normal behavior of an editor. For example, if you create a new Java class in your IDE, the java editor won't pop-up and expect you to save the class before making any modifications to it.I think the snippet editor should not do this either.And you are right, the data-binding framework and the form editor framework are both tracking changes in the view/model. If we use only the form editor framework, we'll have to update the model by hand. (See the in-line comments)Also, I just realized that I might have made a mistake when using the data binding framework. This will update the model whenever changes occur in the editor, but we need to update it only when the save action takes place (i.e. in the commit method of the form parts). Although this is not visible as it only updates the in-memory model, not the actual json file, I think we still should avoid it. So this would be another +1 for not using the data binding framework."
20515,0,"Patch Set 8:Hi Stefan. I don't think the analogy with the Java editor holds up. If you create a ""New > Class"", then as soon as the dialog is closed and before the editor opens, the file already exists on disk. This is *not* the case with snippets. If I use ""Add"" or ""Create Snippet"", then the editor just opened is for a snippet that does not yet exist on disk. It *only* exists in memory. In fact, the snippet editor does not even know where on disk the snippet will be saved and in what format. This is all handled by the snippet repository (in SnippetEditor.doSave):  repo.importSnippet(snippet);What importSnippet does (e.g., creating a .json file, doing a HTTP POST to a remote server, whatever) is hidden from the editor. The editor sees only the in memory snippet. See SnippetEditorInput.oldSnippet and SnippetEditorInput.snippet. The old snippet is immutable; the new snippet may overwrite this or save it under a new UUID instead.I hope this clarifies some things."
20516,1,"Patch Set 8:As for the databinding framework: I don't think that values should be updated only upon a save. See m2e's POM Editor for example:- Open a pom.xml- On the ""Overview"" page change the ""Artifact Id"" (but do *not* save).- Switch to the ""pom.xml"" page. The XML already reflects your edit, even though the editor is marked dirty (*).I think this is *very* similar to our use case: We have two pages (Raw Source, Xtext-based Editor Source) whose contents should be kept synchronized, even if I don't do a save. Essentially, whenever a page is switched to, its contents need to be updated to what's in the in-memory model.Does this make sense?"
20517,1,"Patch Set 8:Ok, I get it now.Should we open a bug for this or make the change in this change-set?"
20518,1,"Patch Set 8:It does make sense.I have a question here. When you said we should not use data bindings, were you referring to the source page only, or to the metadata page as well?Because in the metadata page it will be hard to keep track of all the changes, especially for list viewers (I at least have no idea how to track changes to list items without creating an observable object).Also, I don't think the two frameworks get in each others way:When a change occurs, the data binding framework will update the in-memory model (the editor does not do this by itself) and the editor is marked dirty through the change listeners on the observable objects.When the editor is saved, the on-disk file is updated, and the pages are cleared of their dirty states.So the databinding framework does not really influence the way the editor is marked dirty or not (note that we'll still need listeners to mark the editor dirty without databinding), it only helps us keep the model in sync with the view.I might be thoroughly mistaken though. At the moment I'm trying to make things clear for myself as well."
20519,1,Patch Set 8:Hi Stefan. Please amend this change rather than open a new one. Having to rebase two changes rather than one is just more work.Regarding the data-binding framework: You may be right; they may not get in each others way. There's one concept in the FormEditor I'd like to understand first to see how things interact: staleness. What does it mean for a form part to be stale. Can this even happen? And what is our model w.r.t. which dirtiness/staleness are evaluated? The in-memory Snippet or the on-disk snippet (which may not exist initially)? I think it's important to answer these questions first to come up with a clean solution.
20520,0,"Patch Set 8:> Please amend this change rather than open a new one.I did not express myself properly. I did not mean to make another commit, but solve the bug during this one.As for staleness, I'll look further into it.So, for the moment we agree not to make any changes to the data bindings? (just to be sure) :-)"
20522,1,Patch Set 8: Code-Review-1I found a big problem to the current implementation: changes in one page are not propagated to other pages. This has to do with marking pages stale and the fact that data-binding listeners do not seem to react to changes in the model.I commented more about this on bugzilla < https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=436692 >.
20526,1,"Patch Set 11:>But there are still some problemsI forgot to override the commit method in the metadata page as well. My bad.If you look to the Source page, the commit method does a check that assures to commit that page only in the case of a save action.This is needed because when switching pages, the editor will commit any changes on the previous page, and that page will not be dirty anymore (unfortunately the editor stays dirty).I'll take care of it :-)"

If there are comments before the first changed line, they will be skipped the first time through.

21089,0,Patch Set 2:Thanks Dani!
21091,0,Patch Set 2: Verified+1 Code-Review+2This looks fine to me. Approving.
21113,0,Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2Packages look good to me. Tested the RCP/RAP package with positive results.
21114,0,"  Part (c) is the implementation of the delegating observables.  They ensure that the entire contract of the underlying observable is provided (including all custom interfaces such as ICommitListener) via the dynamic proxy class mechanism.  The usual contract of observables is implemented, including tracking the invocation of getter methods, all verified with a fairly comprehensive suite of JUnits tests."""
21116,1,"Patch Set 3:Patch set 3 updates the DefaultDisplayEngine to re-use SWT controls on a per-tab basis, for tabs that present the same controls for the new selection as for the previous selection.  The equivalence of the contents of a tab is determined by new equals() semantics (and accompanying hash codes, of course) for XWTSectionDescriptors and XWTTabDescriptors.  Essentially, two XWTTabDescriptors are equal (and therefore would generate the same SWT controls) if their IDs are equal and their ordered lists of section descriptors are equal.With this change, the continuity of the property sheet UI is a bit better for the user:  when changing the selection, if the new selection presents the same tab with the same widgets as the currently active tab, then that tab just shows the newly selected element.  So, for example, once the user activates the Profile tab of an element to work with applied stereotypes, that tab seamlessly updates when selecting another shape in the diagram or another element in the Model Explorer (even going back-and-forth between diagram and explorer, where selections are GEF EditParts in the one case and facet tree-elements wrapping semantic model elements in the other).  There is no flashing of the UI as controls are destroyed and re-built to look as they did before.This new patch set also fixes a problem in the delegating observables, in the case that the delegate is a delegating observable implemented as a dynamic proxy (new test cases added to cover this scenario).  This problem was uncovered in testing the customization of property-sheet models (the binding of the observable list for view constraints blew up).  The ""Customization preview"" [sic] view seems to work correctly, although I don't know what special cases there are to exercise in this view."
21117,0,"Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1I've been playing a little bit with the selection and tab changes, and at some point the Appearance tab became completely empty. (Apparently, this happens when switching from the Diagram's ""General"" tab and a graphical element's ""Appearance"" tab. And the tab remains empty until I switch e.g. from a Class to a Property, probably because they have different contents in their appearance tab)Steps:- Create a Class diagram with classes and properties- Select the diagram and go to the General tab- Select a Class and go to the Appearance tab- Switch back to the diagram: the General tab is empty- Switch back to the class: the Appearance tab is empty- Select a Property: the Appearance tab is now populated- Select the Class: the Appearance tab is now populated- Select the Diagram: the General tab is still empty- Repeat from step 3 :)Performances are otherwise really good, when switching between similar elements. Maybe this could be extended to ""Similar Sections"" (In addition to ""Similar Tabs""): for the Appearance tab, almost all sections are the same, and this is the most heavy properties tab. Currently, if we reuse the same sections between two selections, but add a new one (or remove it), everything is redrawn (Although 80% of the contents is the same)I also have quite a lot of exceptions when switching selection, especially in the dispose() methods, when using multiple selection (I'll attach the log file to the associated bugzilla)"
21118,0,"Patch Set 3:Thanks, Camille.I had a brief look at one point at reuse on a section-by-section basis, but that is complicated by the need to maintain a consistent ordering of widgets in the layout.  When a section is removed, disposing its controls is easy enough, but adding widgets is more complicated.  Perhaps I'll be inspired to take another crack at it and will find some trick that makes it work."
21119,1,"Patch Set 4:Patch Set 4 fixes the two problems observed by Camille.  Firstly, and more simply, the problem of the General tab going blank.  The problem here was that the Tabbed Property Sheet would disposed of an entire tab and its contents if the new selection didn't need that tab at all, without any interaction with the XWT-based DisplayEngine.  So, the DefaultDisplayEngine would continue to try to show disposed controls for the General tab (or any other in the same situation).  Now the DefaultDisplayEngine listens for the disposal of the controls that it creates and cleans up its understanding of which reusable controls are still available for which sections in which tabs.The exceptions in multiple-selection scenarios all boiled down to observables being prematurely disposed, either by the composite MultipleObservableValue, or by a DelegatingObservable, or by a ModelElement.  So, now all of these various components that can aggregate/share observables participate in a simple reference-counting scheme so that observables will only be disposed (and will be disposed automatically) when they are no longer in use by any component."
21134,1,"Patch Set 2: Verified+1 Code-Review-1The option works; it allows to choose the default name for sources folder.However, the following problems need to be resolved:- when a <<JavaSrcFolder>> uml::model is used with no taggedvalues, the name of the uml::model should be used as the source folder.- the name of the metamodel generatorOptionsMM is not consistent: wefound generatorOptionsMM.uml and generatoroptionsmm.ecore- a .gitignore file is commited (to exclude /bin/). Can we avoid this ?"
21135,1,"Patch Set 2:> - a .gitignore file is commited (to exclude /bin/). Can we avoid this ?The Papyrus repository already contains a global .gitignore to exclude the bin/ folder everywhere. So, additional .gitignore files should definitely not be contributed"
21148,0,"Patch Set 4: Code-Review+2Looks good! Unit tests would have been nice, but hey turns out there's no tests at all for the filter things atm..."
21162,1,Patch Set 3: Code-Review+1(4 comments)This looks very good even but it seems that there is still a race condition between checking for the lock and opening the secure store. I'm a bit worried that we would end up with false positives if we fail everything the lock was acquired. I'm not sure what the implications are of only checking for dead locks on the UI thread and what the chances are we would still run into the problem then.
21166,1,"Patch Set 4:Thanks for looking at this. We tried using a Job in the previous attempt to fix this but in order to avoid a deadlock, it's necessary to spin the event loop while the job runs, and that causes problems due to UI events being reordered. So I don't think we can take advantage of ISchedulingRule."
21174,1,"Patch Set 4:Hi Paul, Can you undo the changes to OrionConfiguration as the end result is that you did not change anything.I think you can remove the extra if block around: ServerConstants.CONFIG_SEARCH_INDEX_LOCATION + "".test"" , while testing you just set orion.search.index.location to the test location, no need for a special test property.As a rule of thumb, anytime I added a property to what could go into orion.conf, I also add an example value in web-ide.conf:#uncomment this line to specify the root location to use for Orion search indices#orion.search.index.location={location}"
21185,0,Patch Set 2:Alex: you are true. I reported a test from the diagrma dialect but it was not done on the same level (done when looking for edit parts)
21189,1,"Patch Set 2:Hi Esteban, the @author name is wrong. I think that must be corrected. Otherwise it looks good ;-)"
21195,0,Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2 Verified+1(2 comments)Nice improvements.
21197,0,"Patch Set 1:I tried things and it is a nice improvement on the previous behaviour.  I have a couple of questions/suggestions:1- the line delimiter is not very visible.  Maybe it is my own window manager, I'm not sure.2- Should the launches included in the top 3 be kept in the alphabetical order?  I personally think so.3- Should a launch triggered in the traditional ways (not using the launch bar) be included in the top 3?  It is not clear to me how much the traditional launch methods will be used when the launch bar is enabled, so I have no strong opinion about that point yet."
21199,0,"Patch Set 1:1. Separator visibility - Its Label(SWT.SEPARATOR). I think its not that visiblebecause we use custom background for this control, insteadof platform one (not sure why?). I can make 2 separators - it will make it thicker...2. Sort top in alpha order -  I don't think so. People really won't notice order when it is 3 elements. But nice thing about not keeping it in alpha order that currently selected element is always first, and previous is always second, which is nice if you switching between two. Otherwise it would be more confusing3. LC run not from toolbar - I don't think we need to keep them (and it would be hard to do also, model does have backward mapping)4. Persistence - its a good idea (maybe not in this patch though)"
21202,0,"Patch Set 1:2. Ah. I see, sure, I will keep all below the bar, thanks."
21226,1,"Patch Set 5:Patch set 5 iterates on the previous patch set, adding:  * deferral of editor re-load to when the editor is next activated.    If the dependent editor is dirty and the user elects to save it,    it is saved immediately so that the user gets immediate feed-back    that it is saved (by means of the asterisk decoration being removed).    If the user opts not to save the dependent editor, then it is not    saved but re-loading is deferred nonetheless.  The option to ignore    a dirty editor altogether works as before  * updates to the JUnit tests to account for deferral of the editor    re-load, including a new test verifying that re-load is deferred  * fixed a problem in the restoration of the palette states of    diagrams when the Palette view is active (PapyrusPaletteSynchronizer    doing stuff in the wrong sequence when at initialization and    disposal)"
21227,0,"Patch Set 5: Code-Review+1This works fineMore testing will be required to identify remaining issues, and the best way for that is probably to merge it early. The only issue I have so far is with the read-only state, which is not restored (Make a library writable from model A; modify the library from the library's own editor; save the library; the library is now read-only in model A)."
21228,0,"Patch Set 5:Thanks, Camille.  I really appreciate you wading through such a large change set, and I agree that there's plenty of soak time to shake out bugs (and a very good QA resource to find them!)Good point about writable state.  I should be able to address that easily enough."
21233,0,"Patch Set 1:Hi Eugene,You were right for  map_to_sym_table. Probably when I added the flag, I was calling it from the wrong place.I made a forward declaration now to it because my hook is using it.

21271,1,"Patch Set 1:Nice patch Dawid ! It's a pretty aggressive patch but code is much much cleaner so. @Michal : yes, comments are still ""moving"", previously ""secondReplaceBuffer"" was a clumsy attempt to ""guess"" where to put closing brackets, parenthesis, etc... between comments.Somehow, ""replaceBuffer"" caching has to be introduce again (if we don't want to do more complex changes, like splitting list of comments, memorizing the position of brackets/parenthesis between comments, etc...), but it's less important than this patch ;)I will send a little cleanup patch over this one when it's merged (to correct things i've seen meanwhile in this class)."

21386,1,"Patch Set 1: Verified-1I haven't reviewed the code, but I did try the patches. Looks ok, as far as session create, but if you try to import a trace from a live session, it's the batch import wizard that opens instead of the window to import the trace.If it's a temporary drawback, please mention it in the commit message or in a comment, so I don't consider it as a fail ;-)  I'll review the code later if you guys don't get to it first."
21387,0,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1Thanks for the comment! I'll look into the import issue. At this point, I'm not even sure what ""import"" should be for live. But at least, when the session is stopped, it should import correctly so I'll look into that.I also want to add a few test and update the documentation as part of this patch (shouldn't be big). I'm also not sure about the term ""Normal mode""..."
21392,1,"Patch Set 7:This has been approved more than one month ago now. Do we still want to delay merging this?The more we wait, the more difficult it becomes to rebase. The goal of making small patches is to make it easier to review, but also to be able to merge big parts piecewise. If we decide only merge fully-reviewed branches, we lose the second point."
21397,1,"Patch Set 3:""You may want to give a warning for now, before opening the batch import wizard, telling the user he is doing a live session and how to get to his trace (it's actually in ~/lttng-traces/<username>/ and I was looking in lttng-traces/ as usual)""It's probably ~/lttng-traces/<username> for you because hostname == username for you. for me it's emalape-laptopmodel.We don't really know where the traces will be. One can start relayd and make it output to a different folder, for example:lttng-relayd -o /home/emalape/live-outputThen when the live session is created, it will write the trace to:/home/emalape/live-output/emalape-laptopmodel/mysessionThe control view currently doesn't know about anything about the relayd process, it could be a previously spawned relayd or an automatically started relayd at session creation time. In any case, we don't know which parameters were used to spawn it so the traces could be anywhere.We could guess the path and open the non-batch import but then the user can't change directory if it's wrong. We could open the batch import and used the guessed path as the default directory when the user adds directories but it's not a very big improvement is it? About the warning, I'm not sure what to put and how. Do you mean a dialog message before opening the batch import? I'm afraid the message can't be very helpful since it has to be stay a bit vague, like ""You are importing a trace generated by a streamed session. By default the traces will be outputed to ~/lttng-traces/hostname/sessionname but the location can vary"".Let me know what you think."

21991,1,"Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1I seems that you defined the profile. Typically, I do not define a static profile, since this is somewhat redundant with the the actions done in the UML to ecore transformation.Thus, I prefer to remove the definition from the UML file and keep the original URI ending with /1 - unless that causes problems with existing model (but I don't think that the volatile stereotype has been used so far)"
21992,0,"Patch Set 2:I think we need to change the /1 because in my testing the Volatile wouldn't show up unless the profile was reapplied.

I just wasn't able to figure it out.Also, could you describe your normal workflow a bit more?  I wasn't able to get the generator to work without first defining the profile.  I assumed that was the expected sequence.  Actually -- the editor nagged be about defining the profile on every save, so I eventually gave in.I don't have a preference to any way in particular, this was just the only way I got it to work.  If you can describe your normal workflow then I can try that instead."
21993,1,"Patch Set 2:If the change in the profile is merely an addition, it is not necessary to migrate models that apply a static profile.The procedure after a profile modification is to create an ecore from the UML profile: open the profile with the UML2 editor rather than Papyrus and invoke the convert-to-ecore option. Make sure that Camel-case-names is deactivated. Then, reload the genmodel and generate code from it."

22174,0,"Patch Set 1:Your suggestion has two independent parts, correct? 1) I understand your first part as: Set the authenticator instead of a factory for the authenticator.

And thus needs to have a autentitcator factory instead of an authenticator.2) Remove the ""default"" in the set method (change setDefaultAuthenticatorFactory to setAuthenticatorFactory if done without suggestion 1) and remove the open method with the extra argument.

It can not be called from getRemoteUIServices/getUIServices/RemoteUIServicesDescriptor.loadServices because those are not guaranteed to be called before the core service is used. It it can not be called from the core loadServices without introducing a core->ui dependency. One option would be to make the user UI service (i.e. sync UI service) initialize it.

22340,0,"Patch Set 2:> The run in background button does not change the busycursor while hovering over it. The cancel button acts ok.Nice catch!  This warrants a bug for ProgressMonitorDialog to encapsulate the protected arrowCursor.  See my latest patch for the workaround. > When pressing ""Clear model cache"" i get an unrelated message in the dialog (The search was cancelled.  Not all results may have been displayed.)The filter can still search while the index job is running.  It starts a search job.  Clearing the cache cancels that job.  The search finds all items by default without typing, so it was most likely running when you cleared the cache.  See the progress view to verify there are 2 jobs running.I like having results in the table immediately, and that is why the search starts before typing anything.  Especially when the default 'Project Only' is selected. > When pressing ""run in background"", the list is not updated upon completion.The results will only update when the filter is changed due to lack of provider feedback.  See final comment on provider status callback. This is a very narrow scoped feature with much overhead.  I can't see initializing on startup, or even when the dialog first opens.  It should only happen on first use.  The provider chooses to to initialize, and the GUI has no idea this is even taking place.  The current filter/provider mechanism has no callbacks regarding initialization (only a clear cache method).   This leaves us with 2 choices:  Go back to the modal dialog with cancel option, or create a provider status callback mechanism.  I am leaning towards the thought that if you can't use the filter while the provider is initializing, there is no harm in the modal dialog.  The callback mechanism would allow the search to refresh and UI state to adjust however."

I think it would be more user-friendly to not change the view at all.  Maybe it is as simple as noticing that the context change can be ignored since the ICommandControlDMContext is the same.6- I got this NPE when switching from one launch to antoher sometimes.

However, the 'fetch' link remains usable, which will trigger a ""Fething data..."" which will only complete once the inferior is interrupted8- If there are multiple debug contexts selected,  the code choosed the first one arbitrarily.  This is not clear to the user. I suggest one of two things:  a) If all selected contexts have the same parent ICommandControlDMContext, then display resources as done now using any one context. If the parents are different, then disable and empty the view or   b) Always disable and empty the view for multi-selection9- The case where -info-os returns an error does not seem to be handled properly.  For example, if I have the OSResources view open when using a post-mortem session (core file), GDB gives:   448,664 [MI]  24-info-os   448,666 [MI]  24^error,msg=""Can not fetch data now.""   or   600,684 [MI]  25-info-os modules   600,686 [MI]  25^error,msg=""Can not fetch data now.""But the view is stuck showing ""Determining available OS resource classes..."" or ""Fetching data..."" depending on the timing.10- One time I got the following reply from GDB (maybe my gdbserver was wrong), but it caused an NPE that I think we should guard against:   915,516 [MI]  42-info-os semaphores   921,522 [MI]  ~""Ignoring packet error, continuing...\n""   921,523 [MI]  42^error,msg=""Can not fetch data now.""Exception in thread ""MI RX Thread"" java.lang.NullPointerException    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.output.MIInfoOsInfo.get(MIInfoOsInfo.java:173)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.output.MIInfoOsInfo.parseResourcesInformation(MIInfoOsInfo.java:128)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.output.MIInfoOsInfo.<init>(MIInfoOsInfo.java:75)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.commands.MIInfoOs.getResult(MIInfoOs.java:47)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.commands.MIInfoOs.getResult(MIInfoOs.java:1)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.AbstractMIControl$RxThread.processMIOutput(AbstractMIControl.java:907)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.AbstractMIControl$RxThread.run(AbstractMIControl.java:754)11- The new osresources.gif icon should go under the view16 folder and should be renamed to osresources_view.gif,    i.e., dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/icons/full/view16/osresources_view.gif    Don't forget to update the plugin.xml file to match12- In MANIFEST.MF, please export the new osview package, as the other packages are exported"

22709,1,"Patch Set 1: (16 inline comments)Thanks for the patch.  Below are general comments, and the others are in-line.  I haven't looked in detail at all the files, because there are some relatively major changes that will cause modification to those files.I think we are quite close.  The comments may seem larger than they really are, and I believe it won't take too much effort to get this ready to commit.- I found myself writing comments that I then realized where already part of the patch I had attached to the bugzilla entry.  Can you apply ""Patch to apply after this contribution gets accepted"" to your contribution?  I know that I originally said I'd handle that part, but that was because we were trying to squeeze things into Juno; since we missed Juno, we should do this right, and have the final solution ready before it is committed.- Lets add two new methods to IGDBHardwareAndOS.java (with javadoc):   void getResourceTypes(IDMContext dmc, DataRequestMonitor<String[]> rm);   void getResources(IDMContext dmc, String type, DataRequestMonitor<String[]> rm);- Implement those two methods in GDBHardwareAndOS.java to fetch the list of available resources (-info os), and to get the actual resource information for a specified type (-info-os <type>).  Then you can use that service to fetch the data, instead of sending MI commands directly from the view.- The current implementation is specific to a Linux target with a pre-defined set of resource type.  It would be better to ask GDB what the resources are and base the possible table content on that (using 'info-os' without any parameters).  This would not only allow us to handle any new resources added to GDB, but also different targets (Windows, different Linux, etc)  As the names returned by GDB are not so great ('smh' for example), I think we can keep using the name mapping you define in ResourceClassContributionItem, however, if a resource is not defined in that class we would then use whatever name GDB has sent.  I think this solution will not only be future-proof, but will simplify the implementation.- Please make sure there are no warnings in the new code - Say the view is displaying a resource type, it has the view menu showing.  If I select the 'gdb' node in the debug view (or the launch node, or unselect everything), the view menu disappers.  That is ok.  However, when I select a valid node in the debug view, the menu does not appear again, until I press refresh.- I think having a column waaaaaay on the right hand-side will cause the user to not notice that column.  This happens for Kernel modules.  Can we re-order the colums to have the big column the last one on the right?  Or can we make thatbig column less wide?- Have we already discussed that when selecting a new resource type, the view would not refresh automatically if it is empty?  I don't remember why we would have chosenthat option.  It does not seem user-friendly.- We will need to disable the view when using a session where GDB is too old. By using the IGDBHardwareAndOS service, fixing this will be easy, by simply having the service return an empty list of resources for older GDBs.  This will require a GDBHardwareAndOS_7_5 version of the service to ask GDB for -info-os, while the previous version simply returns an empty list."

22737,1,"Patch Set 1:I have pushed a Gerrit review with further changes:https://git.eclipse.org/r/26695This integrates the SysML tests into the main ""Papyrus ALL Tests"" suite in the place in the sequence where they were formerly, before they were split off into a separate execution.  A system property supports excluding these tests.A new ""Papyrus Core Tests (no SysML)"" launch configuration runs this test suite as it was before, excluding the SysML tests, using that new system property.The ""Papyrus SysML Tests"" launch configuration still launches the SysML tests only.All three of the launch configurations now configure the HotSpot JVM thus:  - max 768 MB of object heap.  This lets the tests run comfortably but    still ensures that if memory leaking regresses dramatically, we may    find out via OutOfMemoryError in test execution  - tune the garbage collector to more aggressively evict soft reference    caches than it would by default.  The Common Navigator Framework    retains everything ever shown in a tree via soft references, which    makes it difficult to see whether memory is leaking when observing    the tests under a profiler.  This also, hopefully, makes the GC    overhead a bit smoother when executing the tests with a constrained    heap limitFinally, the Ant script that runs the tests in the build is updated to remove the separate execution of the SysML tests, because these are now integrated."

22930,1,"Patch Set 6: Code-Review+1OK.  So, I determined that the problem with Patch Set #5 was interaction between UML2 and CDO.  The root cause was that computing cross-references ""intrinsically"" using eCrossReferences() triggered the CacheAdapter in a UML Property element, which uses the inverse cross-referencing capability to compute NamedElement::clientDependency (which used to be persistent in UML 2.4 but now isn't in UML 2.5).  This also triggered loading of objects from the CDO repository.The end result was that a Diagram in a *.notation resource, still only partially loaded from the repository (it didn't have its contained objects, yet) had the CacheAdapter attached and the CacheAdapter didn't find any contents or cross-references because the Diagram hadn't finished loading.  Later, when the Diagram's CDOLegacyAdapter got around to finishing loading, the CacheAdapter was unaware of new contained objects (Shapes in the persistedChildren containment reference) being added, because they are added without notifications (the assumption being that nothing needs to be notified because the object doesn't properly exist, yet; a reasonable assumption under normal circumstances).  Therefore, the CacheAdapter is never propagated to the rest of the contents of the diagram, so any code that needs to find diagram views of UML model elements doesn't find them, and Papyrus on CDO is basically broken.Patch Set #6 fixes this problem by reverting to the original design of the ECrossReferenceAdapter's getCrossReferences() method, which computes the cross-references ""extrinsically"".  To fix the memory leak (this bug) I override useIsSet() in the feature-iterator to basically re-implement the special case of eCrossReferences() from ENamedElementImpl.  It's unfortunate that this hard-codes an Ecore special case, but I don't have a better fix that doesn't break some already established clients.  Note that there isn't any feasible change that I could make in CDO to help adapters like the ECrossReferenceAdapter in the object-loading procedure, and UML isn't the only model out there that uses the CacheAdapter (UML2 SDK offers CacheAdapter as a genmodel extension for any model that it generates to use)."

22933,1,"Patch Set 7: Code-Review+1This integrates the new cross-reference iterator filtering mechanism into the ECrossReferenceAdapter.  For models that already have more highly customized cross-reference list iterators that do not extend the EContentsEList::FeatureIteratorImpl (and thus do not implement the new Filterable interface), the cross-referencer provides the same external filtering as in Patch Set 5.  This does result in derived references being computed by the underlying iterator, but it should be an exceedingly rare case.The JUnit tests are significantly overhauled, using now a generated model with some hand-written instrumentation for test assertions:  * added assertions that derived features are not computed    when the cross-referencer uses the intrinsic filtering    capability of the cross-references iterator  * added assertions that derived features *are* calculated    when the model provides a non=Filterable cross-reference    iterator  * the tests still assert proper resolving/non-resolving    behaviour of the cross-referencer, but now also for    both of the Filterable and non-Filterable iterator    casesThis new patch set does not cause any problems for Papyrus's UML modelling with CDO repositories."

For public methods in specific objects, you could have getPacketSize(), getResponseSize() etc. IFixedSize is unnecessary.- Having some private methods where size() actually means something different (only first packet) is crazy design. You know today, but 2 months from now nobody will remember, and we'll have lots of fun debugging size problems. Specific methods names, like sizeOfFirstPacket() etc. would be safer.- If there is no interface, then the methods can be static (if the size is constant, of course). If it's static, it should be a public static final int, not a method. Methods should be only where the size can vary from one object to another."

23309,1,"Patch Set 4:Thanks for giving this a look-over Daniel.  I introduced a new interface for a few reasons.First, I didn't want to filter getChildNodes() directly so as to maintain the original DOM.  The interface instead allows navigators of the DOM, such as the CSSEngine, to decide to use visibility as a shortcut.  This is useful for the CSS Spy.Second, a developer should be able to query the CSSEngine for the computed styles of an invisible widget.  I'm not sure that it's explicitly stated, but it would seem to be a reasonable expectation that if P = parent of C, then C should be a child of P.Third, I thought it might be a better pattern than cause CSSStylableElement to implement a getVisibleChildNodes(), and implement a default in ElementAdapter.  We may well have other document models that don't have a concept of visibility.I initially tried implementing this as providing an isVisible(child) method to act as a filter, but abandoned it as implementing isVisible() is particularly complicated on CTabFolder.  A CTF's children includes internal Composites and ToolBars that we can't reach programmatically, and so we can't determine their purpose.  Some of the composites exist to hold the CTabItem contents, but we can't tell which CTI.  So CTabFolderElement#getVisibleChildNodes() returns the CTabItem's control instead (perhaps it should walk and add the parents until it reaches the CTF too).  You'll also notice that getVisibleChildNodes() also returns all the CTabItem instances as they represent the tab information and they need to be exposed for tab-item properties.  Trying to shoehorn all of this into isVisible() was painful."

23466,1,"Patch Set 10:In general, the strategy we use in automated connector tests is the following:* create a new task (in this case a Gerrit review) and submit* fetch the task from the server* assert something about it's state (e.g. it is not starred)* apply the functionality to be tested to that task (e.g. set it to starred)* fetch the latest version of the task* assert that the state has changed/not changed as expected (e.g. it is starred)* delete the created task if supported by the connector (I don't think Gerrit supports this)We never do anything with existing tasks, we always create new ones. That way we aren't dependant on the test environment.If we have a test like the above for each action that the connector can take with a review (star, unstar, submit, post a comment, etc.), then we will have good test coverage and will be able to prevent regressions and be confident that each of those actions are working correctly."

23543,1,"Patch Set 2:When you are searching for an icon in a workspace with 100 plugins, but your bundle is only dependent on 10 of them, it would be nice to find those icons you are dependent on without both waiting to resolve and then sifting through all 100.I have this problem now when trying to reuse icons for my contributions to e4.tools."

23559,1,"Patch Set 1:Thanks for fixing this! I'll let Shawn comment on the code changes, but I can confirm that it fixes the issue listed in this bug:https://code.google.com/p/gitiles/issues/detail?id=5I looked at the difference between C git and JGit blame for all of ReceiveCommits.java after applying this patch. There are still a few places where they differ, but almost all of them are on trivial lines (e.g. only whitespace and a curly brace), so I'm guessing those are instances where there is not just one correct answer.You can examine the output yourself with:$ vimdiff <(git blame 61dcc102242e00d3b0061405d5c909564ebbd819 gerrit-server/src/main/java/com/google/gerrit/server/git/ReceiveCommits.java) <(~/c/jgit/org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/target/jgit blame 61dcc102242e00d3b0061405d5c909564ebbd819 gerrit-server/src/main/java/com/google/gerrit/server/git/ReceiveCommits.java)(While doing this I also noticed some more inconsistencies between C git and JGit blame that are beyond the scope of this change but I though I'd write down:-C git extends the SHA-1 abbreviations to 8 characters in the full-file case, perhaps because there was actually ambiguity among the set of SHA-1s that showed up in the range?-Ranges like -L 25,35 appear to be inclusive of the high endpoint in JGit but exclusive in C git.)"
23560,1,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1(15 comments)Its been years since I last read this code, but I agree with the basic concept of this CL. The old code was flat out wrong to skip commits already marked SEEN. They could be reached by more than one path, and in blame model that second path is carrying lines that need to be processed.The approach here is roughly correct. If the candidate is still in the queue, merge in the regions from the 2nd (or nth) path for future processing. If it was already popped, put it back in and reprocess that part of the DAG until you find an ancestor candidate that is still sitting in the queue and can have the region(s) merged into it.I mostly had style nits, and some questions about why the time equality topo sort is necessary."

23662,1,"Patch Set 4:The EMF observer situation in the 2 current tabs is a bit messy.  I was hoping to refactor all of the tabs out of the ModelEditor class and into the new tab package, using the new injection based approach instead of a gazillion factory parameters.  I suggest doing that first, and then dealing with that issue.  I am not aware of why it needed to be disabled, but I assume it was related to why I needed to create a method to 'ensure tree nodes were created'  (private Object getFirstMatchingItem(...).  Also, my other patch (already merged) on not collapsing the tree node may help to remove that requirement.  Honestly, the new method (getFirstMatchingItem) works, but I don't even know why!  I just kept poking into the Provider object until it cooperated."
23671,0,"Patch Set 6: Verified+1 Code-Review+1We can do that later. I am happy with the patch, but it does need some more work to make it a success. I am fine with letting this thing go through. Lars?Steven are you planning to stick around for a while?"

23685,0,"Patch Set 1:My experience with holding off cosmetic patches because of ""a big change coming"" is that the big change usually ends up delayed so much (which is normal, it's a big change) or canned altogether, and the small patch rots out when it could have been useful.The priority queue stuff is very promising, but it's still at the prototype level, it's realistically a couple weeks away. If you're absolutely against this change I won't merge it, but it's quite simple ([i] becomes get(i)/set(i,x)) and should be easy to rebase through."

Also, you never know whether another thread tries to open )- Synchronizes on this when modifying/checking for the open state- close() should block when the IRepository is currently in the process of being opened.Once we have this (and thereby a better understanding of the thread-safety issues) let's come up with requirements for the wrapper."

23836,1,"Patch Set 1:Oh, I didn't notice the build failure. Even though it doesn't make sense to have null values in the map, I'll change it to Collections.synchronizedMap(), because it does what we want to achieve. Thanks for pointing that out."
23837,1,"Patch Set 3:Looking closer at the differences between ConcurrentHashMap() and Collections.synchronizedMap(), I realized that the latter is not working for us because iterations over the map using iterators needs to be synchronized on the map. Otherwise we'll get ConcurrentModificationException. Since in the code we do that at several places, we would have to change these iterations to make it thread-safe. Using ConcurrentHashMap we don't have that constraint. The implementation will not cause ConcurrentModificationExceptions during an iteration. So, I changed the patch back to use ConcurrentHashMap(). I removed the failing test cases for null values since null values should not be used. The handling of null values could be improved in another patch."
23838,1,"Patch Set 3: Code-Review+2 IP-Clean+1Yeah, using synchronizedMap requires to do synchronize(map) when doing iterations. That can get complicated when the map (or Iterable view) is exposed through the API."

23917,0,"Patch Set 1:(25 comments)Looks great, just a few minor adjusted suggested."
23918,1,"Patch Set 1:David, considering the WikiText still works with Guava 12, do you really want to make 15 a pre-req? It's probably the safest thing to do but at the same time I wonder if it's worth it until we consume any of the new APIs (which of course is difficult to know since the build only runs against 15)."
23919,1,"Patch Set 1:I'd like WikiText to remain current and I'd like integrators to be able to use Guava 15 in stead of 12.  In an OSGi environment it's not critical since applications could simply have both dependencies, but for simple non-OSGi Java applications with a single classpath that would be impossible.  See  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=430477 for an example of the kind of problems that can come up.I don't think that we have an easy way to support both 15 and 12, so updating this dependency makes sense to me.  What do you think?"
23920,1,"Patch Set 1:I'm not sure I understand. This change forces Guava 15 on integrators rather than giving them more choice. My understanding is that it can be problematic to combine multiple versions of Guava in a product: bug 427862. Generally speaking, version constraints should specify the actual requirements of a bundle and not reflect product packaging concerns so I'd postpone this change until Guava 15 specific APIs are actually used."
23922,1,Patch Set 1:The Guava versioning doesn't follow OSGi semantics AFAIK. While not all APIs are backwards compatible in the latest Guava I thought the ones used by Mylyn were so my assumption is that for now Mylyn is compatible with Guava 12-15. If that's not the case we should certainly up the version constraints to require Guava 15. It's the safest thing for sure since that's what we are testing against now.
23923,1,Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2 IP-Clean+1I don't see any way that we can reliably ensure compatibility with both 12.0 and 15.0 without actually building/testing with both versions.  The effort required to do that is high enough that I think we should up the version constraint to 15.0.
23924,1,Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1It makes sense to me that we keep it simple. Let's require Guava 15 across the board for Mylyn 3.12. We can always go back and consider testing against different versions if needed.
23926,1,Patch Set 1:I'm not sure what this change does? That repository is the default anyways and the build worked for me from master: https://hudson.eclipse.org/mylyn/job/gerrit-mylyn-incubator/38/ .

24150,0,"Patch Set 2:(16 comments)Thanks for the valuable feedback!Regarding the distinction of C++11 attributes and GCC attributes: I left the GCC attributes as is and added the attribute specifiers for representing C++11 attributes. The distinction can be seen for example in the NodeWriter. If an I(CPP)ASTAttribute is encountered in a IASTAttributeOwner it is expected to be a GCC attribute. If an ICPPASTAttributeSpecifier is encountered there, it is expected to be a C++11 attribute. The previous implementation of attributes is a bit limiting regarding the capabilities required by C++11 attributes (scope and multiple attributes in one specifier).I also thought about a solution which introduces an attribute specifier for GCC attributes, but that would break the current API. It's related to the problem mentioned in my comment (Line 23) in ICPPASTAttributeSpecifier."
24157,0,Patch Set 5:- I've added separate getter methods for accessing C++ and GNU attributes.- I've improved cases in which the GNU attributes had not been added to the AST.
24159,0,Patch Set 5:(22 comments)Thanks for the input. Changed most points accordingly. I had to change the InstanceOfPredicate slightly - see Patch Set 6
24163,1,"Patch Set 4:It's ineviatble that the different attributes don't reside at the same location. E.g. attributed using directives:* GNU: using namespace inner __attribute__((__strong__));* C++11: [[attr]] using namespace NS;Either we could separate the C++ and GNU attributes on the node (ASTAttributeOwner), or we introduce a filter to allow only certain attribute specifier types to be visited at the corresponding location.The first option seems not that neat to me, as we would have a dependency on IASTAttributeOwner level to the more concrete concepts of GNU and C++ attributes.I dont' expect there to be a similar problem with other nodes where we already solved this problem, right?"

Why did you only call it getActiveEditor() and not getActiveCellEditor()?

24352,1,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1Hi,thanks for contributing via Gerrit. I know about the contribution in the ticket itself, but I didn't had time to dig into this in more detail.Some things about your contribution:1. It seems you have the trailing whitespace issue. Looking at the ScrollBarHandlerTemplate there seem to be more changes marked as there are really. Could you please try to solve that so checking the changes is easier?2. This change may break backwards compatibility in case the ActiveCellEditorRegistry was used outside NatTable to perform modifications inside. Like exchanging the data or deleting a current selected value (e.g. https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=425176)Although the intention about the change is correct, I would like to keep the AbstractCellEditorRegistry for backwards compatibility. But it should be marked as deprecated, pointing to the new instance and telling about the issue when using it further. So users who will update won't get compile errors immediatelly.3. ScrollBarHandlerTemplateAlthough I'm not quite sure how to solve it better, I don't like the solution so far. The first thing is the instanceof check that seems to be not necessary. I thought you wanted to get rid of it?The second thing is that this change might not be compatible with the split viewport feature that was added lately. If you check the _703_HorizontalSplitViewportExample you will see that the sliders will be created by using the parent composite of the NatTable instance and are then added later on. So in case of split viewports, your change will break functionality."
24353,1,Patch Set 1:I pushed it to gerrit for easier communication. Doing stuff through Bugzilla is just too complicated.@1: There went something wrong when merging. I will correct that.@2: AbstractCellEditorRegistry: Will try to keep the instance and update it whenever the editor gets created/disposed.@3: I would need to do an API change in order to pass in the table to the handler. If this is OK i can do it. Otherwise i do not see how this can be solved. Thanks for the review :)

24356,0,"Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1(1 comment)Hi,thanks for the contribution. But it has some things you need to fix/add.1. Trailing white spaces. You need to ensure that there are no trailing whitespaces. You can configure that in git config, so that is handled automatically.2. I think there are some issues in SizeConfig. On getSize() you always calculate percentage sizes. But that call should only be performed if percentage sizing is enabled. Why did you remove that check?Also you forgot to invalidate your aggregate cache when calling setSize(). Currently you are only doing this on setDefaultSize() and setPercentageSize().3. I would also like to see test cases for your changes. With changing the aggregate calculation for caching you are changing quite a basic logic. This needs to be tested well. So there should be test cases for all cases.Greez,Dirk"
24357,0,"Patch Set 2:1. Thanks, I did not know this.2. I removed the check because it was done twice (once outside the method and once inside the method. Also the cache is invalidated on setSize() however the code comparison only shows this below your comment.3. Indeed, I shall try adding some."

What do you think?The JavaDoc of doReturn() advises to use this method ""in those rare occasions when you cannot use Mockito.when(Object)"" and recommends to always use Mockito.when(Object) for stubbing ""because it is argument type-safe and more readable (especially when stubbing consecutive calls).""In this case, it's indeed much shorter and actually to read.

24468,0,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1(11 comments)Hi GenevieveI like your effort to simplify the creation of tree viewers for displaying trace data that supports the TMF time range and selection synchronization. I created one simple viewer with hardcoded data and it was straight forward.However, I see a lot of overlap of this with the packages  org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.viewers.statistics.model, org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.viewers.statistics. The classes TmfBaseColumnData, TmfBaseColumnDataProvider and ITmfColumnDataProvider could be re-used here. Would it be possible to extract the common parts from the statistics packages and use it with the abstract tree viewer?"
24469,1,"Patch Set 1:(1 comment)Hi Bernd,Indeed, I took some inspiration from the statistics. And as I was talking with Alex, the statistics is unncessarily complicated, and with the analysis framework, the statistics framework is not as useful as it used to be.So once this is accepted, the statistics will be rewritten to make use of this simpler version and a lot of code will go! So I preferred to start from the minimal requirements, if it means adding new methods eventually, than try to remove from the existing code."
24470,1,"Patch Set 1:Well the statistic framework has some features which are currently not used and that's why it seems complicated for what it is used for. Unfortunately, it's only be used for event counts and it's not possible to see the potential of it. It could have been used for many other statistics. BTW, I didn't write the code but the design was based on my proposal to the student who did it during his internship. Please update the code according to the comments. Also, give credit to the original author of code that was migrated."
24471,0,"Patch Set 2:Hi Bernd, I added the column provider, as it may be useful for some cases and it doesn't add any overhead. But except for the interfaces, the classes themselves are too statistics centric to be re-used here. The statistics is a special use case of the tree viewer and it can be made to use these new classes. I'll leave that to someone else though, maybe as an exercice for the new students to start with TMF views?I took the column data and provider from the statistics framework. But for the abstract tree viewer and entries themselves, it is inspired from pretty much all other TMF views (time graph, xy charts, statistics)"

24650,1,Patch Set 15: Code-Review+1A good starting point for symlink tests regarding checkout. +1 from me.An idea for more tests: All the tests here work mainly with two different states. What's in the current commit and what's in the commit I want to checkout. During checkout there are two more states which could differ from these two states. The index and the working tree. So we need (maybe in subsequent changes) tests where the working tree is dirty (differs from index) and where we have staged but uncommitted changes.

By merging keybindings from current states of BindingManager and model we get complete set of key bindings.I attach an alternative change (result is the same as previously).

24815,1,Patch Set 2:There is a bug about that https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=415230 . Using the native GTK API should be bette as it would delegate managing all these.
24816,0,"Patch Set 2:Alexander, I'm not that familiar with GTK to answer if it's possible to create a button without having to create compound container (as it's asked in #415230). But if that issue will be solved, probably bug #314815 will be solved too. My solution is a way simpler that what is proposed in #415230. To fix this buggy effect: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=187549 it's enough to hide a label if it's empty. That's it.My solution is just hides the label if it's text is not specified, pretty the same way as it's already done with images."

25328,0,"Patch Set 1:If that is the common concept in e4, than of course I agree.Just one thing to consider: Looking into the implementation, there are three steps that need to be performed for a locale change:1. setting the context value for TranslationService.LOCALE2. notify the application model3. sending the event1. and 3. are easy to achieve as it is one line of code anywhere. 2. is a bit more complicated. But as LocaleChangeServiceImpl.updateLocalization() is protected, people could extend it for their own implementation. We could also think of making this method a static helper method, so people are able to simply use it for their use cases.If people are forced to implement their own stuff in such special cases (which is really fine for me), than we should at least provide as much help as possible and not leave them in copying framework code."

25594,1,"Patch Set 6:PTAL.And I'm open to a discussion on why this should be remove.In fact, I believe HistoryTree should _not_ exposed the notion of ""lastBranch"". This is a violation of an abstract data-structure API and complexify the evolution on the HistoryTree.These kind of methods should be exposed only when ""really, but really"" expensive otherwise. It's better to find a solution under the hood than postponed to the data-structure user the tree walking management."
25596,1,"Patch Set 6:> HistoryTree should _not_ exposed the notion of ""lastBranch""I agree it should not be exposed ""upwards"", because that is implementation-specific. However, the HT_IO is also something specific to the HistoryTree. At first this class was introduced solely to reduce the amount of LOCs in HistoryTree. So I don't think it's *that* bad if HT_IO knows how the HistoryTree works a bit.Or we could also scrap it and put all the functionality in HistoryTree, if that makes it cleaner.About the readNodeFromMemory/readNodeFromDisk, the issue is not just the overhead, it's actual functionality that might break if we don't have a ""readNodeFromMemory"": if a history tree is queries while it's being built, the nodes in the latest branch are not written to disk yet. But in the tree they technically exist. So if HT_IO tries to read them like a ""normal"" node, funny things will happen."
25597,1,Patch Set 6:I prefer keeping it isolated.Some idea for node compression etc... could be put in this layer (read/write to disk layer).I need to understand your arguments on the HistoryTree.We should meet in face of a white board.
25599,0,"Patch Set 6: Verified+1 Code-Review+1 IP-Clean+1Ok, indeed after clarification, this should not change the behavior, this is just a refactor, making the HT_IO ""API"" a bit cleaner and better separated.I'd be fine with merging this as-is. If we ever find the ""skip looking in memory"" optimization was really useful, we could always add it back, at the HistoryTree level."

25772,0,"Patch Set 2:> This is by design. Merely changing null.unboxInt() to return 0 instead of -1 will break MANY things only in the state system (like stack attributes, off the top of my head). And that's without talking about views.There's a few things broken as it is now:- You can't get a -1 Int value from the factory method but you can get one using incrementAttribute() on a -2 Int value- Calling incrementAttribute() on this -1 Int value skips 0 and goes to 1.- The State System Explorer view cannot display a factory-made -1 Int value (as it is nullValue), it shows a blank value.If there is any code that is using the unboxed value of nullValue to check for null, that is badly designed code because it cannot differentiate with a real Int of that same value, it should use isNull(). I believe it's better to bite the bullet and correct that code now. Hopefully all of it is fixed by the patch now.Mathematically, I think it makes more sense to use zero as the null value's numerical value.> This is also by design. If we start to allow unboxing from one type to another, people might stop caring about what the actual type is, and always unbox their things into longs for example, doing costly casts over and over.It's a point to consider, but I prefer to give the benefit of the doubt and the flexibility to the designers. In the code I'm doing now, I have to do floating point mathematical operations on a list of state values that can be a mix of Int, Long, Double or nullValue. Using unboxDouble() gives much cleaner code than having a if-else or switch statement on the value Type to figure out the correct unboxing method.The unit tests should be correct now. The LTTng kernel state system creates a Threads/-1 attribute because the first events arrive before the Current_thread attribute has any value set. I considered updating the expected test state system with these events using the Threads/0 attribute (due to the current thread nullValue's int value), but decided against it because it would still be incorrect to consider that these events occurred in the swapper (0) thread. So the nullValue current thread continues uses the -1 attribute for the 'unknown' thread."
25774,0,"Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1We had another quick discussion on this ;)What seems like the less intrusive solution that would bring an improvement would be to keep an int value corresponding to Type.NULL, but instead of -1 we could use Integer.MIN_VALUE, which is used less often in normal use cases."

25829,1,Patch Set 1:@Andreas: I thought about and would say: yes and no ;-)The ProjectCoordinateProvider uses the ProjectCordinateAdvisorService and add the cache (DependencyInfo --> Pc) functionality. Until here it sounds like a wrapper. But it also provide the mapping between workspace artifacts and DependencyInfos. The class has two responsibilities of that class and I would say that adding the configuration logic of the ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService would make it worse.Also I would like to mention an other point: At the moment as user of the API you can get injected a ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService or/and a ProjectCoordinateProvider as well. The ProjectCoordinateProvider access the ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService inclusive the cache logic. The ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService access the advisors directly. I think this looks a little bit confusing and inconsistent.I mentioned that because I thought about a solution to fix both:What do you think about create a wrapper for ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService which take care of the configuration AND the cache (DependencyInfo --> Pc) logic?The ProjectCoordinateProvider will still have the other cache and would use the wrapped ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService.I think we would get a better separation and could get rid of the inconsistens by using ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService without cache and ProjectCoordinateProvider with cache both.

26136,0,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1(15 comments)Hi XavierVery nice addition! Our user will want that.Beside the inline commends I have two requests below. Please let me know what you think about it.Currently, there is no means to trigger the export command handler. I would suggest to add this to the TmfEventsTable Pop-up menu.Here how you could call the command handler in the method createPopupMenu() of the TmfEventsTable programmatically:final IAction exportToTextAction = new Action(""ExportToText"") {            @Override            public void run() {                IWorkbenchPage activePage = PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getActiveWorkbenchWindow().getActivePage();                IHandlerService handlerService = (IHandlerService) activePage.getActiveEditor().getSite().getService(IHandlerService.class);handlerService.executeCommand(""org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.exportToText"", null);            }        };tablePopupMenu.add(exportToTextAction);-------I also would like to ask you to change the format of the text file to match the columns in the table and instead of a hard-coded order of columns (which are actually the default TMF table columns). This you can achieve using methods extractFieldItems() of TmfEventsTable and getColumns() of the TmfVirtualTable instance which is a member of TmfEventsTable. You will need some public methods to access these information and pass a reference to the TmfEventsTable instance as command parameter."

26432,1,Patch Set 3: Code-Review-2while I agree with removing of the wizard I don't agree with the removing of RPMExportOperation. It should be used as a base (or some other class extending Job) and provide a standalone export operation that would even be exposed as API for possible usage in other tools like fedorapackager. This patch would be changed a lot together with the it's parent.
26437,1,Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1(6 comments)The code does not belong to rpm.ui.editor but to rpm.ui or even rpm.core if it doesn't have UI dependency. I understand that you tried to follow the way things were done but these are legacy errors because in the past everything was in rpm.ui.editor and code is still not refactored to have proper logical structure. We should not make it harder to fix in the future.

26657,1,Patch Set 2:(2 comments)Patch Set 1 shows the simple apprach which tries to minimize the number of cache entries which has to be invalidate after manual mappings changes. Bases on the old value of the ProjectCoordinate a lookup in the cache is made. All entries which are equal to the old value are refreshed. If the old value is absent() (worst case) this means that all absent() entries will be refreshed.Patch Set 2 (As discussed with Andreas) shows the approach using two caches (IPackageFragementRoot --> DependencyInfo and DependencyInfo --> ProjectCoordinate). With this approach we can directly invalidate the affected mapping.What do you think?
26658,0,"Patch Set 2:(6 comments)I like patch 2 better. Assuming the persistence logic is not really longer than in patch 1, the change is even slightly shorter.Speaking of persistence: I think only the mapping DependencyInfo -> ProjectCoordinate should be persisted.

I can't rememeber the exact issue, but because of simplifications in the API, we can no longer infer the generics in the same way we used to. So rather than reengineer that for no gain, the simplest thing to do is just do waay with the generics since they aren't used anywhere. > Also, some changes in RemoteEmfConsumer, like the new notifyObservers method,> look like refactoring to me.

Pain and tears ensue. Moving to the in-band approach would undoubtedly be the correct way to fix this.(those is-the-statesystem-started-yet? latches make me cringe ;) )However, this is a very big undertaking. It might be worth focusing on the future instead, where the ""analysis"" is the owner of the state system. Where it would control and know when construction is started and when it's done. We could learn from history, and do it right this time."

When a part is activated that is not a trace editor (for example a Java editor), it did not previously mark the trace as unselected. With this path it does, so an unnecessary TmfTraceSelected signal could be broadcast. Receivers can however ignore it if the signal's trace is the same that they are currently handling."

Nothing wrong with that, but we will have to update them when we do the EMF edit part.  Finally I'm having a few observations/questions on the model:    For the Approval and Requirements, I think the model is generic enough, although I never worked with requirements in Gerrit and I'm not sure how they work really.    I think the model is overly complex now with ReviewItemSets, ReviewItems and File items.  Do we really need the ReviewItem element anymore?  To me the information it holds pretty much relates to the ReviewItemSet (i.e. Gerrit PatchSet) anyways, so why keep it?    I saw that you introduced a Change element as a Review superclass.  What is the rationale behind this?  Can't all the info be in a single Review EClass?  Insn't Change a little bit too Gerrit-specific?  Also, I noticed that review now has Change parents and childrens elements.  I suppose this is to take care of the Depends and Needs Changes in Gerrit to see dependencies accross reviews.  Am I right in this?    The TaskReference is gone from the Review, but is still in the ReviewGroup.  I am a little confused by this.  I thought that the REview itself was a Mylyn task, so now where is the link?  Also, why do we still have a taskReference at the Review Group level?  I don't think we need it.    The location right now is restricted to line ranges i.e. textual input.  This will eventually have to change if we want to support Model Reviews, where the ""location"" is not a line range.

And it's also a practical thing because we want to be able to create one-off parent and children changes attached to reviews. These aren't actually changes per se, they're (in Gerrit) simply git references.

Did you consider using a GradientToolTip instead of the listener in PatchSetSection? I would prefer to reuse the logic that's already in the tooltip class and potentially provide a hover with additional information. For the decorations it could be better to use a decorator similar to how R4E implements these: http://git.eclipse.org/c/r4e/org.eclipse.mylyn.reviews.r4e.git/tree/org.eclipse.mylyn.reviews.r4e.ui/src/org/eclipse/mylyn/reviews/r4e/ui/internal/navigator/ReviewNavigatorDecorator.java?id=90a91c4524a85a9ee8dbbf965b1e8f667b9ebbf2In terms of the icons, it would be nice to use the same icons that EGit or R4E uses for consistency. They also have more contrast to make them more visible. You can see them in the EGit commit viewer.Please note that Miles is currently working on a larger refactoring which will affects the same area of code and moves the label provider into the framework: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/8732/.

28903,0,"Patch Set 2:This seems like a good approach. My only concerns at this point:* Why does ITmfSourceLookup have both the notions of callsite and model URI? An event cannot supply one without supplying the other? Would it be better to have those in two separate interfaces?Next you're gonna say: ""That event can just return null then."" To which I'd ask, why don't we just cram those methods in ITmfEvent then?* Related to the previous point, the tmf.core.event package is starting to bloat again... Maybe it'd be worth moving all lookup-related interfaces and methods to a core.event.lookup package or similar?"
28904,0,"Patch Set 2:Hi Alex, it's funny initially I had 2 interfaces. But I didn't want that we have Interfaces for each special attributes. Technically, both are a similar concepts. Based on your comment in the meeting to avoid too many interfaces for special attributes I went with the one interface approach. So, I should have went with my initial thought. Anyways, I'm going to change it to 2 interfaces because events will only implement what they need. I hope this is ok.Having a own package makes sense."
28905,0,"Patch Set 5: Verified; Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completedQuick suggestion, I just moved the call to tmf.core.tests.event.lookup.AllTests to the top-level AllTmfCoreTests (which calls every package). This mimics how it's done in tmf.ui.tests."

29072,1,Patch Set 5: (8 inline comments)On a high level this looks like a good change. I have voted -2 though since we must not add a dependency on a specific team provider (jgit in this case) to the review framework. I also agree with Miles that passing the repository along through the call chain isn't optimal. I would suggest that we discuss on the bug how to resolve the design issues.A few other things:* @version should be removed. We don't use them in Mylyn since it's easy enough to obtain that from the SCM and they tend to cause weird merge conflicts.* All changed files should have a corresponding copyright note under Contributors in the copyright header section. Files with substantial changes should also have an @author tags.

29082,1,"Patch Set 8:The code was adapted to work with the new Remotes API that was just merged in.  Basically the functionality is as before and is tested (except for comparing review items which I could not test due to new bug 403389).There is one part missing to resolve the File Revisions when opening a file from the Review Navigator.  Miles I will need your help for this one, see the TODO comments in OpenCompareEditorProvider#init.Right now I use the ReviewBehavior object to pass in the parent repository needed to resolve the file revision from the team repository and the resolution is done when the file is opened in the compare editor.  Ideally, we should add a reference to the repository in the ReviewItemSet model element and a team IFileRevision reference in the Mylyn Review IFileRevision.  This would enable use to decorate the IFileItem icon in the GErrit Task editor and Review Navigator at all times.  However, to make that work, we need a way to detect that the workspace file has changed to redo the resolution when the user changes his workspace (e.g. when checking out another git branch).  This should be investigated and done as part of the effort for bug 371428, which is the evolution of the solution provided here).We should also change the Mylyn Review IFileRevision element name to IFileVersion to avoid confusion with the team API element (see bug 403393)In any case, except for the OpenCompareEditorProvider problem, this is ready for the final review"

29162,1,"Patch Set 1:The infinite recursion in both IndexCPPTemplateResolutionTest.testConstantPropagationFromHeader and my test project can be avoided by not marshalling the template definition when serializing EvalFixed. In fact EvalFixed doesn't need to know the template definition since it doesn't do any lookups dependent on it. It probably makes sense to split CPPEvaluation into two classes, one derived from another, with fTemplateDefinition in the derived class. EvalFixed would then be able to derive from a more light-weight superclass.Another change I would suggest is adding a constructor to all evaluations except EvalFixed that takes IASTNode pointOfDefinition parameter. This would allow for making DeferredResolutionBinding a nested class of CPPEvaluation and replacing SemanticUtil.findEnclosingTemplate(IASTNode) by a private method in CPPEvaluation."
29164,1,"Patch Set 2:Here is an updated patch that fixes the infinite recursion in the way you suggested, and also fixes a regression I saw in my codebase (I added a new test for it). Please let me know if you see any other regressions in yours.Regarding the addition of constructors taking an ""IASTNode pointOfDefinition"" parameter to evaluations other than EvalFixed: is there a way to do this without duplicating the constructor body of every evaluation?Also, how did you tell that the infinite recursion happened in IndexCPPTemplateResolutionTest.testConstantPropagationFromHeader?

29241,1,"Patch Set 1:It's an empty method in abstract class which looks really weird. From an API POV it should be marked as abstract so implementers be aware that they really need to implement it in order to get full functionality, if they don't care they can put empty implementation themselves. I for one would easily miss it the way and wonder why the hyperlinks are not working."

29441,1,Patch Set 2:New version:* Use the same numeral for WAIT_BLOCKED and the old WAIT state. That means anybody not rebuilding an existing state system will at least get the same colors most of the time.* Use a paler orange-ish color for the WAIT_FOR_CPU state. Suggestions still welcome.* Tweak the color of the INTERRUPTED state a bit to differentiate it better.Also reworked ControlFlowPresentationProvider so that we only need to define new states in one place.

29581,1,"Patch Set 2: Do not submitThe correct approach is to get rid of the custom 'Show In' menu at all and use the built-in support, so that we do not get different menus when using the context menu and Navigate > Show In (Alt+Shift+W).If this can't be fixed via 'plugin.xml' contribution, then we should simply contribute the menu like we do it for all the other views, i.e. in the code."
29585,1,Patch Set 4:Properties [Alt+Enter] must not be removed. This should be in all context menus as last item (currently not the case in the Repo view ==> a bug).The next patch set should also use the new helper that creates the 'Show In' menu with the key binding in the label.

In RepositoriesViewActionProvider.fillContextMenu(IMenuManager) you would then add the 'Show In' menu as done in the other views (using your helper) and make sure it appears at the right location. One would normally use ""group.show"" (ICommonMenuConstants.GROUP_SHOW), but the Repo view context menu is pretty messed up, so I guess this would place it somewhere at the top."

30030,1,"Patch Set 3:I find the framing of the tool descriptions very distracting and it isn't done elsewhere in other UI pages.  I suggest just using [] around them as you did before.The tool-tips are now actually special notes to the user and IMO should start with ""Note:"". The perf tool tip doesn't provide anything meaningful since all tools require installation.  I would prefer you say: ""Note: does not require set-up or special compilation"" which explains why we chose it as the default.Instead of ""Cache Using"" for cachegrind which is very awkward I would suggest: ""Cache Usage"" or ""Cache Reporting"".For Callgraph, say: ""Note: requires SystemTap to obtain data"" or something to that effect rather than talking about the SystemTap language.For the ones requiring compilation, I'm not sure whether to include the C/C++ qualifier or not.  They will require rewording if specifying a note: for example, gprof could be worded as:  ""Note: requires compilation of at least one C/C++ source file using ""-pg"" option."" possibly leaving out the C/C++ part which is implied by our tools (see next paragraph).This brings up an interesting issue.  Since our tools only support C/C++, should the Profiling preferences and Properties be under the C/C++ Preferences and Properties.  This should not be solved in this patch and would require a separate RFE or bug.For now, I would suggest adding something to the top Profiling page, which currently doesn't have anything on it, to indicate that the preferences are for tools using the Linux Tools profiling framework for C/C++ projects.  This will at least prevent any confusion.The Restore Defaults buttons on all the pages do not operate properly as they set the default to be the first item in any radio group.  It should restore the preferred provider.  If this is due to this change, fix it, otherwise, open a separate bug and fix this in a separate patch."

If the unit size is greater than 1 and only one byte in the unit has changed the remaining bytes in the unit don't have the 'HISTORY_KNOWN' flag set. As a result the entire unit is not regarded as being tracked."

It tried both. Your observation might be true for distribution-installed plug-ins. Nevertheless, I'm OK with the change. The move to Import-Package will allow for looser coupling between plug-ins.Here is an interesting blog about this topic:http://www.vogella.com/blog/2009/03/27/required-bundle-import-package/"

30531,1,"Patch Set 3:The new behaviour only applies to dev mode, i.e. when running Tycho ITs from within m2e workspace using special ""Tycho IT"" launch configuration. Verifier will fork maven in separate JVM when running ITs from command line.In dev mode, Verifier is supposed to create new classloader(s) for each invocation, so each test should get fresh set of all static variables and singletons. Unfortunately, there is several thread leaks in Maven and P2 that result in OOME permgen due to classloader leak if you attempt to run all Tycho ITs in dev mode. I know how to fix these leaks, but did not have time/motivation to push these yet.Still, even ability to run/debug individual Tycho ITs without having to do ""mvn install"" first is a huge step forward in my opinion."

30672,1,Patch Set 7:Do we really need that? I wrote a big parts of this and only my last addition of test cases brought it over >250 lines. Markus asked in on a comment on patchset 2 from Jul 9 whether somebody wants to take over this change. Since he was the one who found the initial problem I didn't wanted to take over. But if this leads now to a CQ I ask myself:- would it help if I takeover authorship. Markus is ok with that.- would it help if I remove my last testcase additions and add them in a different change.
30673,1,"Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisI found a bug and fixed it, but I have to do some double-checks with native git before we can accept this bug.That's the problem: During merge we update the index and populate the worktree for some paths. Problem is: it's a long running operation and we want to be able to recover from a failed operation without leaving a corrupted repo/work-tree. E.g. what happens if we have succesfully updated (overwritten) 10000 files but when writing file 10001 this fails and we want to rollback. Therefore we prepare the new index first and if the index was succesfully persisted then we start modifying the work-tree (what we should write in the work-tree can be seen from the new index). Means: we first call indexBuilder.commit() and then we call checkout(). That's wrong because the checkout() provides us with information which have to go into the index. Especially we don't know lastModified and length of a file until we have written it to disk. For lastmodified that's clear. But think about how autocrlf influences length. I changed it now that we first checkout all files (which updates lastModified and length of DirCacheEntries) and then we persist the index. As I said: no sure about whether this is correct and I'll investigate further."
30676,0,Patch Set 5:Mainly cleaned up the test case and increased the performance of this test. The test contained a lot of sleeps to avoid racily clean index entries. The number of sleeps have been reduced and the test runs faster.I am more confident about this fix because I see that native git also goes the same direction to update the working tree first and the update the index (see http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/jgit-dev/msg01730.html).One leftover is still not completely clear. Are there situations where we have to rollback modified working tree files in case while updating the working tree or the index we run into exceptions (e.g. can't update a locked working tree file)
30677,0,"Patch Set 8: Looks good to me, but someone else must approveI removed a tests which I authored and which was not important for this specific issue. Now this change has according to lcp 243 lines. Markus gave his legal statement ... so in my eyes this is ready to be submitted."

30685,0,"Patch Set 2:thanks robin; actually, i would have liked it very much to be able to re-use old index entries with stored values instead of asking the working tree iterator for them; is there a way to do this (a performant way of course ;))?"
30686,1,Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisas already discussed: we definitely have a bug in how ResolveMerger creates DirCacheEntries. But blindly copying a for every entry metadata from the file to the dircache is wrong and not performant. I will contribue in a few hours one testcase which I am currently developing which already now shows the bug (unnecessary smugded entries after a merge). Also because of another problem discussed in http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/jgit-dev/msg01726.html I am developing more tests here.But in general I think we found a more severe bug and I am happy to see the root cause of smudged entries.

30761,0,"Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisI like the idea to cleanup certain timestamps during checkout, but we can't do this so blindly. It's wrong to always update the index entry with the timestamp of the associated work-tree file. Sometimes we keep index entries although we know that the filesystem has already been modified. Simply copying the filesystem timestamp would be wrong. Think about this: git init touch f.txt        // lastmodified(f.txt) = m git add f.txt      // timestamp(indexEntry(f.txt)) = m git commit -m initial git checkout -b side touch g.txt git add g.txt git commit -m modified1 sleep 2            // to avoid smudged entries echo x > f.txt     // lastmodified(f.txt) = m + 1 git checkout masterIn the last checkout we want to keep the index entry for f.txt with the timestamp of 'm' although we know that thefilesystem has already 'm + 1'Another issue is that this may be quite expensive (not sure about it). Imagine you have the linux kernel repo with 38000 files. You switch from branch master to develop. Since you have not touched the files we want to keep all 38000 files. And youre change forces us to ask the filesystem 38000 times for a timestamp. Without your change we can completely ignore the filesystem and the index for all those files where the HEAD version and the BRANCH version are equal (BRANCH version is the active version on the branch you want to checkout). I love this feature of git to be able to switch branches without having to check the dirtyness of the index and the working tree for 99% of the files.But: maybe you could check for smudged entries and update only them. If for smudged entries (timestamp=0) the filesystem content is the same as the index content then we could use copy over the filesystem lastmodified date and unsmudge the entry."
30762,0,"Patch Set 3:thanks for the review. i'm clearly no expert in this area (not yet ;)), and i knew this approach is (probably) not perfect. if you have ideas on how to do better, please feel free to instruct me (instruct me like a 4 year old, pls ;)) or even take over the change.i can only say about the performance: we have a repo with ~33000 files, and this was the reason i tried to improve the situation: re-indexing took ~5-10 minutes (!), and with this change is down to a few seconds, which is way better. AFAICT, the reading of the filestamp is rather unexpensive (at least compared to not reading it, and re-hashing file contents all the time ;)).if the keep() method is the wrong place, or if more care needs to be taken when to call it with zero (old behaviour) or the current file's timestamp (new behaviour) - i can't tell, but you may tell me, and i'll do my best :)currently i just can say that all unit tests go ok, and that i'm quite satisfied with how /fast/ this makes working with JGit/EGit; it really is approximately 50 times faster in most situations, and i had to wait _a lot_ before."
30763,1,"Patch Set 3:ah, i missed your last sentence: update updating only when timestamp = 0. the initial problem was that _all_ timestamps, except for file that where staged or modified in the last commit on the tip of the current branch (cool, eh?) where zero. thats why i was re-setting them. but after actually running this code once, timestamps where kept correct i think. maybe it would be better to check and only do when it is zero."
30764,0,"Patch Set 3:long story short - i think a unit test to check the modification times in the index would be a good idea, to proof the different states.could you help me figure out the different things that should work? your first example is a good one for the first test case :)"
30765,1,"Patch Set 3:i now did a little testing (i will add the test to this change later). for me it seems that my change does not change the behavior in any case. even the case you mentioned in your comment behaves the same (it's broken ;)), regardless of whether i have my code in or not. i will look into fixing it to behave correctly - we'll see"

30796,0,"Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisHow does this relate to core.filemode?I was wondering why we don't need this kind of check in other places (e.g. status (decoration), checkout, reset). Why does the decorator in EGit shows the file as non-dirty although the jgit Merger thinks they are dirty?I think that most jgit code respects core.filemode configuration parameter. If set to false jgit will think that differences in executable bits are irrelevant. See WorkingTreeIterator.compareMetadata() to see how executable bits are handled there. Can't we make use of this method also here instead of reinventing the check?Native git on windows has the same problem. Clone jgit on windows with msysgit and afterwards set the configuration parameter core.filemode to true. A git status will tell that the worktree is dirty e.g. because of the filemode of org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst-rsrc/org/eclipse/jgit/test/resources/create-second-pack.If you now try to rebase master on top of another branch msysgit will not start doing this because he thinks the worktree is dirty.

30976,1,"Patch Set 10:Content can't change during reading. Or at least it shouldn't. The correct way to modify the config file is to write a new copy of it to config.lock, then atomically rename config.lock to config. Anyone who edits the file in place is just asking to corrupt the file, and/or confuse a concurrent reader.But since this code is opening the file and then later stats it to find the length to estimate the read, and these are both resolving the path down to the inode separately it is possible for the file to change in length if someone renames an updated version in between the two calls.This is low level enough, and used often enough by JGit, that I want it to robustly handle the file size changing when the lock file rename protocol was followed by a concurrent writer. Otherwise servers will fall over periodically when a concurrent writer races against a reader, and the reader will eventually get caught between the two path->inode translations.Go ask Sun why the felt it wasn't necessary to be able to determine the length of an open file from a FileInputStream using the fstat() system call. Blame them for needing to make us code defensively against this stupidity."

In fact because gzip and deflate are only different in the compressor and content type that are passed in, I probably would have gone with just a compressable stream class and passed those things into the constructor.    I would also drop the enum for compression type, as that is not compatible with polymorphism anyway. Just use the string mime type instead.I'll review again later this weekend and verify operation."

31114,0,"Patch Set 6: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisI have problems with this. I agree that the display of ORIG_HEAD, FETCH_HEAD and MERGE_HEAD should be avoided for the 99% of the cases. But I would say that they are nearly always important to be displayed when the point to objects which are otherwise unreferenced. My suggestion: By default always show them when they point to something which is not referenced by any other ref. And add a preference which allows me to show them always & never.Here is my argument: Even middle-experienced EGit users start doing rebases quite soon. If I am in the middle of a rebase I sometimes want to compare the state before I started the rebase operation to the current state. Without ORIG_HEAD the state where I startet rebase is lost.Another argument: Even the gerrit Web-UI suggest the usage of FETCH_HEAD. If I just want to look at a specific proposal I want to be able to inspect it locally without having to create and afterwards delete a temporary ref. FETCH_HEAD is perfect for that.You may say: that's your use-case but 99% of the normal users don't work like that and are beeing disturbed by these technical refs. My argument: Fine, if they don't work like that then they will never have ORIG_HEAD,MERGE_HEAD and FETCH_HEAD pointing to something which is otherwise unreferenced. Means: they will not see these refs with the default setting I propose."
31115,1,"Patch Set 6:In reply to Christians remarks:I can see the point with respect to the Refs that are not otherwise referenced (users may want to use them during a Rebase, for example). However, this whole thing started out by some colleague (and me) being irritated by exactly such References. You do a Rebase, it finishes, and suddenly you have that ORIG_HEAD thing popping into your face from the HistoryView. Instead of the nice linear history you wanted to achieve by the Rebase, you suddenly have something looking very much like two branches....I think that turning the toggle into some Always/Unreferenced/Never switch would confuse the poor user too much. They would have some branch on a commit and no white label, but once the branch moves to the next commit, the white label would magically appear?So perhaps the solution to this could be to make the Additional Refs visible by default and put a button close to the ""Show All Branches"" button so that users can more easily suppress the Refs? In other words, invert the flag to mean ""Suppress Additional Refs""?"

31450,1,"Patch Set 3:Ok, here's Round 2.  I think I hit all of the style issues from before, and addressed the commonBase problem we discussed.  I did it in a slightly different way than your suggestion, but I think it makes a little bit more sense given how the data comes into the generator.  Let me know if you see any problems with it.The generator should now return all commits up to the specified depth, ignoring any that were part of commonBase.  But it will correctly start returning any commits below the boundary of a previous shallow checkout, and return all commits at the old boundary as UNINTERESTING so that the PackWriter can exclude the right things from the pack.  As far as I can tell, this is correct behavior in all cases.I couldn't do the SEEN thing like I was planning on doing, because uninteresting commits get the flag set on them as well (as part of markStart()), so sometimes it's already present on commits in our queue even though we haven't added all their parents yet.  I reworked the depth stuff a bit and added some comments, hopefully making it clear enough that the depth sorting accomplishes the same thing.I'm cautiously optimistic that this is getting pretty close.  Please let me know if there's anything else that needs to be done to get this thing completely out the door."

31463,1,"Patch Set 8:There was a bad interaction between this patch, and a change that I added to PackWriter more recently. I had to turn off my reorder commits logic when a shallow clone is being used, because the reordering was packing parent commits that should not have been included in the pack. Not your fault, since the code is newer than the last version you touched in the patch. :-)I think I also busted shallow clone over smart HTTP. The server always crashes with an exception during the exchange, but it works correctly. Smart HTTP clients have an extra intermediate request that the UploadPack code isn't expecting. I'll try to get it fixed just so we don't have the exception showing up in server logs."
31464,1,"Patch Set 5:Woo hoo, I managed to sneak away to work on this for a little bit! :)This should fix all of the style issues Shawn mentioned in the previous one.

31468,1,"Patch Set 7: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; Unclean IP, do not check inPatch set 7 looks good to me. The extra commits was caused by the resorting process done during a normal pack creation.

While this may be a valuablecontribution to execute these tests with multiple merge strategies,it seems like this doesn't directly help for the issue you are fixing with thischange.  I would rather propose to split your change into two changes:- one which introduces the testMergeSuccessAllStrategies and fixes the ClassCastException- one which converts several other tests into theories in order to improve the quality of the tests in general"

31549,1,"Patch Set 3:ok, this looks betterI found a use case where ""select all"" / ""deselect all"" would be more useful than ""toggle selection"":Suppose I have 17 repos in the list and 8 are already checked, now I want to just search one repo which is not yet selected, toggle selection is not useful here as it would select the 9 repos which weren't selected previously, so I need to click a lot of check boxes to reach what I want.In this case the cheapest path would require 9 clicks (deselect 8 and select one).Using ""deselect all"" button I could reach what I want with just 2 clicks.Hence I would vote for replacing the ""toggle selection"" by ""select all"" / ""deselect all"" buttons, this pattern is also used in import projects wizard."
31551,1,Patch Set 7:I darkened the check mark. I would prefer to keep them the current size since it is the same size as the collapse all and expand all icons used in toolbar buttons throughout Eclipse.
31556,1,Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisThe invalid file mode bug has been fixed.  Unstaging however seems completely broken.  When I unstage a change the index is updated to a blob which matches the working tree instead of HEAD so 'git status' doesn't see any change but the change is there in the working tree.  I'm quite confused by this behaviour and have tried a few variations of the implementation but can't find the bug.
31560,0,"Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this(2 inline comments)I like the idea of this feature! I wonder if this could replace ""Synchronize..."" on projects and we move the full-fledged Synchronize Action into the Repository view instead of the team menu."

31580,1,"Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this(15 inline comments)I did some testing and compared this view with the staging/commit view provided by GitX.I think the UI should rather follow what GitX does, I think this is close to optimal.I would propose to do the following changes:- add a combo to select the repository, if you feel you really need a way to have a staging view for all repositories add an entry ""<all>"" to this combo, I think looking at staged changes for multiple repos isn't really useful and requires more scrolling- divide the staging view horizontally into three panes in the same way as GitX does:   - list of unstaged files in the left pane, decorate modified, deleted, untracked files with different decorators, this removes the need for a lot of tree nodes   - draft for commit message in the middle (could reuse the new stuff done by Kevin)   - list of staged change on the right side, decorate to show details about staged changes- I would prefer flat file lists as this removes the need to open/collapse unnecessary tree nodes which also eat up vertical screen real estate (compare the two screenshots I attached to bug 313263 comparing current EGit proposal and GitX)"
31582,0,"Patch Set 5: I would prefer that you didn't submit this(1 inline comment)rebased to adapt build to new target version 1.0.0I like this approach it looks much better now :-)Mainly since the layout is much more clear and has the right focus for the task we want to accomplish with the staging viewI also like the idea to use the current selection to decide which repo is of interest.Though some ideas for further improvement:- the staging view should have an explicit label showing for which repository the status is currently being displayed- the staging view should also follow if the focus is set on a repository using the repositories view- the file lists should be sorted, maybe there could be options for different sorting criteria (alphabetically, file status)- on a big screen this layout works well on a small laptop screen we need a way to see the full path of the files in the lists, this requires more horizontal real estate for the file lists (maybe we could have an option to stack the two lists vertically) or we make the lists themselves more compact by something similar to compressed package option in package explorer"
31585,1,"Patch Set 7:The commit pane still grabs more horizontal space than necessary according to auto-wrapping limit.The vertical distance between the checkboxes isn't consistent (the bottom one has a bit larger distance).Drag&Drop doesn't yet work, right ?I noticed that when a project shared with git is selected and then the staging view is opened via ""Window > Show View > Git > Staging View"" the selection isn't used to fill the staging view initially, so you have to click the project again to get the staging view filled with the data for the repository this project is in.Adding Jens as a reviewer to comment on your last two open points."

31591,1,Patch Set 10: (5 inline comments)Staging view is a great thing. I like the UI layout.I have some concerns regarding the update of the staging view using reload (calculating IndexDiff). IndexDiff.diff is very expensive on big repos. On the other hand IndexChangedEvent / RefsChangedEvent occur in many situations. So I'm not sure if it's feasible to update the view based on these events.

31602,1,"Patch Set 2:Dariusz, I'm sorry but I cannot reproduce the NPE with closed projects. But it makes sense to not give out null Traversals, they're now removed in the current patchset. Could you try to reproduce the problem?Fixed style nit."

31649,1,Patch Set 3:- ACK now can open compare on untracked file- I think CommitFileDiffViewer.showTwoWayFileDiff(final FileDiff d) shows how to open compare view with reusing the compare view (that's what is used when double clicking on a file entry in a commit's file list in History View when compare mode is enabled in order to bring up the compare view)- for unstage support in jgit have a look at IndexDiffTest.removeFromIndex(String path)I think this should do the trick
31650,1,"Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit thislooks quite good, but some things could still be improved (your choice if you do this in this change or a later one):- can't open compare view on untracked file but on deleted file, to not surprise users this should be also possible on untracked files- staging view doesn't recognize if a new (hence untracked file) is created or an existing one is modified and saved- I think by default compare view should be reused so that you don't end up with lots of these views when inspecting the current status. There could be a toggle to pin compare view so that subsequent double click would add a new compare view for the next file.- when compare view is already open and not pinned selecting another file in staging view could automatically update the compare view. This would save one click per file navigation.- staging through drag&drop doesn't yet work (don't know if it should already)"

If they are all the same repository then there's no harm. If there are multiple repos then we might disable, or could show common names. For example, I might naively think I have to select all EGit projects to switch to another branch, or in the future, you might want to switch all EGit and JGit projects to the 0.11 branch. Although the branch would be different in each case they have the same name. The entry set could give branches in arbitrary order if I read this correctly. If so, can we sort?The comment in the single arg constrictor has ""default constructor"" which seems to be a cut and paste from the single arg version. The other menu should probably be disabled in the case of multiple projects being selected with individual repositories."

N=2560000, D=4210, time/(N*D):2E0, time/(N*D^2):4.76E-4   testPatience 1280000 bytes took   3022629000 ns. N=2560000, D=793, time/(N*D):1.49E0, time/(N*D^2):1.88E-3This tells us that Patience diff can be even faster then Myers. But even more interesting to me is the value for D (the size of the found edit-script). PatienceDiff found an 5 times lesser edits than myers. I won't say that smaller edit-scripts (with probably huger regions) are better, but my big hope is that PatienceDiff brings ""better diffs"" regarding readability by humans. We should have tests with real-world content which proof that. Tests which show better quality of the diffs as listed here: http://bramcohen.livejournal.com/73318.html"
32062,1,"Patch Set 6: (5 inline comments)FWIW, I'm still not done speeding up PatienceDiff.  I think we can do even better than we are doing right now.  Some of the ideas may even be leveraged back into MyersDiff.  I just haven't thought about doing that yet because its still a big ugly black box to me.Coming up with D=793 on PatienceDiff when MyersDiff comes up with D=4210 is because we are only looking at unique common lines.  When PatienceDiff cannot find a unique line in a region, it just bails and does a giant replace, while MyersDiff continues to look for context.If we plugged in MyersDiff at this point as a fallback, we should get D=4210 again.  But I'm not sure that is the best immediate fallback strategy.  We could instead build a histogram of the common lines and pick the least duplicated common lines and try to find the LCS around those.  By using least duplicated we should still avoid nasty cases like ""\t}\n"" as being an anchor point for the matching, but would still be able to break out of the degenerate case.Thus far I have done only very limited testing of PatienceDiff on real-world input.  I did wire it into DiffFormatter and run `jgit log -p` to scan through the diffs.  I didn't see any obvious variations from MyersDiff, but I don't think recent JGit history is a poster child for where patience diff is supposed to produce more readable results.In case you didn't know, my motivation behind PatienceDiff was to find another solution to Gerrit issue 487 [1], infinite loop in MyersDiff.  Unfortunately patience diff really fails on single-character sequences (due to insufficient common unique points), but the algorithm is trivially simple and easy to prove that it will terminate.  I'm probably going to try and do a word-level variant of RawText and see if we can get a word-level thing to work better under PatienceDiff for the intraline difference coloring in Gerrit.Also, MyersDiff is really slow for Gerrit.  For some patches it takes 2.5s to display the page.  Of that 2.5s, 2.450s is spent in MyersDiff doing the intraline work.  Getting a faster algorithm under it would be nice.[1] http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=487"

32124,0,"Patch Set 3:RCS working only if the IDE Windows is active: this is very useful.On testing, I got some strange effects:1. Create a new file x in the IDE and add it to Git.If you change x outside Eclipse, the repo scan triggers an indexChanged event and x is refreshed2. Change a file y that is in repo outside the IDE.The repo scan does not get this change, no refresh is performed.I think all external changes to resources should be refreshed or no change.GitLighweightDecorator listens to repo changes. So when refresh stuff is turned of, still changes like staged, branch change etc are shown to the user. Just the dirty information is missing and external changes are not refreshed. Reacting to external changes is provided by setting ""refresh automatically"", so this should be used for any kind of external change (you mentioned ""refresh automatically"" has a too long delay until it works).Summary: I have some doubts if it is the right way to refresh resources based on Git Repo eventing because not all external content changes in the working tree are detected.Furthermore this EGit refresh mechanism somehow does the Job of a standard mechanism (""refresh automatically"")."

32213,0,"Patch Set 4: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completedI think we want this in 0.9 because otherwise large objects stored as deltas in packs can be incredibly slow to access, especially if they are accessed often.The downside is, when checking out a large object into the local working directory, we're also deflating it as a loose object just in case we need to re-read that content in the future.  Large binary objects are probably less frequently modified by the user in the working directory, so we're probably less likely to actually need this faster access.  So we might be doing too much work in some cases.But for a gerrit code review server serving large binary files, this really helps, because users of the server tend to access the same objects several times before the next git gc runs."

Since we're in incubation, it doesn't matter - but either way, it probably makes sense for this class to be in an internal package rather than part of the API, if it's a public package (which it looks like it is)."

Did Jetty make an incompatible API change in a service release?"
32425,1,"Patch Set 1: No scoreI get the compile errors when using Eclipse 3.6M7 Helios - the RCP distribution. I then added Jetty from the Eclipse RT project. In 3.6M7, Jetty is at 7.1 but in M6 it was at 7.02 and did not have the new Logger interface. The problem we face is that any potential contributor who has a fully up to date Helios environment will encounter this problem when they build under Eclipse. The Maven builds will not be affected because you reference specific versions in them."

32482,1,"Patch Set 1:The problem with this is we have 3 almost identical methods, each of which does subtly different things, and they're already diverging. there's a mixture of int n and long n, and some arguments have final size and the others don't.The only difference appears to be whether we write it into a temporary buffer, and what method gets called in the middle of the loop (fillInFromFile, fillInFromStream). We could parameterise that to the same function and delegate based on a switch (e.g. fillInFrom(FILE), fillInFrom(STREAM) and then code if( from==FILE)fillInFromFile() else (if from = STREAM) fillInFromStream() so we only need this implementation once. Or, we could pass in a class (FillInSource) and have that delegated to.Either way, I think the duplicate looping logic should be removed so that when there's a future error, we only do it once, and it can be detected appropriately (and means we only have one place to fix in the future)."

I think we should rather refer to them via plugin dependencies.- some images are missing:  - images for previous, next and EGit User Guide links in headers and footers of all documentation pages  - images for topic ""Committing changes"" are all missing- I think the doc plugin should be added to the EGit feature"

I recognized this since I had the working copy open in an editor and bringing up the compare view turned the editor to the dirty state.

My opinion is, we're not freezing any APIs until we release 1.0.0.  Until then we may rip up APIs during a 0.x to 0.(x+1) release, so we should scope that way, and anyone linking to us should assume that same risk.Part of the problem I have though is the foundation encourages a 2 year commitment to supporting published APIs.  I really don't want to make a 2 year commitment to supporting some of the crap we still have in the library..."

It's part of the Eclipse Dynamic Languages Kit (DLK) and comes from the eclipse repo, so I don't think that would cause trouble. In theory that belongs only in releng, but we do have the standalong generator script as well. What do you think?FYI, in April I sent a message to the Xtext forum asking for clarification on the IP issues (https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php?t=tree&th=1076793&goto=1730152&#msg_1730152)The message has a summary of what I found.

The TPD editor is one thing, because it's pretty much absolutely required to generate a correct target platform.  Not so much this shell editor.  I don't want to keep piling in more and more editors and other tools for this or that developer's preference.It's quite easy to maintain a local setup of your favourite tools and combine that with the RT setup to build your environment.  That's what I do, myself, for a variety of other Eclipse plug-ins that I use but aren't actually required for Papyrus-RT development. > The message has a summary of what I found.

The patch does not change the problem root cause (unbalanced API usage on client side), but tries to reduce the side effects of API misuse. > e.g., if there are unbalanced calls to increment and decrement the > use count, doesn't that lead to doClose being called too early?Before the patch ""bad"" part of client code could make lot of unmatched ""close()"" calls and the next ""good"" part of client code would leak files handles.After the patch, the ""bad"" client code could call as many close() as it will, the next ""good"" part of the client code would behave as expected.Before the patch:1) close() > incrementAndGet(), next incrementAndGet(): illegal system state,  next close() will left open file handles.2) close() < incrementAndGet(), next incrementAndGet(): open file handles.3) incrementAndGet() > close() + 1, next close(): open file handles.4) incrementAndGet() < close(), next close(): illegal system state, next incrementAndGet() will left open file handles.By correct API use after any points above we have unpredictable system behavior where the file handles could stay open unconditionally.After the patch:1) close() > incrementAndGet(), next incrementAndGet(): correct system state.2) close() < incrementAndGet(), next incrementAndGet(): open file handles.3) incrementAndGet() > close() + 1, next close(): open file handles.4) incrementAndGet() < close(), next close(): correct system state.By correct API use, only after points 2 and 3 above we have unpredictable system behavior where the file handles could stay open unconditionally.So after the patch we reduce the probability that system goes into the unpredictable state."

Equinox DS provides the osgi.extender capability since Neon M4. Now the e4 bundles can specify Require-Capability to that osgi.extender. If the capabilities are configured correctly, the former implicit dependency to DS becomes an explicit dependency and the auto start configuration for the ds bundle shouldn't be necessary anymore.Does that makes sense?"

At the moment I would prefer this is not submitted, as although it passed the tests on the build machine, tests in SourceLookupTest (specifically sourceSubstituteChanges and sourceSubstituteAdded) now fail intermittently when I run the tests. This is because the operation has stopped being atomic by changing it from a Query to a DsfRunnable.That said, I am aware their is a tradeoff between locking the entire GUI (VERY BAD!) and a corner case of source lookup changes not working. I will take a of additional time to investigate and understand the alternatives a bit better, including seeing if I can extract the issues as additional tests."

Even intentionally calling fChart.dispose() twice does not cause an exception.So I suspect it is some other user code that is accessing the Chart after it has been disposed (probably delayed through a Runnable where shutdown happens in the meantime) and that is where the protection should be added. I'm not sure the added check here would prevent the exception."

The difference here is that the component registering the listener is not necessarily a view, it can be an analysis parameter provider, for instance for some analysis like the critical path who respond to a selection in the control flow view. In that case, there is no getSite().etcStill, that may not be the recommended way to do this, but it works. Any idea?"

34011,0,Patch Set 5:Let's move the discussion back to the task and remove the milestone for now. It's not clear to me where we are going with the statistics tracking and I'd like to see a more generic solution than adding a few properties here and there. There should be an abstraction that makes it obvious what statistics are tracked and that encapsulates the persistence. Using properties seems okay to me but we could consider GSon for persistence for example.

34136,0,"Patch Set 2:(1 comment)Tomek, I think you're exactly right. It looks like we've been getting false positives all along for whether reviews need to be updated or not. As far as I can tell, we'd always be updating reviews. This could explain the rather hyper-active updating we've been seeing. And yeah, we should look at the tests as they seem to be expecting one too many updates. But we need to be careful to test this change in UI as it could have significant consequences. (Note that by default, we simply returned true in all cases for model updates as that is the ""safe"" strategy -- you shouldn't be able to screw anything up by over-reporting your need for an update but you could by under-reporting it.)"
34137,1,"Patch Set 2:The plot thickens a bit. Looking further at the code, it appears that what was actually happening was that the false positive was masking a failure to request an update for when reviewer changes occurred. As w/ dependencies, it seems that adding a reviewer may not actually case the modification date to be updated. So I think that isModelUpdated will need to be modified to test that the number of current reviewers matches the number of expected reviewers.At some point this becomes a bit of a performance question, because by the time we make all of the API calls to determine whether an update should occur, we may have made enough calls to actually just go ahead and update the review! So we end up making a number of calls twice. Instead we might look at always returning true here, and checking for deltas in updateModel and returning false if there aren't any. (Right now we just assume that if updateModel is called, that updates have in fact occurred.) But that's a big change and probably not something to consider now."

My opinion is all the contrary: if we manage to get ""trusted"" HEAD of Git, then we can have continuous releases, user get access to fix sooner and many other issues discussed here and there become invalid since other projects wouldn't have to set up workarounds.

34342,1,Patch Set 1:This seem to hurt LT proxy design. I'm not certain how to handle this change too. So lets discuss some ideas.I think it should be designed as:1. Create a new interface org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.IRemoteConnection2. Provides an implementation of IRemoteConnection for local connections (org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.LocalConnection)3. Your RDTConnection goes to package org.eclipse.linuxtools.internal.rdt.proxy. It should implement the IRemoteConnection interface too.4. The method RDTConnection#getConnectionsName goes to org.eclipse.linuxtools.internal.rdt.proxy.RDTProxyManager. Perhaps it should return a list of IRemoteConnection instead of the connections name. Notice that RDTProxyManager has already a getConnection(uri) method5. Finally create a method in org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.RemoteProxyManager to return either LocalConnection or RDTConnection based upon the URI and/or IProject.Notice that org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch has already two classes about remote connection: RemoteConnection and RemoteConnectionException.

34719,1,"Patch Set 1:This change follows up (and depends on) review 54318.The GMF Notation model has a peculiar structure in the View::element reference, which is ""unsettable"" in the EMF feature sense of supporting a separate ""unset"" state and which has a default value that is derived from the element references of the parent view chain.To support AOF bindings and other operations on such references, the AOF needs to support this ""unset"" state explicitly.  As the EMF implementation of the AOF represents all scalar features as IOnes, and as the IOne interface already provides a default value, it seemed useful to add an ""isDefault"" API to IOne in order to let clients know when the box's value is defaulted.  The EMF implementation of the IOne for scalar features takes account of the unset state and exposes it in this new API.  The One class and its delegate likewise provide the default state for other domains.New JUnit tests are included for simple scenarios in the EMF domain and the core AOF."
34721,1,"Patch Set 1:This patch follows up on and depends on review 54635.The IObservable APIs for adding and removing observers are too restrictive of the observer type (because IObserver is parameterized).

Client code can accidentally add elements to these boxes such that they will not longer be empty.This patch remedies the problem by introducing a general facility for immutable boxes.  A new Boxes utility class, analogous to java.util.Collections, adds true constants for empty boxes, as well as convenience API for construction of other immutable boxes.Other new utility APIs in support of the immutable boxes are* a proper Java enum (supporting switch statements) for the kinds of constraints* EMF-like switch utilities for IConstraints and IBoxIncludes complete test coverage."

35050,1,AbandonedI'm rebasing this as change 50462 on the new Mars maintenance branch.
35052,1,"Patch Set 1:This is a new Gerrit review presenting a variation of change 38587 that fixes the problem of every regeneration of the tests producing code in a new random order, which I discussed on the Papyrus-Dev mailing list. This is accomplished primarily by a verbatim translation of the QVTo transformation steps to Xtend language.  The overall design of the transformation pipeline is the same as before:  in particular, the UML models are the same.  It's just the language in which the transformations are specified that has been changed.Xtend exposes list values in UML models in their native EList terms, which affords stable and predictable ordering of transformation operations and, hence, test model structure and generated code.  It also provides for more concise, debuggable, searchable, and performant transformations with better Java integration.  On the subject of performance:  a comparison of the QVTo version against the equivalent Xtend version, averaged over 5 runs after a couple of warm-ups with the longest run discarded finds that the Xtend version runs more than twice as fast:  49.75 seconds as compared to 117.25 seconds.  This is including the M2T code-generation step that is the same Xtend in both cases and XMI identifier generation which is unique to the Xtend implementation of the UML transformations.  But, to me this is a bonus, not the important factor:  it's the tooling support and stability of the transformation that are most significant.A new UMLWriter workflow component is employed to assign predictable, stable XMI identifiers to elements of generated UML models to avoid unnecessary diffs in source control when re-generating.  (somewhat moot now that the models are no longer in git)This patch set also regenerates the test code from the Xtend version of the framework. I have git-ignored the generated UTP source models because they reference and depend on UML instance models of the GMFGens that are already git-ignored, so there's no point in having these in git.  Besides that they are now much larger because of the generated unique XMI IDs.I welcome any feed-back you may have on the question of whether we should adopt this Xtend-based transformation or continue with the QVTo implementation.  I do want to continue adding more synchronization test cases to complete the coverage of that new capability, so it would be nice to do that only in one or the other variant of the test framework.  ;-)"
35053,1,"Patch Set 1:Also, I think it's worth noting that the (rather trivial, actually) exercise of translating from QVTo to Xtend picked up some problems that the QVTo language makes it easy to miss.  For example:* strings concatenated accidentally that were supposed to be separated in a list by commas (in the lists of edit-parts to test)* some GMFGen models have one or more GenNodes that don't have a model facet, resulting in stuff silently not happening in QVTo but more noisy with Xtend (requiring action to adapt the transformation logic)"
35054,1,"Patch Set 4:Patch set 4 reduces the amount of boilerplate code in the Xtend GMFGen-to-UTP transformation considerably and improves readability, by developing a small DSL for declaration of transformation rules for test contexts and assembly into packages.  This uses new active annotations which, owing to a logistical limitation of Xtend, must be defined in a new separate plug-in project."
35056,1,"Patch Set 5:Finally! I have fixed the generation of the wrong diagram-updater instance field reference for Sequence Diagram, which as a legacy diagram still uses TYPED_INSTANCE.  This employs a class-file scanning hack that is potentially expensive in I/O, so it uses a new @Cached active annotation that caches method computation results.Now the entire code-generation run generates no compilation errors that need to be fixed up afterwards and repeated runs produce no diffs.  The stage is set for completion of the generation of synchronization tests."

Eclipse provides an extension point for that to define context sensitive help which can be opened from a view, dialog, wizard etc. The context sensitive help opens the relevant chapters in the User Guide.

In the flags given to sys_clone, we can check if the CLONE_THREAD bit is set. From there, we can set TGID accordingly (to child_tid if it's a new process, to parent_tid if it's a new thread). This should work for all LTTng 2.x versions.FYI, the CLONE_THREAD bit position has not changed since the clone system call appeared in the Linux kernel 2.4, so I think it is safe to say it won't change in a near future."

If this was done to give dirty editors chance to save their content - this doesn't work either, because first of all user denied once that he won't save it and second because the editor immediately recognize that resource is gone and simply stops to render the content and shows ""file does not exist"" error.The good news: with https://git.eclipse.org/r/41675 patch dirty editors of closed project will be closed too.Not so good news: this works only for projects closed with the ""standard"" CloseResourceAction - all other ""closing"" possibilities (custom actions or direct API use) will still not close the editor.So I think this change still makes sense."

35569,0,Patch Set 3:Have you thought about adding your hook support to a more generic place? All your hooks are implemented in the jgit/api package. But users of JGit are not forced to use this package. If components like gerrit or gitblit use jgit on a more low-level (but still public) level than they would have no hooks support. E.g. look at RepoCommand.java. They creating commits with CommitBuilder and ObjectInserter but they would have no hooks support. Maybe somewhere in ObjectInserter.insert(CommitBuilder) would be a good place. But we have to take care that we don't call hooks for commits which come in e.g. through transport.
35570,1,"Patch Set 3:No, I have not considered it :). The right place for me was in the commands themselves, I didn't really think further ahead...I don't think the hooks have their place in such low-levels though... Someone who wishes to use the ObjectInserter directly probably doesn't want external processes to kick-in... not to mention the hooks themselves expect to be run in a particular environment; most notably, in an environment where the repository isn't locked (.git/index.lock doesn't exist). A hook (for example, post-commit) could very well checkout another branch, copy create a copy of the commit there, then re-checkout the original branch. On the other hand, CommitBuilder shouldn't be used without having locked the repo beforehand IIUC.Likewise, the pre-commit hook can ""block"" a commit entirely, which wouldn't be possible without some hickups if done too low-level : the CommitCommand, RebaseCommand, CherrypickCommand... or anything called by EGit might setup some preparation on the repository before calling the lower level ObjectInserter... but if the hook rejects the commit, all of this setup is not only useless but needs to be reverted.I'll try and pull them down a few level if you think that's necessary, but I don't really know how to do it cleanly."

Also, the CSS plug-in itself was renamed/refactored, resulting in lots of files moved.  Why?  This makes it very difficult to review the change.Can we take this a step at a time, starting by just factoring out the specific releng changes needed for integration of MWE2 and Xtend into the build for this plug-in?

Why not in this case?  Or are we free now to introduce more POM hierarchy for other purposes?  That would be fine with me; I just thought that was not currently policy.  Also, I'm concerned that we're adding POM files that aren't maintained within the Eclipse projects and are therefore not easily managed within the Eclipse environment (they are only accessible in the Git directories).  For example, there isn't a plugins/infra/gmfdiag/css/xtext/.project file to create an Eclipse project that makes the pom.xml accessible within Eclipse.Any comment on the site.xml and xdoc files that look like auto-generated stubs?  AFAIK, we don't use these in Papyrus.  And all of the files that are changed in plug-ins that aren't generated?What I was hoping to see was common infrastructure that I could re-use in my own Xtend projects to simplify their build configuration (which, granted, isn't exactly complex:  the xtend-maven-plugin is quite simple).

There's just the pattern established when Tycho was first implemented in Papyrus and some discussions on the mailing list and conference calls that I remember (or perhaps misremember).

35823,1,"Patch Set 2:Here's one problem I have when using it (I need this for the virtual machine view): this method is good for the zoomed event list, but I want to call it for both zoomed and not zoomed (complete range) event list. There could be a method that returns a flat map of <entry, event list>, and then the recursive call could call the setZoomedEventList for all entries, but then the events will not be set for the entries until the end and we cannot draw anything until everything is calculated.Some questions: 1- why do we use TimeGraphEntry here instead of ITimeGraphEntry to which we could add a setEventList?2- Why do we have a set of zoomed events and another one for the full range? Isn't the full range just a special case of the zoomed events? And doesn't that complicate the whole thing uselessly? Is it just to cache to full range data because we suppose it may be used more than once, while each zoom range is pretty much unique?Now that we don't have to live with the legacy API... could we break it here? :D"
35824,1,"Patch Set 2:> 1- why do we use TimeGraphEntry here instead of ITimeGraphEntry to which we could add a setEventList?I guess a combination of wanting to leave the 'how the list is stored' completely up to the implementation (that was before abstract view), and avoiding API breakage. I don't mind if we add a setter now.> 2- Why do we have a set of zoomed events and another one for the full range? Isn't the full range just a special case of the zoomed events? And doesn't that complicate the whole thing uselessly? Is it just to cache to full range data because we suppose it may be used more than once, while each zoom range is pretty much unique?There are two reasons for the two lists. One is that when you zoom out completely (a common case) the list is already available. The other is that when you scroll and zoom out you have 'some' level of detail before you settle on a new window range and the new zoomed list is computed. Otherwise everything outside of the old window range would be completely blank, and you would be scrolling 'in the dark' (e.g. when you drag the scroll bar thumb).I can see two cases where you only need one list. First is if you know that your data is small enough, you can have only the full list computed without any resolution gaps, then you don't need any zoomed list. The second is if you want to have only the current window visible data, then you can avoid the full range list -- with the caveat explained above (note that in this case, setting the zoom range to null when zooming to full range would be a bad idea...)."

FooExtension could be even dropped in some major release.b) class AbstractA implements Adaptable {}, class A extends AbstractA implements Adaptable {} - most likely Adaptable was added to AbstractA after the class was created, but it is not necessary it stays there forever, but in any case we want A be adaptable.So, I don't think we have to this cleanup."

35910,1,"Patch Set 1: Verified+1Uwe,the patch itself looks good. Unfortunately, there is nobody working full time on p2, and I am not very familiar with the codebase you touched.I would deeply appreciate if you could tell me what is the effect of skipping certain notifications - your patch removes NPE but it would be good to know that it fixes the real problem, not just hiding it."
35911,1,"Patch Set 1:Daniel,the underlying problem is that notifications occur before the initialization of the variables ÔÇ£artifactReposForRemovalÔÇØ and ÔÇ£metadataReposForRemovalÔÇØ has been completed. It is a timing issue as far as I can say, as the NPEÔÇÖs does not happen all the time. And if the NPEÔÇÖs occur, everything is installed/uninstalled just fine, except that the users get a little bit worried as there are exceptions in the install log.If you look at DirectorApplication#run (line 1080 and following), ÔÇ£initializeServices()ÔÇØ is called at line 1088 which does register the provisioning event bus listener at the end of that method. At this point of time, ÔÇ£initializeRepositories()ÔÇØ (called at line 1095) hasnÔÇÖt been called yet and therefore both variables are still null. If there is an incoming notification before ÔÇ£initializeRepositories()ÔÇØ is fully processed, you run in the NPE. Once ÔÇ£initializeRepositories()ÔÇØ is called, the notifications are processed without triggering an NPE.The proposed fix is the simplest approach without changing the original control flow of the DirectorApplication. Obviously it would be also possible to do the registration of the provisioning event bus listener after the call to ÔÇ£initializeRepositories()ÔÇØ, but this will modify the control flow of the DirectorApplication slightly. IÔÇÖm open for any suggestion and can also provide a patch that moves the provisioning event bus registration after ÔÇ£initializeRepositories()ÔÇØ."

35946,0,Patch Set 1:When running maven builds it's sometimes desirable to validate the compilation of the tests.dsf.gdb plugin but don't actually execute this specific test cases but other ones which are part of the build reactor.This small change introduces a new parameter (don't skip by default) that allows skipping of this test cases if specified in the mvn command.
35948,1,Patch Set 2:Patch set two adds comments in the commit message as suggested.An specific example:Lets say that you can not run the test cases in test.dsf.gdb in a very specific environment. However you could replace these tests cases with an extension of these test cases or a customized version based on this open source bundle.So when running your builds you want to know if the original  tests.dsf.gdb still compiles as you need to re-base you custom test cases at a later point. So you would add this open source module to your build.However you don't want to run the open source test cases as they would fail in the custom environment but you still want to execute the extended version so you don't want to skip al tests either.So the option is to simple skip the test cases for the tests.dsf.gdb bundle and leave it on for other tests bundles.  The new system parameter does just that without affecting the current behavior.Let me know in case you have any concerns

36189,1,Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1I think you should update the Sequence documentation to mention the snap to geometry (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=431035#c1) as Sequence does not suport sequence element to be aligned and the blue line feedback indicates there will be some insertion/auto expand in Sequence diagrams. Then we should open a new bug to force the deactivation and forbid the enablement of snap to grid and snap to shapes on SequenceDiagrams. (see in org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui.graphical.edit.policies.SiriusContainerEditPolicy.getArrangeCommand(ArrangeRequest) how to access to the pref value for each diagram).

36238,0,"Patch Set 1:A further change in how Model Explorer manages refresh, to avoid recalculating the entire tree structure on every model edit, which doesn't scale well on large models.First, the Model Explorer's resource-set listener now only schedules structural refreshes for the specific objects that notified changes.Second, the UMLLabelProvider fires LabelProviderChangedEvents to trigger label updates for elements that derive their labels from other related elements, when those related elements are changed.  This required a new mix-in interface for label providers in the Label Provider Service to allow Model Explorer and other clients to pass notifications to them on changes in the model.  I'm not entirely happy with this solution, but it does address a couple of issues with the approach I would rather have taken, which is having individual label providers listen for model changes themselves:  * the providers registered with the Label Provider Service aren't initialized with a    ResourceSet, ServicesRegistry, or other context in which they can find the    model to listen to  * providers could discover, as they are asked to provide labels, the objects they    need to listen to.  But should they be Adapters or ResourceSetListeners?  And    can we be sure that they won't leak, that the providers will be disposed at the    right time so that they can remove listeners/adapters?  * only the Model Explorer (for now) needs label providers to trigger updates.    Element-picker dialogs and other widgets in the Properties view, for example,    don't have this need, so this design ensures that the large number of other    UMLLabelProviders that are created (there are lots) don't all listen for model    changes    I am willing to explore this alternative further if reviewers agree that the new IDependentLabelProvider interface isn't a great thing.Another point that I'm not sure about is the changes in the SemanticUMLContentProvider to prevent addition/removal of stereotype applications from a resource triggering complete refresh of the Model Explorer.  I don't know in what contexts this might break some UI that depends on that refresh trigger.  The consequence of reverting the SemanticUMLContentProvider changes is only that applying/unapplying stereotypes results in a long lag in the UI on large models as the Model Explorer refreshes itself.  This may be acceptable; comment is welcome."
36239,1,"Patch Set 2:I've updated the change set to remove the IDependentLabelProvider that I didn't like.  Instead, now the UMLLabelProvider is a service that acts as a subordinate of the LabelProviderService.  When instantiated as a service, it uses a new UMLLabelDependenciesService to efficiently listen for changes in the resource set and compute objects that need to have labels updated.  When not installed as a service (which is also commonly the case), then none of this machinery is engaged.I like this better because it doesn't introduce new API and lets the label provider take care of its own concerns, which is as it should be."
36240,0,"AbandonedTaking another approach, improving the intrinsic performance of EMF Facet (which apparently lost some optimizations in the 0.1->0.2 refactoring), shows promise.

The JUnitBenchmark library looks very interesting at a first glance. However, in my opinion we should delay this patch to RMF 0.9.0, because:(1) the patch using JUnitBenchmarks requires at least junit 4.9. However, the current RMF target platform includes version 4.8.2 (which is part of the Eclipse JDT v.3.7.2). Plese note: Our current build is still based on eclipse 3.7 (indigo). Nevertheless, the orbit update site includes junit 4.10, which could be used as well.@ Fran├ºois: Do you use the RMF indigo target development definition?(2) Our plan is to build RMF 0.9.0 on top of Kepler. The Kepler update site includes a newer version of JDT as well as a newer version of Junit.(3) I guess, that the JUnitBenchmark library is not part of the Eclipse Orbit Project. As a consequence, we need a CQ for the library, especially for the customized version for working with OSGI.

I think UserMenu.js needs to keep calling getAuthForm(url) to provide the redirect, but maybe `url` should always be the location of index.html, which would prevent any  user-specific information in the page URL from being preserved across logins. But (as usual, sigh) UserMenu.js isn't supposed to know about specific page URLs since they're contributed dynamically through plugins.So I guess we have to designate a special orion.page.link extension as giving the URL of the index page, add the extension to pageLinksPlugin.js, then lookup that extension from UserMenu.js to obtain the index page URL.Anyone have a better idea? :-|"

I also like the possiblity to have a list instead of the tree.(-)It breaks with the consistent Eclipse usage one is used to. That is, e.g. the feature to mark duplicate ids should be embedded more Eclipse style s.t. it integrates into the problems view etc. I like the feature to jump to the entries in the tree and the source, again, this should be solved the eclipse way. Repair and Mark should be applicable to the tree.The argument requirement org.eclipse.e4.tools.modeleditor.utilitytab.enabled is a no go.I like the patch, I don't like that it breaks with the way one is used to use Eclipse and I think the functionality embedded should be integrated in other ways.

36595,1,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1(1 comment)I would prefer if we removed completely the concept of bookmarks file from the interfaces and instead use the editor's input. The file in the FileEditorInput is always the file used for storing bookmarks.How about a solution where the TmfTraceManager has a static method to return the editor associated with an opened trace? Then you can easily get the file from the editor input. Or the TmfTraceManager could return the file directly.Note that if you are using the TimeChartView, you can already get the bookmarks file from the TimeChartDecorationProvider associated with the trace. It is stored when the trace is opened from the signal's getBookmarksFile(), or when the view is opened from the editor's getBookmarksFile(). But both of these methods could be removed if we use the editor input or the new suggested method from TmfTraceManager instead."

Smaller patches means it's easier to review, easier to bisect, revert if needed, etc., but more importantly, it really shows the logical progression and tells the reviewers where they should be looking at first.I think this could be easily split in:* Add the ""xychart"" package and the base TmfXYChartViewer, as well as the dependencies in the manifest* Add the TmfBarChartViewer and its related classes (they could go in a xychart.barchart package, but it doesn't really matter.)* Add the tracing.examples plugin, with its settings (but no contents)* Add the NewHistogramView(I myself still have many huge patches I will try to break down in the next couple days, like the null-annotations one.)I like the notion of an ""examples"" plugin, it's very useful for prototyping, but can serve as kind of staging for ""real"" views.

We could build a command infrastructure, but that's what EMF edit is for. But it's too ambitious to put in edit support yet.2. This is a special easy to justify case in that a) the behaviour is purely structural and b) occurs at object creation time.

37611,1,"Patch Set 1:If the field is immutable (which means its contents cannot be modified, like Strings), a shallow copy is safe.In the case of a CtfLocation, the field type CtfLocationData is immutable. Its two fields are final. So another object having a pointer to the same object could not modify it, they'd have to create a new one.Although for TmfLocation, I agree there is no guarantee. We do not control all possible implementations, like with CtfLocation. I did add a comment in the Javadoc description, but it's probably not enough.I will re-spin the patch to do a deep-copy in TmfLocation. But I still think we can do a shallow-copy in CtfLocation, since we control CtfLocationData and we know it's immutable, and it'd be faster to do so."

I like the fact that it's dead simple (if there's a conflict, it replaces with the new one. User's fault). But then you have to make sure you cache the hashmap lookups and don't do them every query..."

TmfEventsView.fExperiment: It should be cleared in the experiment disposed handler2. TmfRawEventViewer.fTrace: TmfEventsTable does not propagate setTrace to the raw viewer if the trace is null. Also TmfRawEventViewer.refreshEventCount() should probably handle a null trace to set the thumb and refresh its display.Also, this clearing could be performed when executing the Delete command on a trace which is currently displayed, to allow the deletion to succeed.

37782,1,"Patch Set 1:The pack is normally closed when the last window to it is evicted from the WindowCache.This eviction occurs one of two ways:The first is by the weak LRU popping the least-recently-used window in order to release resources to keep the cache under the byte or open file limits. As these windows are popped the open window count on PackFile gets decreased, and the file is closed when the count drops to 0.The second is when WindowCache spins the ReferenceQueue. If the JVM GC killed some of our SoftReferences in order to free up heap memory WindowCache will (eventually) spin those now dead references out and decrement the open window count on the associated PackFile. When the count drops to 0, the file is closed.I just made a patch to C Git today that doesn't keep the file open if there is exactly 1 window on it. This might be useful in JGit too, but less so because the default window size is so much smaller (8 Kib in JGit). So it might not be worth my time to try and do.Are you seeing file leaking or something Chris? This code is one of the most heavily exercised areas in Gerrit Code Review servers and the current version has been running in production pretty solidly for nearly 6 months."

37909,1,"Patch Set 1:A problem with @SupressWarning is that it is too coarse.This would be the first deprecated warning to suppress and I'm not convinced it is a good idea.

I.e. we know better what is hidden.The SupressWarning annotation should perhaps refer to the use of addDerived, because anyone looking at the code with Eclipse 3.5 will not understand the problem.

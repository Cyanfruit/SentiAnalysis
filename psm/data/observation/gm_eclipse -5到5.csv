The code if (isInterrupted()) {   continue; }is broken.

How are we going to > assure that the qualifier increases (so that osgi versioning > checking works as expected)?From a p2 perspective, the qualifiers will look the same for releases and snapshots.The idea with the tycho build is that the qualifier is based on the time of the last change to occur in the bundle, taken from git. For example, compare the following two builds:https://hudson.eclipse.org/ecf/job/ecf-tycho.master-neon/6/artifact/releng/org.eclipse.ecf.releng.repository/target/repository/plugins/And:https://hudson.eclipse.org/ecf/job/ecf-tycho.master-neon/8/artifact/releng/org.eclipse.ecf.releng.repository/target/repository/plugins/You can see that qualifiers increased for the following bundles: o.e.ecf.identity, o.e.ecf.provider and o.e.ecf.provider.remoteservice.This is because changes where committed to only those bundles, therefore increasing the ""time of the last change"" for only those bundles. So if you make a change in git, the qualifier will always increase, even if the bundle's version did not.Does that answer your question?",1,834,2016/10/17 10:02,2016/10/15 9:42,2016/10/15 9:42,0,MERGED,2,4,4,7,1,1,-1,0,0

What happens when you put 2 traces from the same host taken at different times in an experiment? From what I saw, they offset a little bit but are still well apart, that's good.Also, when synchronizing an experiment, it usually creates a new trace with the timestamp transform, so the trace is ""fresh"".

The trace-synchronization mechanisms did seem like a good fit, however a lot of work would be required to that to be able to do what we want to do (make it usable with different sync algos, provide an extension point, have a UI for the user to choose which algo(s) to use, etc.) A bit outside of the scope of the bug we're trying to fix here.The approach used here has some limitations, namely that if a trace is used inside different experiments at the same time, the timestamp corrections would stack and apply for all instances of the trace. Not ideal, but that may not be an important use case (the main use case being a UST+kernel trace inside a single experiment).If you don't mind I can take over this patch, brush it up, add some test traces and tests, and we can propose it this form.

Even paying attention to copyright statements.This change certainly cuts neatly through a bunch of unnecessary and wonky code.  I was going to complain that changing the APIs in the UI classes from working with URIs to working with IResources results in a loss of generality, so that it would be more difficult to support exporting diagrams to the host filesystem (which is desperately needed, IMO) or other destinations, and that IResource is not even as appropriate a type as IContainer, but then I observed that the entire export infrastructure beneath the UI is all pinned to the IResource contract, anyways.  That, combined with the fact that any clients trying to use these UI bits would have had to construct nonsense URIs, means that I don't mind that this technically is an API-breaking change because that API was already non-functional and it will have to break again some time anyways to support exporting to non-workspace destinations.

If you do as in the legacy tooling then I can't say that it will be hard to read. There is actually an aspect that you should not make the figure larger and that is the layout of legacy models. This is especially important for ports on capsule parts which should be 11x11 pixels large, disregarding if the stacking pattern is shown or not. The reason for the proposal to keep the stacking pattern on the inside is actually more about aligning with the layout of legacy models and size of ports there, see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=496304 for initial work related to this (but that one did not include the aspect of replicated ports, since we track that separately with https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=497825 and improvements in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=500982).",2,1064,2016/10/5 14:19,2016/10/5 8:17,2016/10/5 14:00,5,MERGED,4,63,3,9,3,1,-2,-1,-1

But if you take a closer look between the screen shot for case 1 and case 2, the difference is that the ""black line"" has its ending a bit further in for case 2, i.e. the intention is to move p2 inside the package Protocols. For case 1 the intention is not to move p2 inside package Protocols but order it after, i.e. it should be a peer to the package Protocols.Anyway, since case 2 is about moving p2 inside the package Protocols, I assume that the expected result should be that p2 should be moved before p1 inside the package Protocols. As it looks now, it replaces it, at least when just looking in the model explorer with the protocol customization enabled. But the protocol message from p1Msg is now contained in p2 instead.If I disable the protocol customization, then it looks like a real mess.

It used to be that Eclipse or EGit wouldn't support this, but I think it doesn't hurt now that all of the importer wizards can find nested projects.

499,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1 Verified+1(1 comment)Hi Simon,thanks for the work! Looks good already! Just a few more thoughts on the pages below. Thanks a lot!Page Engines  * In the Configuration group for tab Match is some padding to the right and hence makes the min width larger then needed.  * The description area has a slightly different background than the rest (on my Linux box using GTK2). It has the right background in the post processor page and the item providers page.Page Filters  * I'd decrease min width a bit  * The description area has a slightly different background than the rest (on my Linux box using GTK2). It has the right background in the post processor page and the item providers page.  * The label ""Automatic behavior"" is misleading. Firstly, this label doesn't really mean a lot. Maybe something like ""Remember selected group"" would be better. Secondly, this preference is independent from the selected group/filter, still it is on the same level as the Description group, which is dependent on the selection. Maybe we should put the description and the list of filters into a group?Page Groups  * Label at the top has a larger margin to the list below than on previous pages.  * Same last two as for filtersItem Providers  * To be consistent with other pages in EMF Compare (e.g. post processors), it'd be good to have a brief label at the top. E.g.: ""Select active item providers used in the comparison editor:""",1,1324,2016/7/4 14:21,2016/6/30 14:55,2016/6/30 14:55,0,MERGED,9,134,3,4,9,3,-2,1,1

In the ticket Markus also says that there are similar issues in JDT builds. But we can add it to this commit for the platform. But it looks like in the platform this is the last remaining direct Require-Bundle entry. > Should all bundles with a Service-Component add a Require-Capability > on osgi.extender?Yes I think so. There was a contribution about this in the past, but it didn't work that time because p2 doesn't support OSGi capabilities.

It is clear that the API should reflect the services provided by the base indexer, and the IndexingLevel enum approaches this concept from the implementation side. After reading your comments, I think it would be better to use flags on the API, and the indexing level would remain specific to the NavigationHelper.

Or do we?Hmm, that's news to me. It does make some sense to offer this generic API that works with any supported matcher scope; but I think for EMF in particular, the NavigationHelper API (or a future version of it) is more user friendly.Even if we promote the IQRC to end-users in the future, that's hardly an argument to breaking compatiblity now. > Can we provide a default implementation for this feature based on > current functionality? I am not sure what to say. The ""seed"" parameter is already there for the enumerate/count/contains methods. The new functionality would just be that indexing services could be requested for specific bitvectors (which parts of the seed will be given?) as opposed to the entire input key. I believe the default implementation could just request that the whole key be indexed - it would be functionally correct, though it would not bring the performance benefits.> Can the existing behaviour work further with the new API (e.g. do we want to deprecate the old methods when we use this)?Yes and maybe.

748,"Patch Set 14:Ok, lets step back a bit here: who are the implementors and the users of the IQueryRuntimeContext API? Implementors are the Scope providers, and users backend providers? Is this correct? Rete and LS are not problematic, as they are developed in parallel with this API, so they can keep up with the API.The important question is, do we consider the chance that anyone else would implement some query backend in the future that will not be developed in VIATRA? If there won't be anyone, we should close down this API, and then the entire conversation will be moot, and we should indeed consider only the implementors of scopes.However, and I believe, this is the case, if we want to have an API for externals to provide backend implementations, the IQueryRuntimeContext API should remain compatible for both users and implementors, and appropriate steps should be taken to avoid breakage (e.g. the methods there will be in 1.4 should be stable enough). > Even if we promote the IQRC to end-users in the future, that's > hardly an argument to breaking compatiblity now.We have already broken compatibility. By adding new methods to the interface that was implemented directly by scope providers they have to be updated.

847,"Patch Set 7: Code-Review-1(8 comments)Thanks for your partial review, Laurent! While doing a review on my own and incorporating your review, I found a problem that when only the UML file is changed, the approach won't work too.I re-investigated this problem and thought about it a while... the nicest way would be to avoid loosing the information on the resources in scope during the minimization; that is, minimizing the scope but storing somewhere which resources had been in scope at the beginning. Then it would be very easy to check if a .di file was in the scope.Ideally, we could change that in the ComparisonScopeBuilder. However, e.g. the EMFModelProvider calls the IdenticalResourceMinimizer before the ComparisonScopeBuilder is even used to create the scope later down the road. Thus, there is no central point that we could change in order to retain the list of original resources in the scope.(On a side note, I stumbled across a potential source if problems: SynchronizationModel.getResources() is created lazily. If getResources() is called before the minimizer is applied to the SynchronizationModel, it'll contains the original set of resources also after the minimization. If it is called afterwards, it won't contain it. Sometimes getResources() it is called before the minimization step, such as in org.eclipse.emf.compare.ide.ui.internal.logical.EMFModelProvider.getOrComputeLogicalModel(IFile, ResourceMappingContext, IProgressMonitor), sometimes it isn't. So we cannot trust that the getResources() is minimal or not. I'll add a task for myself to open a separate BR on that.)So my best remaining idea so far: remove the comparison scope adapter introduced in this review again and instead introduce a postprocessor that checks if any .di file exists for the matched resources and if yes, mark the comparison as a PapyrusComparison.For marking the comparison as a Papyrus, the nicest way would be introducing a context field into the Comparison model. If we don't want to change the comparison model, we again could add an adapter to it in order to mark it. But that's not particularly clean :)What do you think about the above mentioned postprocessor approach?

So we can compute a minimal value > 0 that is still smaller than all the values in the series.

1363,"Patch Set 4:> Wow - this was really close. I tested this on Windows and already > typed in my +2 message. Only picking up one cup of coffee saved us > from accidentily submitting thisI still think this fix is the right thing to do, not closing resource is never a good idea but this change is defeating the RepositoryCache creator original intent, which I think was to keep stuff around as long as possible by using SoftReference.I tested this series and so far the memory consumption drastically improved because the RepositoryCache is no longer slowly growing but I can see that the disk IO increased and performance degraded in operations involving many repositories, like listing projects in Gerrit (ls-projects command).Relying on the SoftReference mechanism to evict old unused repository is not a good idea because the eviction becomes unpredictable. For example, our Gerrit master JVM heap is set to 58GB, the old generation space(Tenured Generation) is 44GB which leaves 14GB for the eden and survivor spaces. The old generation space eventually becomes full (mostly by the caches including the unbound RepositoryCache) and then the application starts slowing down because GC keeps kicking in. The SoftReference are still not being collected at that point because the buffer of available memory is not bellow the threshold that would make GC consider the SoftReference.All this to say that I will do more testing on our production server but if it turns out that the performance impact is too big, I(we) will need to consider reimplementing the RepositoryCache to achieve the goal of keeping repository in memory but without being forever (I am not sure yet what would be the eviction criteria).",4,3100,2015/9/23 14:43,2015/9/4 19:32,2015/9/18 19:27,335,MERGED,3,30,3,7,6,2,-3,-1,-1

And we need to test building with the coming milestones dependencies before it's actually released. - (minor) Using the simrel repos slow down download (index) and dependency resolution (in the case of CDT, it slows down *a lot*)So what I can do for now is have the 4.6 and staging target be the same and once Neon is out, they will start to differ.

The problem is that tab and org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote.tabs.RemoteCDSFMainTab do the same thing, but the latter for debug and the former for run. With the two different tabs for Main we end up in this situation that if you open Debug or Run launch ui, you end up with different UI on screen. I can better explain (with a screenshot if needed) when I get back to my desk.BTW if we don't deprecate RemoteCMainTab, we should not deprecate org.eclipse.cdt.launch.ui.CMainTab either. Final note, what I meant by:>  I don't think I will have time before M6/API freeze to rework this properly.is that I won't have time to refactor/review the code to be able to simply remove CMainTab and all children (including RemoteCMainTab) as that removal needs further updating the plugin.xml.

1589,"Patch Set 7:> ""allowNulls"", the design of the state system is that there should be no null values when returning from a query. It's not explicitely enforced in the backends' runtime code, but it could be. Testing this means testing cases that are not supposed to happen.When used along with a StateSystem, the query does not return null because the StateSystem first fills the interval list with a subset of the intervals and the backend fills it with the remaining subset, and both subsets complete each other and are mutually exclusive. So it is perfectly valid and expected in our runtime implementation that a backend does not fill some of the elements in the interval list. I could easily foresee test cases asserting that some elements must be null in the result of a query. These assertions could be checked after executing testDoQuery() which should therefore complete without failing.> The two ""abstract"" methods (getBackendForBuilding/getBackendForQuerying). The concept of ""reopening"" only applies to the HistoryTreeBackend, this notion should remain in that test class, not in the -Base. Parameters and the ""reopen"" constructor parameter is a nice way to offer both alternatives.Any backend could support reopening and then should override getBackendForQuerying(). Those backends that don't support it don't have to do anything. I think this is perfectly fine. My solution has the advantage to reduce code duplication. In the context of unit test code, I believe this is more important than conceptual considerations.> The abstract method I'm suggesting tells the implementation to ""create a backend and insert these intervals"". This is a clear initialization step.This clear initialization method is implemented in a final protected method that performs these steps in the base class in my patch. I think it is much better.> The pattern of an abstract method to set a protected field is used in other tests. It should be kept as consistent as possible.I hope you are not suggesting that forcing all subclasses to implement a method that can more easily be provided by the base class is preferable for reasons of consistency.I therefore respectfully disagree with your remaining objections.

Link is shown in staging view as deleted. cgit git status reports it as modified.3. Stage and commit the broken link in EGit. 4. On disk, the broken link is still there! No error logged.

Even worse, it's gone on disk! cgit git status reports it as a staged deletion, and so does EGit's staging view. If I do the hard reset instead using cgit, the link is restored fine. Looks like EGit/JGit cannot restore a valid link if the workspace contains a broken link in that place.Other case:0: Start off with a valid top-level valid link (top-level is not in workspace) pointing to a file inside a project.1.

2135,"Patch Set 4:(1 comment)Gabor, the latest patches of JDT Core and UI seem to be working quite well at a first glance. I am yet to test the feature properly. Before that, please have a look at the following as well:- It is not working for type names, e.g. when you type a substring of a class name to declare a field.- The relevance / proposal order is mixed up when fields are proposed with types. Example:public class C {	int intField;	String stringField;	{		field|	}}- In case of methods, the substring is also matched in its parameters, return type, declaring type etc. I think it should be restricted to only the method name.- Filtering of the results still seems to have some issue. Not sure if the filtered results look confusing or non-relevant due to the above issue of not restricting the match to just the name or if it is due to the non-subsequent matching. We can check that once the above issue is fixed. Also, pattern highlighting in the proposal will be very useful with this feature. Please check if it is simple to implement. Otherwise, we can do that later.",4,4800,2015/7/29 12:13,2015/7/14 13:11,2015/7/27 12:12,311,MERGED,4,62,3,5,15,3,-2,1,1

Then why was camel case also not set as suffix proposal?In a similar way, there could be some other existing type of proposal or one that could be implemented later, which may need to be handled similar to camelCaseMatch while validation.Hence, as I had suggested during code walk-through, I feel it would be better if you have the property as substringProposal instead of suffixProposal, which would be specific to your feature and will be set only for substring proposals. Then you can check for coreProposal.isSubstringProposal() in JDT/UI and call substringMatch for that, while leaving rest of the code as it is.Please check the above approach and let me know if there is any problem with that.",9,4800,2015/8/18 13:23,2015/7/14 13:11,2015/8/14 10:13,741,MERGED,1,14,4,6,15,3,-1,1,2

I suppose, the names were chosen before support for camel case matching was added. For now, I have updated Javadoc to reflect how validation is done but have not touched the method names since that change would affect subclasses as well.

We would need some small changes, 1 necessary, others optional:1) Some script languages (like JS) do not support method overloading. So you cannot @wrap multiple methods with the same name. The last one wrapped will override the first one. You either need to find different names or wrap just one of those methods and use Object as an input parameter. Using instanceOf checks you might delegate calls to your original methods (which are not wrapped in this case). Your current contribution might still work in a lot of cases, but this is by pure chance and might cease to work in a future version of Rhino.2) as your module is stateless, you might use static methods only. This will allow me to call these methods without creating an instance of the module in the future3) We create dedicated inline documentation for modules. To link to other modules/wrapped methods use @module instead of @link. eg {@module #myMethod} (without signature).4) If you like you might also move your method directly to modules.platform as it would definitely fit there.

It's the branch that always points to the latest release. The Git master branch does not have this semantic.Also my guess is that in most cases, when users want to convert their repository to Gitflow, it would make more sense to turn the existing master into develop (e.g. the EGit repository).",4,5398,2015/9/9 23:20,2015/8/28 21:44,2015/9/9 22:53,289,MERGED,10,386,3,6,6,3,-2,1,1

This means that previously there would be an error reported to the user but it would now lead to an uncaught RuntimeException.If we wanted to not wrap in RuntimeException, basically every method that does not implement an existing API would need to throw SnapshotException since implementing code may want to call another method that does.

But you are right that it could be nice for the single process case.  We could look into an enhancement to show the exited process node even after GDB dies. I suggest we do that separately.  Note that the exit code is still visible in the title of the console in that case (as long as the process exited on its own).  > * I like this additional way to restart the terminated process from > the same session :-)Me too :)  But of course, that can only work if GDB is kept alive. > * Using the setting to ""Automatically debug forked process"" and > getting a small program which sequentially creates child forked > processes, don't preserve the exit code for all children but one. > This may be related to the collision of re-used group ids.Thanks for doing that test.

There is no guarantee that Jeeeyul's (anyone's) theme will be ""light"". There will be custom dark and light themes and just resetting everytime is not a solution.

3119,"Patch Set 3:Let me explain the reset functionality. Before 4.4. if you applied a theme and afterwards another theme all stuff that was not overriden in the new theme remained styled as in the first theme. That was annoying and therefore we had this ""Restart"" warning in the Preference dialog (which you implemented).In 4.4. we introduced the ""reset to default"" functionality. If you switch from theme A to B, everything would be set to ""default"" and afterwards everything would be styled accordingly to B. This allows new themes to control everything without side effects from older themes. Please note that we still have a few bugs in the reset stuff, e.g., Form controls do not all support the reset functionality.So in your case, if I switch from one theme to ""Something else"" all styling must be resetted to the default, e.g., preferences, colors, etc. As you are now argue this reset requirement away for the OS settings in this review, we also tried to argue that away for the preferences but this was strongly requested by the JDT team.",3,6922,2015/4/17 13:56,2015/4/17 10:16,2015/4/17 10:16,0,MERGED,14,218,3,13,10,1,-3,-1,-2

I went with this structure for a couple reasons:- The functionality could be added to other platforms in the future.- The handling of VM args is completely handled in the eclipse.c, so I added this along side to make it simpler.- The eclipseCarbon.c seems to be really focused on code that interacts with OS primitives. Also in order to do the handling of VM args in this file, it would have required functions to be exported from eclipse.cFinally the changes to eclipse.c are necessary because the previous code that was handling the appendage of VM args was incorrect.

3207,"Patch Set 1:Sorry, I was on easter vacation and couldn't respond early enough.Could we please revert this change?  It dramatically reduces theperformance in case of non-bare repositories. Hey Shawn, what'sup? I have not seen such a small change with such a bad performanceimpact passing your review eyes :-)Semantically I think this change is correct. We want to avoiddealing with pathes where there are no diffs. How to achieve that?You could either apply a ANY_DIFF filter to the treewalk or comparethe tree entries manually when walking over the unfiltered trees.Previously ResolveMerger was manually comparing TreeEntriesand skipped over those where there are no diffs. Now you added the ANY_DIFF filter.ANY_DIFF sounds logical but performance wise it's not soo good.Its a very generic filter which compares content-IDs of all participatingTreeIterators. It doesn't differentiate between the differentiterators and blindly computes id's for the content unless it findsdifferent ids. If the treewalk happens to have a FileSystem basedWorkingTreeIterator included this means that you will have to readnearly every single File in the working tree and compute it's content SHA1to do the merge. ANY_DIFF has no idea that there may be a DirCacheIteratoralso in the TreeWalk which already contains the SHA1 of the non-dirtyworkingtree files. ANY_DIFF will always compute the SHA1 again. Onlyexception: if ANY_DIFF detects already a difference between e.g.OURS and THEIRS then it knows early that there is a diff and canskip calculating SHA1's for filesystem content.If we manually do the detection of diffs in an unfiltered treewalkwe can be much faster. Look at ResolveMerger.processEntry() to lookat all the cheap shortcuts we can use. E.g. if the index is dirty(somebody added something for that path) we can let the merge fail becauseof that.If OURS, THEIRS, BASE don't contain anything for that path we knowit's only index and working tree which may contain something for thefile - no need to process this path during the merge. If OURSis equal to BASE then the merge result is clear: It must be in THEIRS.All these are decisions we can take and completely ignoring whatsin the expensive working tree.Long talk - but here comes real world performance measurements showinghow this change compares performance wise to it's predecessor commit.

3222,"Patch Set 5: Verified+1 Code-Review-1(2 comments)Hi Mickael,I tested the latest patch. In general it works very well. The only thing that I think could be changed at this moment is described by the following scenario:Create 3 projects (p1, p2, p3) and 2 working sets (w1 and w2). Then assign p1 and p2 to w1; p2 and p3 to w2.Next, try to DnD p1 and p2 (together) from w1 to w2. The result is that p1 is moved to w2, but p2 is not removed from w1.In Package Explorer this operation is not allowed (i.e. moving a group of projects which contain some projects that are already in the target working set).I think that for now we should keep the same behavior in both explorers.I also took a quick look at the code. In addition to inline comments:1. Could you change the commit message to the most prevalent format?

3243,"Patch Set 1:The reason why the read-only state of resources wasn't being cached at all in the scenario of showing the context menu in the Model Explorer is because the vast majority of accesses to the read-only manager were to query the read-only state of a resource directly, not indirectly via an EObject contained in the resource.  That was the only API that was cached before:  read-only state of a model element.So, the first major change in this patch is to additionally cache the read-only state of resources in the FSReadOnlyHandler, itself.  This was easily and safely done by a minor refactoring of the AbstractReadOnlyHandler to make the cache available to subclasses.However, this was not sufficient because the cache was actually always a no-op in the context-menu scenario.  The problem here is that caching was only active during the scope of a transaction in the read-only manager's editing domain.  However, the vast majority (if not all) of the read-only queries in the context-menu scenario are done without a transaction.  And even if they were done in a transaction, each and every one probably would have had its own transaction, nullifying any cache and probably making performance a bit worse by always setting up and tearing down the cache machinery.So, the second major change in this patch is to eliminate the cache's tie to transactions.  Now, the cache is implicitly initialized when read-only state is queried and is purged in an async exec (abstracted through an injected Executor).  This fixes the read-only part of the performance problems in the context menu.A bit of work was needed to fix the read-only JUnit tests, by injecting a custom executor that the tests can use to control when the cache is purged to force re-calculation of read-only state of resources as they change state.  Note that the read-only manager's makeWritable(...) API still *synchronously* purges the cache as before, so the make-writable use cases should still work (which is born out by the tests, actually).",1,7155,2015/4/1 1:06,2015/4/1 0:31,2015/4/1 0:40,0,MERGED,9,388,3,6,1,2,-1,1,1

For instance, if a container edge is created in a rule, the source node will be removed from its place in the containment hierarchy and be added somewhere else.

However, B does not indicate this effect in the graphical syntax, which makes it difficult for the developer to understand the meaning of this rule.In a small example, the maintainability drawback might not be too drastic.

3459,"Patch Set 2:I would have thought that we have designed the framework to support events without timestamps. However, 1) there are a lot of places where it is already assumed non-null that would throw a NullPointerException, 2) even custom parsers where timestamp is optional use TmfTimestamp.ZERO if none are defined.So perhaps we can make the jump to non-null timestamps. However, I would prefer if the default was ZERO instead of BIG_BANG, because the latter creates a odd value when represented as a string.Alternatively, perhaps even better, we could create a NULL constant that overloads toString() to return an empty string (and can't be normalized/offset?).Maybe we should revive Matthew's patch that creates special classes for these timestamp constants. https://git.eclipse.org/r/24880",2,7609,2015/2/10 19:48,2015/2/6 3:02,2015/2/10 1:18,94,MERGED,28,144,3,5,5,2,-1,1,1

But considering only the existing case of the event contents, the patch allows the field filter to be specified directly on the visible 'Contents' aspect instead of exposing a generic 'Event field' aspect to the user, who doesn't have to guess that the field applies to and only to the internal event content. It is an improvement for the user experience.As for migrating the filter viewer to event aspects, that is a huge improvement as it removes the old ugly solution that used special field id strings for base event members, and required a trace event type to provide its possible fields in a dummy root event field given by the empty event type constructor. It also allows for filters on any event member that is neither a base event member or a sub-field of the event content member. Keeping the filter viewer based on event fields is not a sound alternative.I think the solution is neither crazy nor overly complex. I find it quite elegant actually.

But that doesn't mean we have to replicate all its APIs and functionalities in the TmfEventFieldAspect class. An aspect is supposed to be a singular ""quanta"" of information from an event. A TmfEventFieldAspect is supposed to represent a single field from a event. Not a way to access all the fields of an event, that's what ITmfEvent#getContent is for.That being said, I don't think it's helpful to keep arguing our little points here. It is merely a symptom of a bigger ""design clash"" underneath.

3580,"Patch Set 2:(1 comment)> ... the trace data and not its definitionYou are still thinking of ""fields"" and ""aspects"" as two different layers. They can be the same. We are not poking at bits directly here, everything is a ""definition"". It's just a matter of ""what we've implemented to put stuff in ITmfEventField's"" vs ""what we've implemented to put stuff in event aspects"".We could (and eventually should) create aspects programmatically for each field found in a CTF event. This will avoid for example having CTF fields and CTF contexts be both considered as the same thing, while they are slightly different (the context aspects can be defined per channel/trace, the field aspects per event type, etc.)> The user can create the filter without any trace being selected.What is the point of that?? And how can the user create filters with no trace opened if he has to go look for field names in another view, which will be empty because no trace is opened?We are building a graphical tool, we're supposed to make the user's life easier. Like, reading what's in the trace, and offering what can be selected. Not having to have the user read field names in another view then re-type them manually elsewhere. A prepopulated drop-down list would be much more useful than an empty text box here.Anyways, if you really feel that typing subfield names manually is such a desirable feature, I won't nak this. (One small comment though.) In a sense TmfEventFieldAspect is just a shim between the new aspect API and ITmfEventField. If we ever get rid of the latter, then TmfEventFieldAspect will be unneeded too.

3651,"Patch Set 10: Verified-1- When you add a new package, you also have to add it to the manifest. I would name the package ""nested"" not ""nesting"", since you use the term ""nested"" at all other places.- The content provider name should be 'Nested Projects' (uppercase 'p')- I think you can set the radio state by using HandlerUtil.updateRadioState(event.getCommand(), VALUE); I think there is no API to listen to content provider enablement/disablement in the Customize dialog, but you can update the radio state when the content provider is created, and when it is disposed. Enabling/disabling the content provider when the menu state changes is a little bit more tricky. You'd probably have to use code similar to what's in org.eclipse.ui.internal.navigator.filters.CommonFilterSelectionDialog.okPressed().- I take the filtering change back - let's leave it unconnected. When we disable the Java content, we also keep the Java related filters (not optimal, but that's how it currently is).- Project Presentation: it should be in the same group as Package Presentation - we can leave this as is since we don't want to introduce a dependency on JDT.- dialog store vs. preference: if you want to set it via plugin_customization.ini, then I'm OK to use a preference - but not show it in the preferences dialog.",10,7883,2015/1/12 10:21,2014/12/12 10:11,2015/1/12 8:42,742,MERGED,11,1992,2,3,17,2,-2,-1,0

This would fix Case 3 and give a good user experience.Some other issues I found during testing:- The selection gets lost when switching Projects Presentation. This is bad UI behavior and switching Top Level elements also preserves the selection.- The menu items swap:	- first time the new menu item is second	- exit and restart: the new menu item is at the top	You need to specify the order/position relative to the existing item (Top Level Elements) - afaik this is possible- Empty folders get the + (or >) sign, but clicking does nothing.

3690,"Patch Set 8:> I'm not sure why you're moving the information about disabled actionSets from the actionSets into the page hidden.

I didn't get it, sorry.> For any given window, the perspective worked with the ActionSetManager to turn on or off actionSets (it seems to do it via the IContextService). It doesn't matter what the defaults were when the perspective was created, only that the perspective remember what actionSets are active at the moment.This is still true, but ActionSetManager (and also no one else) never persisted the ""disabled"" action sets as user choice. So you could request to show/hide them (depending on the application needs), but once user decides to get rid of some action set, this decision must ""override"" application choice. The best example is the debug action sett with the global debug buttons. In the old implementation you could try to ""hide"" them - but on next restart they will come back again, or, even worse, as soon as you hit a breakpoint - and this mean they will be back in a minute. See the nice comment about it in the LaunchView (written *before* the big e4 changes), line 1442:			// When the launch view becomes visible, turn on the			// debug action set. Note that the workbench will handle the			// case where the user really doesn't want the action set			// enabled - showActionSet(String) will do nothing for an			// action set that's been manually disabled.",8,7937,2015/1/8 19:12,2014/12/21 15:32,2015/1/7 12:52,405,MERGED,3,66,4,7,14,1,-2,-1,-1

This is important because the FilteringPaletteProvider is part of the public API (per Papyrus policy of having all publicly exposed component as part of the public API). This could induce false expectations from the user, especially if a custom user-defined provider does not support the way it is proxied.Indeed, the FilteringPaletteProvider have a peculiar way of using the proxied palette provider by resetting its contributions repeatedly (on line 260). This works for the DefaultPaletteProvider because we know the inner workings of this class, but this is not guaranteed to work on all IPaletteProvider. Note that relying on the knowledge of the inner workings of DefaultPaletteProvider is not a nice pattern ...Other mprovement track: Now that WalkerPaletteContributionHelper (in FilteringPaletteProvider.java) has non-static methods and uses instance fields, we could optimize its member (private) methods so that they do not instantiate a bunch of lists for nothing but all contribute to the same.

So, the idea of the command wrapper is neat.However, the command-wrapper would be more reusable/safe if it didn't explicitly look for the Model Explorer view (maybe there are multiple instances of it!) but instead checked that the currently active view provides the IRevealSemanticElement protocol.  Also, it should account for selecting the object(s) affected by undo and redo.  In the case of redo, that's the same as execute, but in the case of undo, the affected object should be the one that the new object had been created in.Also, why select-reveal only the first result?  If multiple objects were created, I would expect all of them to be selected.

3926,"Patch Set 2:(5 comments)Undo/redo works well.  Thanks!  It looks odd, though, that undo/redo changes the selection in the Model Explorer even when focus is currently in a diagram editor.  Especially if I have ""link with editor"" turned on in the explorer because in that case, the linking of the selection doesn't actually happen (which is a good thing, but looks like a bug).  I would expect the changed selection on undo/redo to be reflected in the diagram, but it isn't.  It's only selection changes caused by mouse or keyboard in the explorer view that are propagated to the diagram.Anyways, that can all be avoided simply by having the RevealResultCommand do its thing only if its view part is currently active.  That's actually better than what I suggested last time (I suggested then that the command should operate on whatever is the current view, but that would be bad, because that view may provide IRevealSemanticElement but not be the explorer, which would be confusing at best).",2,8433,2014/11/4 18:37,2014/10/30 10:50,2014/11/4 15:49,124,MERGED,13,764,2,3,3,3,-2,1,1

I think this is the normal behavior of an editor. For example, if you create a new Java class in your IDE, the java editor won't pop-up and expect you to save the class before making any modifications to it.I think the snippet editor should not do this either.And you are right, the data-binding framework and the form editor framework are both tracking changes in the view/model. If we use only the form editor framework, we'll have to update the model by hand. (See the in-line comments)Also, I just realized that I might have made a mistake when using the data binding framework. This will update the model whenever changes occur in the editor, but we need to update it only when the save action takes place (i.e. in the commit method of the form parts). Although this is not visible as it only updates the in-memory model, not the actual json file, I think we still should avoid it. So this would be another +1 for not using the data binding framework.",8,8960,2014/8/13 11:41,2014/6/12 19:10,2014/8/13 8:54,1477,MERGED,20,743,3,14,18,1,-2,-1,-1
4182,"Patch Set 8:Hi Stefan. I don't think the analogy with the Java editor holds up. If you create a ""New > Class"", then as soon as the dialog is closed and before the editor opens, the file already exists on disk. This is *not* the case with snippets. If I use ""Add"" or ""Create Snippet"", then the editor just opened is for a snippet that does not yet exist on disk. It *only* exists in memory. In fact, the snippet editor does not even know where on disk the snippet will be saved and in what format. This is all handled by the snippet repository (in SnippetEditor.doSave):  repo.importSnippet(snippet);What importSnippet does (e.g., creating a .json file, doing a HTTP POST to a remote server, whatever) is hidden from the editor. The editor sees only the in memory snippet. See SnippetEditorInput.oldSnippet and SnippetEditorInput.snippet. The old snippet is immutable; the new snippet may overwrite this or save it under a new UUID instead.I hope this clarifies some things.",8,8960,2014/8/13 12:19,2014/6/12 19:10,2014/8/13 8:54,1477,MERGED,20,743,3,14,18,3,-2,1,1
4183,"Patch Set 8:As for the databinding framework: I don't think that values should be updated only upon a save. See m2e's POM Editor for example:- Open a pom.xml- On the ""Overview"" page change the ""Artifact Id"" (but do *not* save).- Switch to the ""pom.xml"" page. The XML already reflects your edit, even though the editor is marked dirty (*).I think this is *very* similar to our use case: We have two pages (Raw Source, Xtext-based Editor Source) whose contents should be kept synchronized, even if I don't do a save. Essentially, whenever a page is switched to, its contents need to be updated to what's in the in-memory model.Does this make sense?",8,8960,2014/8/13 12:25,2014/6/12 19:10,2014/8/13 8:54,1477,MERGED,20,743,3,14,18,2,-2,-1,0

4185,"Patch Set 8:It does make sense.I have a question here. When you said we should not use data bindings, were you referring to the source page only, or to the metadata page as well?Because in the metadata page it will be hard to keep track of all the changes, especially for list viewers (I at least have no idea how to track changes to list items without creating an observable object).Also, I don't think the two frameworks get in each others way:When a change occurs, the data binding framework will update the in-memory model (the editor does not do this by itself) and the editor is marked dirty through the change listeners on the observable objects.When the editor is saved, the on-disk file is updated, and the pages are cleared of their dirty states.So the databinding framework does not really influence the way the editor is marked dirty or not (note that we'll still need listeners to mark the editor dirty without databinding), it only helps us keep the model in sync with the view.I might be thoroughly mistaken though.

Having to rebase two changes rather than one is just more work.Regarding the data-binding framework: You may be right; they may not get in each others way. There's one concept in the FormEditor I'd like to understand first to see how things interact: staleness. What does it mean for a form part to be stale. Can this even happen? And what is our model w.r.t. which dirtiness/staleness are evaluated? The in-memory Snippet or the on-disk snippet (which may not exist initially)?

4337,"Patch Set 1:There are three groups of changes in this change-set:(a) update the Properties View implementation to reuse the same SWT controls    for its tabs when the selection changes to another single or multiple    selection presenting the same Views (according to the property-sheet model).    This is a ""compatible"" selection	(b) update the DataSource and ModelElement APIs that provide the source of    data bindings in the Properties View to allow a compatible selection to be    injected into the SWT controls already showing	(c) implementation of delegating observables that support the ModelElements'    dynamic updating of their data-binding sources	Part (a) is largely just a matter of updating the DefaultDisplayEngine to detect that the set of Views it asked to provide tab-descriptors for is the same as the set of Views for which it last provided tabs.  In this case, the existing tabs and all of their controls are re-used and the new selection is pushed into the DataSource that is currently feeding these controls.  Hopefully, the infrastructural changes in parts (b) and (c) that make this possible will allow us to further refine the re-use of controls such that any View will only be created once and can be swapped in and out of tabs using PageBooks.Part (b) updates the DataSource to support replacement of its selection.  On injection of a new selection, a notification is broadcast to announce the change and ModelElements listening to the DataSource update themselves to pick up the new selection.  This entails to fundamental changes in the way that ModelElements work:  (i) the ModelElementFactory now tells a newly created ModelElement which      factory created it, so that the ModelElement can delegate to that factory the      update for a new selection.  This is necessary because it is the factory that      knew how to unpack from the selection what the ModelElement needs when      creating the  element, so it is the best able to update the element later.  All      of the various ModelElementFactory implementations add this new capability      to update an existing element with a new selection	    (ii) when a ModelElement creates an IObservable for one of its properties, it      now wraps that observable in a new delegator pattern.  The delegator is      what ends up ultimately being bound to SWT controls.  To ensure that we      don't have to rebuild those bindings every time the selection changes      (which would entail considerable API churn to make accessible after the      fact), these observable delegators allow their delegates to be replaced at      any time (assuming that the replacement is the same kind of observable,      based on the ""compatible selection"").  Replacing the delegate fires the      usual observable change event, which updates the UI accordingly via the      bindings.	  Part (c) is the implementation of the delegating observables.  They ensure that the entire contract of the underlying observable is provided (including all custom interfaces such as ICommitListener) via the dynamic proxy class mechanism.  The usual contract of observables is implemented, including tracking the invocation of getter methods, all verified with a fairly comprehensive suite of JUnits tests.",1,9145,2014/5/26 20:04,2014/5/23 2:44,2014/5/26 19:58,89,MERGED,70,3980,2,4,6,2,-1,1,1
4339,"Patch Set 3:Patch set 3 updates the DefaultDisplayEngine to re-use SWT controls on a per-tab basis, for tabs that present the same controls for the new selection as for the previous selection.  The equivalence of the contents of a tab is determined by new equals() semantics (and accompanying hash codes, of course) for XWTSectionDescriptors and XWTTabDescriptors.  Essentially, two XWTTabDescriptors are equal (and therefore would generate the same SWT controls) if their IDs are equal and their ordered lists of section descriptors are equal.With this change, the continuity of the property sheet UI is a bit better for the user:  when changing the selection, if the new selection presents the same tab with the same widgets as the currently active tab, then that tab just shows the newly selected element.  So, for example, once the user activates the Profile tab of an element to work with applied stereotypes, that tab seamlessly updates when selecting another shape in the diagram or another element in the Model Explorer (even going back-and-forth between diagram and explorer, where selections are GEF EditParts in the one case and facet tree-elements wrapping semantic model elements in the other).  There is no flashing of the UI as controls are destroyed and re-built to look as they did before.This new patch set also fixes a problem in the delegating observables, in the case that the delegate is a delegating observable implemented as a dynamic proxy (new test cases added to cover this scenario).  This problem was uncovered in testing the customization of property-sheet models (the binding of the observable list for view constraints blew up).  The ""Customization preview"" [sic] view seems to work correctly, although I don't know what special cases there are to exercise in this view.",3,9145,2014/6/10 18:17,2014/5/23 2:44,2014/6/10 17:41,446,MERGED,74,4208,3,6,6,2,-3,-1,-1
4340,"Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1I've been playing a little bit with the selection and tab changes, and at some point the Appearance tab became completely empty. (Apparently, this happens when switching from the Diagram's ""General"" tab and a graphical element's ""Appearance"" tab. And the tab remains empty until I switch e.g. from a Class to a Property, probably because they have different contents in their appearance tab)Steps:- Create a Class diagram with classes and properties- Select the diagram and go to the General tab- Select a Class and go to the Appearance tab- Switch back to the diagram: the General tab is empty- Switch back to the class: the Appearance tab is empty- Select a Property: the Appearance tab is now populated- Select the Class: the Appearance tab is now populated- Select the Diagram: the General tab is still empty- Repeat from step 3 :)Performances are otherwise really good, when switching between similar elements. Maybe this could be extended to ""Similar Sections"" (In addition to ""Similar Tabs""): for the Appearance tab, almost all sections are the same, and this is the most heavy properties tab. Currently, if we reuse the same sections between two selections, but add a new one (or remove it), everything is redrawn (Although 80% of the contents is the same)I also have quite a lot of exceptions when switching selection, especially in the dispose() methods, when using multiple selection (I'll attach the log file to the associated bugzilla)",3,9145,2014/7/3 9:35,2014/5/23 2:44,2014/6/10 17:41,446,MERGED,74,4208,3,6,6,3,-1,1,2

4342,"Patch Set 4:Patch Set 4 fixes the two problems observed by Camille.  Firstly, and more simply, the problem of the General tab going blank.  The problem here was that the Tabbed Property Sheet would disposed of an entire tab and its contents if the new selection didn't need that tab at all, without any interaction with the XWT-based DisplayEngine.  So, the DefaultDisplayEngine would continue to try to show disposed controls for the General tab (or any other in the same situation).  Now the DefaultDisplayEngine listens for the disposal of the controls that it creates and cleans up its understanding of which reusable controls are still available for which sections in which tabs.The exceptions in multiple-selection scenarios all boiled down to observables being prematurely disposed, either by the composite MultipleObservableValue, or by a DelegatingObservable, or by a ModelElement.  So, now all of these various components that can aggregate/share observables participate in a simple reference-counting scheme so that observables will only be disposed (and will be disposed automatically) when they are no longer in use by any component.",4,9145,2014/7/4 19:11,2014/5/23 2:44,2014/7/4 18:58,1024,MERGED,83,4866,2,4,6,1,-2,-1,-1

4350,"Patch Set 3:(1 comment)I don't think there is a race condition. The sequence of events that leads to a deadlock is as follows:# thread A (the CVS client) acquires the lock# thread A does a syncExec to open the master password prompt# while the prompt is open, the main thread processes another syncExec (from Mylyn) which blocks trying to acquire the lock (either directly on the main thread or by waiting for a background job)So, when getSecurePreferences is called, we are either at step 3 above (in which case we can detect that a deadlock is about to happen), or we aren't. If we aren't, then no deadlock will occur, because either:# we acquire the lock before thread A and thread A blocks until we are done, or# thread A acquires the lock first and completes its syncExec before we go any further, or# thread A acquires the lock first, we then block trying to acquire the lock, and then thread A posts its syncExec. In this case, either we are on a background thread, so thread A doesn't interact with us at all, or we are on the main thread. According to this article [1], ""if the UI thread is blocked on an ILock#acquire(), it will still execute syncExecs from other threads that own locks,"" so there should be no deadlock in this case. I have verified that works as described; [2] shows a stack trace of the main thread processing the syncExec of thread A (in DefaultPasswordProvider) while waiting for A to release the lock[1] https://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-Concurrency/jobs-api.html[2]Thread [main] (Suspended)		owns: org.eclipse.swt.widgets.RunnableLock  (id=201)		org.eclipse.swt.internal.win32.OS.WaitMessage() line: not available [native method] [local variables unavailable]		org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display.sleep() line: 4553		org.eclipse.equinox.internal.security.ui.storage.StorageLoginDialog(org.eclipse.jface.window.Window).runEventLoop(org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Shell) line: 826		org.eclipse.equinox.internal.security.ui.storage.StorageLoginDialog(org.eclipse.jface.window.Window).open() line: 801		*org.eclipse.equinox.internal.security.ui.storage.DefaultPasswordProvider$1.run() line: 49*	org.eclipse.ui.internal.UILockListener.doPendingWork() line: 164		org.eclipse.ui.internal.UILockListener.aboutToWait(java.lang.Thread) line: 126		org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.LockManager.aboutToWait(java.lang.Thread) line: 123		org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.OrderedLock.doAcquire(org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Semaphore, long) line: 158		org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.OrderedLock.acquire(long) line: 110		*org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.OrderedLock.acquire() line: 84*		org.eclipse.equinox.internal.security.storage.SecurePreferencesRoot.getModulePassword(java.lang.String, org.eclipse.equinox.security.storage.provider.IPreferencesContainer) line: 239		org.eclipse.equinox.internal.security.storage.SecurePreferencesRoot.getPassword(java.lang.String, org.eclipse.equinox.security.storage.provider.IPreferencesContainer, boolean) line: 224		org.eclipse.equinox.internal.security.storage.SecurePreferences.put(java.lang.String, java.lang.String, boolean, org.eclipse.equinox.internal.security.storage.SecurePreferencesContainer) line: 224		org.eclipse.equinox.internal.security.storage.SecurePreferencesWrapper.put(java.lang.String, java.lang.String, boolean) line: 110		org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.commons.repositories.ui.UiSecureCredentialsStore(org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.commons.repositories.core.SecureCredentialsStore).put(java.lang.String, java.lang.String, boolean, boolean) line: 137		org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.commons.repositories.ui.UiSecureCredentialsStore(org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.commons.repositories.core.SecureCredentialsStore).put(java.lang.String, java.lang.String, boolean) line: 131		org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.core.TaskRepository.addAuthInfo(java.lang.String, java.lang.String, java.lang.String, java.lang.String) line: 266		*org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.core.TaskRepository.setCredentials(org.eclipse.mylyn.commons.net.AuthenticationType, org.eclipse.mylyn.commons.net.AuthenticationCredentials, boolean) line: 626*",3,9164,2014/8/5 20:25,2014/7/31 17:11,2014/8/1 21:54,28,MERGED,3,342,3,5,4,1,-1,0,0

4740,"Patch Set 1: (16 inline comments)Thanks for the patch.  Below are general comments, and the others are in-line.  I haven't looked in detail at all the files, because there are some relatively major changes that will cause modification to those files.I think we are quite close.  The comments may seem larger than they really are, and I believe it won't take too much effort to get this ready to commit.- I found myself writing comments that I then realized where already part of the patch I had attached to the bugzilla entry.  Can you apply ""Patch to apply after this contribution gets accepted"" to your contribution?  I know that I originally said I'd handle that part, but that was because we were trying to squeeze things into Juno; since we missed Juno, we should do this right, and have the final solution ready before it is committed.- Lets add two new methods to IGDBHardwareAndOS.java (with javadoc):   void getResourceTypes(IDMContext dmc, DataRequestMonitor<String[]> rm);   void getResources(IDMContext dmc, String type, DataRequestMonitor<String[]> rm);- Implement those two methods in GDBHardwareAndOS.java to fetch the list of available resources (-info os), and to get the actual resource information for a specified type (-info-os <type>).  Then you can use that service to fetch the data, instead of sending MI commands directly from the view.- The current implementation is specific to a Linux target with a pre-defined set of resource type.  It would be better to ask GDB what the resources are and base the possible table content on that (using 'info-os' without any parameters).  This would not only allow us to handle any new resources added to GDB, but also different targets (Windows, different Linux, etc)  As the names returned by GDB are not so great ('smh' for example), I think we can keep using the name mapping you define in ResourceClassContributionItem, however, if a resource is not defined in that class we would then use whatever name GDB has sent.  I think this solution will not only be future-proof, but will simplify the implementation.- Please make sure there are no warnings in the new code - Say the view is displaying a resource type, it has the view menu showing.  If I select the 'gdb' node in the debug view (or the launch node, or unselect everything), the view menu disappers.  That is ok.  However, when I select a valid node in the debug view, the menu does not appear again, until I press refresh.- I think having a column waaaaaay on the right hand-side will cause the user to not notice that column.  This happens for Kernel modules.  Can we re-order the colums to have the big column the last one on the right?  Or can we make thatbig column less wide?- Have we already discussed that when selecting a new resource type, the view would not refresh automatically if it is empty?  I don't remember why we would have chosenthat option.  It does not seem user-friendly.- We will need to disable the view when using a session where GDB is too old. By using the IGDBHardwareAndOS service, fixing this will be easy, by simply having the service return an empty list of resources for older GDBs.  This will require a GDBHardwareAndOS_7_5 version of the service to ask GDB for -info-os, while the previous version simply returns an empty list.",1,9709,2012/5/25 17:43,2012/5/5 8:54,2012/5/5 9:00,0,MERGED,12,1337,2,2,9,2,-2,-1,0

When I remove a column, the column stays, but when I try to add it, it adds a new duplicate one.5- If I scroll down the view and then change the debug context (but stay in the same launch) the view scrolls back to the top.  I think it would be more user-friendly to not change the view at all.  Maybe it is as simple as noticing that the context change can be ignored since the ICommandControlDMContext is the same.6- I got this NPE when switching from one launch to antoher sometimes.  I might have screwed up my launch, but it shows that it could happen:java.lang.NullPointerException    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.osview.OSResourcesView.setDebugContext(OSResourcesView.java:256)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.osview.OSResourcesView.setDebugContext(OSResourcesView.java:245)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.osview.OSResourcesView.access$4(OSResourcesView.java:214)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.osview.OSResourcesView$4.debugContextChanged(OSResourcesView.java:193)    at org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.contexts.DebugWindowContextService$1.run(DebugWindowContextService.java:212)    at org.eclipse.core.runtime.SafeRunner.run(SafeRunner.java:42)    at org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.contexts.DebugWindowContextService.notify(DebugWindowContextService.java:210)    at org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.contexts.DebugWindowContextService.notify(DebugWindowContextService.java:185)    at org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.contexts.DebugWindowContextService.debugContextChanged(DebugWindowContextService.java:408)    at org.eclipse.debug.ui.contexts.AbstractDebugContextProvider$1.run(AbstractDebugContextProvider.java:79)7- In all-stop mode, I like how the menus become grayed out when the target is not available.  However, the 'fetch' link remains usable, which will trigger a ""Fething data..."" which will only complete once the inferior is interrupted8- If there are multiple debug contexts selected,  the code choosed the first one arbitrarily.  This is not clear to the user. I suggest one of two things:  a) If all selected contexts have the same parent ICommandControlDMContext, then display resources as done now using any one context. If the parents are different, then disable and empty the view or   b) Always disable and empty the view for multi-selection9- The case where -info-os returns an error does not seem to be handled properly.  For example, if I have the OSResources view open when using a post-mortem session (core file), GDB gives:   448,664 [MI]  24-info-os   448,666 [MI]  24^error,msg=""Can not fetch data now.""   or   600,684 [MI]  25-info-os modules   600,686 [MI]  25^error,msg=""Can not fetch data now.""But the view is stuck showing ""Determining available OS resource classes..."" or ""Fetching data..."" depending on the timing.10- One time I got the following reply from GDB (maybe my gdbserver was wrong), but it caused an NPE that I think we should guard against:   915,516 [MI]  42-info-os semaphores   921,522 [MI]  ~""Ignoring packet error, continuing...\n""   921,523 [MI]  42^error,msg=""Can not fetch data now.""Exception in thread ""MI RX Thread"" java.lang.NullPointerException    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.output.MIInfoOsInfo.get(MIInfoOsInfo.java:173)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.output.MIInfoOsInfo.parseResourcesInformation(MIInfoOsInfo.java:128)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.output.MIInfoOsInfo.<init>(MIInfoOsInfo.java:75)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.commands.MIInfoOs.getResult(MIInfoOs.java:47)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.commands.MIInfoOs.getResult(MIInfoOs.java:1)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.AbstractMIControl$RxThread.processMIOutput(AbstractMIControl.java:907)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.AbstractMIControl$RxThread.run(AbstractMIControl.java:754)11- The new osresources.gif icon should go under the view16 folder and should be renamed to osresources_view.gif,    i.e., dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/icons/full/view16/osresources_view.gif    Don't forget to update the plugin.xml file to match12- In MANIFEST.MF, please export the new osview package, as the other packages are exported",7,9709,2012/9/12 18:51,2012/5/5 8:54,2012/9/12 8:43,3119,MERGED,17,1896,2,4,9,3,-2,1,1

A system property supports excluding these tests.A new ""Papyrus Core Tests (no SysML)"" launch configuration runs this test suite as it was before, excluding the SysML tests, using that new system property.The ""Papyrus SysML Tests"" launch configuration still launches the SysML tests only.All three of the launch configurations now configure the HotSpot JVM thus:  - max 768 MB of object heap.  This lets the tests run comfortably but    still ensures that if memory leaking regresses dramatically, we may    find out via OutOfMemoryError in test execution  - tune the garbage collector to more aggressively evict soft reference    caches than it would by default.  The Common Navigator Framework    retains everything ever shown in a tree via soft references, which    makes it difficult to see whether memory is leaking when observing    the tests under a profiler.

4789,"Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1Ugh.  Patch set #5 still has problems.  It has some kind of bad interaction with one or both of the UML metamodel and the GMF Notation model.  I have another test suite (for CDO integration in Papyrus) that has test failures with this patch, caused by two problems:  * ConcurrentModificationException when iterating the resources of a    resource-set and unloading them (the ECrossReferenceAdapter, as    extended by UML's CacheAdapter, seems to cause proxy resolution    that adds new resources to the resource-set while unloading    resources!)  * cross-references from the GMF notation views in a diagram to the    UML model elements that they visualize are not returned by the    ECrossReferenceAdapter::getNonNavigableInverseReferences()    API",5,9817,2014/4/29 0:08,2014/4/17 16:51,2014/4/26 12:10,211,MERGED,4,477,2,4,8,2,-3,-1,-1
4785,"Patch Set 6: Code-Review+1OK.  So, I determined that the problem with Patch Set #5 was interaction between UML2 and CDO.  The root cause was that computing cross-references ""intrinsically"" using eCrossReferences() triggered the CacheAdapter in a UML Property element, which uses the inverse cross-referencing capability to compute NamedElement::clientDependency (which used to be persistent in UML 2.4 but now isn't in UML 2.5).  This also triggered loading of objects from the CDO repository.The end result was that a Diagram in a *.notation resource, still only partially loaded from the repository (it didn't have its contained objects, yet) had the CacheAdapter attached and the CacheAdapter didn't find any contents or cross-references because the Diagram hadn't finished loading.  Later, when the Diagram's CDOLegacyAdapter got around to finishing loading, the CacheAdapter was unaware of new contained objects (Shapes in the persistedChildren containment reference) being added, because they are added without notifications (the assumption being that nothing needs to be notified because the object doesn't properly exist, yet; a reasonable assumption under normal circumstances).  Therefore, the CacheAdapter is never propagated to the rest of the contents of the diagram, so any code that needs to find diagram views of UML model elements doesn't find them, and Papyrus on CDO is basically broken.Patch Set #6 fixes this problem by reverting to the original design of the ECrossReferenceAdapter's getCrossReferences() method, which computes the cross-references ""extrinsically"".  To fix the memory leak (this bug) I override useIsSet() in the feature-iterator to basically re-implement the special case of eCrossReferences() from ENamedElementImpl.

For models that already have more highly customized cross-reference list iterators that do not extend the EContentsEList::FeatureIteratorImpl (and thus do not implement the new Filterable interface), the cross-referencer provides the same external filtering as in Patch Set 5.  This does result in derived references being computed by the underlying iterator, but it should be an exceedingly rare case.The JUnit tests are significantly overhauled, using now a generated model with some hand-written instrumentation for test assertions:  * added assertions that derived features are not computed    when the cross-referencer uses the intrinsic filtering    capability of the cross-references iterator  * added assertions that derived features *are* calculated    when the model provides a non=Filterable cross-reference    iterator  * the tests still assert proper resolving/non-resolving    behaviour of the cross-referencer, but now also for    both of the Filterable and non-Filterable iterator    casesThis new patch set does not cause any problems for Papyrus's UML modelling with CDO repositories.",7,9817,2014/5/1 16:02,2014/4/17 16:51,2014/5/1 15:50,334,MERGED,18,2222,3,5,8,1,-2,-1,-1

4872,"Patch Set 4:Thanks for giving this a look-over Daniel.  I introduced a new interface for a few reasons.First, I didn't want to filter getChildNodes() directly so as to maintain the original DOM.  The interface instead allows navigators of the DOM, such as the CSSEngine, to decide to use visibility as a shortcut.  This is useful for the CSS Spy.Second, a developer should be able to query the CSSEngine for the computed styles of an invisible widget.  I'm not sure that it's explicitly stated, but it would seem to be a reasonable expectation that if P = parent of C, then C should be a child of P.Third, I thought it might be a better pattern than cause CSSStylableElement to implement a getVisibleChildNodes(), and implement a default in ElementAdapter.  We may well have other document models that don't have a concept of visibility.I initially tried implementing this as providing an isVisible(child) method to act as a filter, but abandoned it as implementing isVisible() is particularly complicated on CTabFolder.  A CTF's children includes internal Composites and ToolBars that we can't reach programmatically, and so we can't determine their purpose.  Some of the composites exist to hold the CTabItem contents, but we can't tell which CTI.  So CTabFolderElement#getVisibleChildNodes() returns the CTabItem's control instead (perhaps it should walk and add the parents until it reaches the CTF too).  You'll also notice that getVisibleChildNodes() also returns all the CTabItem instances as they represent the tab information and they need to be exposed for tab-item properties.  Trying to shoehorn all of this into isVisible() was painful.",4,9931,2014/4/14 18:54,2014/4/10 18:19,2014/4/14 8:38,86,MERGED,8,214,4,9,5,2,-4,-1,-2

5088,Patch Set 2:(16 comments)General question: How are we distinguishing between C++11-style and legacy GCC attributes in the AST?,2,10251,2014/2/26 21:05,2014/1/30 8:46,2014/2/26 12:06,651,MERGED,39,1681,3,6,10,1,-1,0,0
5089,"Patch Set 2:(16 comments)Thanks for the valuable feedback!Regarding the distinction of C++11 attributes and GCC attributes: I left the GCC attributes as is and added the attribute specifiers for representing C++11 attributes. The distinction can be seen for example in the NodeWriter. If an I(CPP)ASTAttribute is encountered in a IASTAttributeOwner it is expected to be a GCC attribute. If an ICPPASTAttributeSpecifier is encountered there, it is expected to be a C++11 attribute. The previous implementation of attributes is a bit limiting regarding the capabilities required by C++11 attributes (scope and multiple attributes in one specifier).I also thought about a solution which introduces an attribute specifier for GCC attributes, but that would break the current API.

5128,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1Hi,thanks for contributing via Gerrit. I know about the contribution in the ticket itself, but I didn't had time to dig into this in more detail.Some things about your contribution:1. It seems you have the trailing whitespace issue. Looking at the ScrollBarHandlerTemplate there seem to be more changes marked as there are really. Could you please try to solve that so checking the changes is easier?2. This change may break backwards compatibility in case the ActiveCellEditorRegistry was used outside NatTable to perform modifications inside. Like exchanging the data or deleting a current selected value (e.g. https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=425176)Although the intention about the change is correct, I would like to keep the AbstractCellEditorRegistry for backwards compatibility. But it should be marked as deprecated, pointing to the new instance and telling about the issue when using it further. So users who will update won't get compile errors immediatelly.3. ScrollBarHandlerTemplateAlthough I'm not quite sure how to solve it better, I don't like the solution so far. The first thing is the instanceof check that seems to be not necessary. I thought you wanted to get rid of it?The second thing is that this change might not be compatible with the split viewport feature that was added lately.

So modifying ScrollBarHandlerTemplate seem to be ok.I checked where the instances are created, and they are created in ViewportLayer.doCommand() when a ClientAreaResizeCommand is handled. The ClientAreaResizeCommand needs the scrollable for size and scrollbar calculations. Typically a user should never fire that command programmatically.So you could change the API of the ScrollBarHandlerTemplate so at creation time the NatTable instance is set. You get the instance via ClientAreaResizeCommand.getScrollable().Nevertheless you should add some instanceof check, not sure on setting or on checking the editor.

And that's without talking about views.There's a few things broken as it is now:- You can't get a -1 Int value from the factory method but you can get one using incrementAttribute() on a -2 Int value- Calling incrementAttribute() on this -1 Int value skips 0 and goes to 1.- The State System Explorer view cannot display a factory-made -1 Int value (as it is nullValue), it shows a blank value.If there is any code that is using the unboxed value of nullValue to check for null, that is badly designed code because it cannot differentiate with a real Int of that same value, it should use isNull(). I believe it's better to bite the bullet and correct that code now. Hopefully all of it is fixed by the patch now.Mathematically, I think it makes more sense to use zero as the null value's numerical value.> This is also by design. If we start to allow unboxing from one type to another, people might stop caring about what the actual type is, and always unbox their things into longs for example, doing costly casts over and over.It's a point to consider, but I prefer to give the benefit of the doubt and the flexibility to the designers. In the code I'm doing now, I have to do floating point mathematical operations on a list of state values that can be a mix of Int, Long, Double or nullValue. Using unboxDouble() gives much cleaner code than having a if-else or switch statement on the value Type to figure out the correct unboxing method.The unit tests should be correct now. The LTTng kernel state system creates a Threads/-1 attribute because the first events arrive before the Current_thread attribute has any value set. I considered updating the expected test state system with these events using the Threads/0 attribute (due to the current thread nullValue's int value), but decided against it because it would still be incorrect to consider that these events occurred in the swapper (0) thread. So the nullValue current thread continues uses the -1 attribute for the 'unknown' thread.",2,10842,2013/9/13 20:17,2013/9/12 22:00,2013/9/13 19:47,21,MERGED,7,51,3,6,6,3,-2,1,1

Until here it sounds like a wrapper. But it also provide the mapping between workspace artifacts and DependencyInfos. The class has two responsibilities of that class and I would say that adding the configuration logic of the ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService would make it worse.Also I would like to mention an other point: At the moment as user of the API you can get injected a ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService or/and a ProjectCoordinateProvider as well. The ProjectCoordinateProvider access the ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService inclusive the cache logic. The ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService access the advisors directly. I think this looks a little bit confusing and inconsistent.I mentioned that because I thought about a solution to fix both:What do you think about create a wrapper for ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService which take care of the configuration AND the cache (DependencyInfo --> Pc) logic?The ProjectCoordinateProvider will still have the other cache and would use the wrapped ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService.I think we would get a better separation and could get rid of the inconsistens by using ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService without cache and ProjectCoordinateProvider with cache both.,1,10861,2013/11/22 13:02,2013/11/20 14:57,2013/11/20 14:57,0,MERGED,5,118,3,9,3,2,-3,-1,-1

Please let me know what you think about it.Currently, there is no means to trigger the export command handler. I would suggest to add this to the TmfEventsTable Pop-up menu.Here how you could call the command handler in the method createPopupMenu() of the TmfEventsTable programmatically:final IAction exportToTextAction = new Action(""ExportToText"") {            @Override            public void run() {                IWorkbenchPage activePage = PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getActiveWorkbenchWindow().getActivePage();                IHandlerService handlerService = (IHandlerService) activePage.getActiveEditor().getSite().getService(IHandlerService.class);handlerService.executeCommand(""org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.exportToText"", null);            }        };tablePopupMenu.add(exportToTextAction);-------I also would like to ask you to change the format of the text file to match the columns in the table and instead of a hard-coded order of columns (which are actually the default TMF table columns). This you can achieve using methods extractFieldItems() of TmfEventsTable and getColumns() of the TmfVirtualTable instance which is a member of TmfEventsTable. You will need some public methods to access these information and pass a reference to the TmfEventsTable instance as command parameter.",1,10972,2013/11/11 14:27,2013/10/28 9:09,2013/10/28 9:09,0,MERGED,7,322,2,3,5,3,-1,1,2

6344,"Patch Set 8:The code was adapted to work with the new Remotes API that was just merged in.  Basically the functionality is as before and is tested (except for comparing review items which I could not test due to new bug 403389).There is one part missing to resolve the File Revisions when opening a file from the Review Navigator.  Miles I will need your help for this one, see the TODO comments in OpenCompareEditorProvider#init.Right now I use the ReviewBehavior object to pass in the parent repository needed to resolve the file revision from the team repository and the resolution is done when the file is opened in the compare editor.  Ideally, we should add a reference to the repository in the ReviewItemSet model element and a team IFileRevision reference in the Mylyn Review IFileRevision.  This would enable use to decorate the IFileItem icon in the GErrit Task editor and Review Navigator at all times.

6600,"Patch Set 3:I find the framing of the tool descriptions very distracting and it isn't done elsewhere in other UI pages.  I suggest just using [] around them as you did before.The tool-tips are now actually special notes to the user and IMO should start with ""Note:"". The perf tool tip doesn't provide anything meaningful since all tools require installation.  I would prefer you say: ""Note: does not require set-up or special compilation"" which explains why we chose it as the default.Instead of ""Cache Using"" for cachegrind which is very awkward I would suggest: ""Cache Usage"" or ""Cache Reporting"".For Callgraph, say: ""Note: requires SystemTap to obtain data"" or something to that effect rather than talking about the SystemTap language.For the ones requiring compilation, I'm not sure whether to include the C/C++ qualifier or not.  They will require rewording if specifying a note: for example, gprof could be worded as:  ""Note: requires compilation of at least one C/C++ source file using ""-pg"" option."" possibly leaving out the C/C++ part which is implied by our tools (see next paragraph).This brings up an interesting issue.  Since our tools only support C/C++, should the Profiling preferences and Properties be under the C/C++ Preferences and Properties.  This should not be solved in this patch and would require a separate RFE or bug.For now, I would suggest adding something to the top Profiling page, which currently doesn't have anything on it, to indicate that the preferences are for tools using the Linux Tools profiling framework for C/C++ projects.  This will at least prevent any confusion.The Restore Defaults buttons on all the pages do not operate properly as they set the default to be the first item in any radio group.

Otherwise servers will fall over periodically when a concurrent writer races against a reader, and the reader will eventually get caught between the two path->inode translations.Go ask Sun why the felt it wasn't necessary to be able to determine the length of an open file from a FileInputStream using the fstat() system call.

However, this whole thing started out by some colleague (and me) being irritated by exactly such References. You do a Rebase, it finishes, and suddenly you have that ORIG_HEAD thing popping into your face from the HistoryView. Instead of the nice linear history you wanted to achieve by the Rebase, you suddenly have something looking very much like two branches....I think that turning the toggle into some Always/Unreferenced/Never switch would confuse the poor user too much. They would have some branch on a commit and no white label, but once the branch moves to the next commit, the white label would magically appear?So perhaps the solution to this could be to make the Additional Refs visible by default and put a button close to the ""Show All Branches"" button so that users can more easily suppress the Refs?

6997,"Patch Set 3:Ok, here's Round 2.  I think I hit all of the style issues from before, and addressed the commonBase problem we discussed.  I did it in a slightly different way than your suggestion, but I think it makes a little bit more sense given how the data comes into the generator.  Let me know if you see any problems with it.The generator should now return all commits up to the specified depth, ignoring any that were part of commonBase.  But it will correctly start returning any commits below the boundary of a previous shallow checkout, and return all commits at the old boundary as UNINTERESTING so that the PackWriter can exclude the right things from the pack.  As far as I can tell, this is correct behavior in all cases.I couldn't do the SEEN thing like I was planning on doing, because uninteresting commits get the flag set on them as well (as part of markStart()), so sometimes it's already present on commits in our queue even though we haven't added all their parents yet.  I reworked the depth stuff a bit and added some comments, hopefully making it clear enough that the depth sorting accomplishes the same thing.I'm cautiously optimistic that this is getting pretty close.

7053,Patch Set 6:I think this is the preferred layout. So let's start with this and only add options when this seems to be necessary after the new view has been used in the wild for a while. In a later step we should add another gitx-ish diff view enabling staging and unstaging of individual hunks (equivalent to git add -i). This could probably reuse the diff view implementation of Kevin's new commit viewer which has been integrated into the History View context menu yesterday. The width of the commit message pane when resizing the view should be limited to the width signaled by the vertical line showing where the automatic wrapper will start wrapping the lines and the file path panes should grab all remaining horizontal space. This way we gain maximum width for the typically lengthy file paths.,6,13038,2011/5/5 8:59,2011/5/3 22:59,2011/5/4 13:48,14,MERGED,11,869,3,7,10,1,-1,0,0

N=2560000, D=793, time/(N*D):1.49E0, time/(N*D^2):1.88E-3This tells us that Patience diff can be even faster then Myers. But even more interesting to me is the value for D (the size of the found edit-script). PatienceDiff found an 5 times lesser edits than myers. I won't say that smaller edit-scripts (with probably huger regions) are better, but my big hope is that PatienceDiff brings ""better diffs"" regarding readability by humans. We should have tests with real-world content which proof that. Tests which show better quality of the diffs as listed here: http://bramcohen.livejournal.com/73318.html",6,13292,2010/9/6 16:20,2010/9/2 21:41,2010/9/4 6:55,33,MERGED,4,751,2,6,10,4,-2,1,2
7187,"Patch Set 6: (5 inline comments)FWIW, I'm still not done speeding up PatienceDiff.  I think we can do even better than we are doing right now.  Some of the ideas may even be leveraged back into MyersDiff.  I just haven't thought about doing that yet because its still a big ugly black box to me.Coming up with D=793 on PatienceDiff when MyersDiff comes up with D=4210 is because we are only looking at unique common lines.  When PatienceDiff cannot find a unique line in a region, it just bails and does a giant replace, while MyersDiff continues to look for context.If we plugged in MyersDiff at this point as a fallback, we should get D=4210 again.  But I'm not sure that is the best immediate fallback strategy.  We could instead build a histogram of the common lines and pick the least duplicated common lines and try to find the LCS around those.  By using least duplicated we should still avoid nasty cases like ""\t}\n"" as being an anchor point for the matching, but would still be able to break out of the degenerate case.Thus far I have done only very limited testing of PatienceDiff on real-world input.  I did wire it into DiffFormatter and run `jgit log -p` to scan through the diffs.  I didn't see any obvious variations from MyersDiff, but I don't think recent JGit history is a poster child for where patience diff is supposed to produce more readable results.In case you didn't know, my motivation behind PatienceDiff was to find another solution to Gerrit issue 487 [1], infinite loop in MyersDiff.  Unfortunately patience diff really fails on single-character sequences (due to insufficient common unique points), but the algorithm is trivially simple and easy to prove that it will terminate.  I'm probably going to try and do a word-level variant of RawText and see if we can get a word-level thing to work better under PatienceDiff for the intraline difference coloring in Gerrit.Also, MyersDiff is really slow for Gerrit.  For some patches it takes 2.5s to display the page.  Of that 2.5s, 2.450s is spent in MyersDiff doing the intraline work.  Getting a faster algorithm under it would be nice.[1] http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=487",6,13292,2010/9/6 16:40,2010/9/2 21:41,2010/9/4 6:55,33,MERGED,4,751,2,6,10,2,-4,-1,-2

In file DeltaStreamTest.java I added a whole new unit test block.  PatienceDiff correctly shows what I did: -		assertTrue(Arrays.equals(data, act)); +		assertTrue(""bulk read has same content"", Arrays.equals(data, act)); + +		// Assert that smaller tiny reads have the same result too. +		// +		act = new byte[data.length]; +		in = open(); +		int read = 0; +		while (read < data.length) { +			int n = in.read(act, read, 128); +			if (n <= 0) +				break; +			read += n; +		} +		assertEquals(data.length, read); +		assertEquals(-1, in.read()); +		assertTrue(""small reads have same content"", Arrays.equals(data, act));  	}MyersDiff just shows a slop of intermixed add/deletes.

Change a file y that is in repo outside the IDE.The repo scan does not get this change, no refresh is performed.I think all external changes to resources should be refreshed or no change.GitLighweightDecorator listens to repo changes. So when refresh stuff is turned of, still changes like staged, branch change etc are shown to the user. Just the dirty information is missing and external changes are not refreshed. Reacting to external changes is provided by setting ""refresh automatically"", so this should be used for any kind of external change (you mentioned ""refresh automatically"" has a too long delay until it works).Summary: I have some doubts if it is the right way to refresh resources based on Git Repo eventing because not all external content changes in the working tree are detected.Furthermore this EGit refresh mechanism somehow does the Job of a standard mechanism (""refresh automatically"").",3,13318,2010/8/11 9:13,2010/8/10 23:15,2010/8/10 23:23,0,MERGED,8,236,2,5,9,3,-2,1,1

Since we're in incubation, it doesn't matter - but either way, it probably makes sense for this class to be in an internal package rather than part of the API, if it's a public package (which it looks like it is).",2,13405,2010/7/3 7:21,2010/7/3 0:01,2010/7/3 0:14,0,MERGED,5,15,2,2,3,2,-1,1,1

We could parameterise that to the same function and delegate based on a switch (e.g. fillInFrom(FILE), fillInFrom(STREAM) and then code if( from==FILE)fillInFromFile() else (if from = STREAM) fillInFromStream() so we only need this implementation once. Or, we could pass in a class (FillInSource) and have that delegated to.Either way, I think the duplicate looping logic should be removed so that when there's a future error, we only do it once, and it can be detected appropriately (and means we only have one place to fix in the future).",1,13474,2010/7/3 7:47,2010/7/3 1:21,2010/7/3 1:21,0,MERGED,1,110,2,2,4,1,-2,-1,-1

My opinion is, we're not freezing any APIs until we release 1.0.0.  Until then we may rip up APIs during a 0.x to 0.(x+1) release, so we should scope that way, and anyone linking to us should assume that same risk.Part of the problem I have though is the foundation encourages a 2 year commitment to supporting published APIs.

The TPD editor is one thing, because it's pretty much absolutely required to generate a correct target platform.  Not so much this shell editor.  I don't want to keep piling in more and more editors and other tools for this or that developer's preference.It's quite easy to maintain a local setup of your favourite tools and combine that with the RT setup to build your environment.  That's what I do, myself, for a variety of other Eclipse plug-ins that I use but aren't actually required for Papyrus-RT development. > The message has a summary of what I found.

7597,"Patch Set 1:I thought about this a bit more... Remember that the contents of ITmfCallsite date from the original UST-callsite implementation that ended up never being implemented. Also, it works well today because we addr2line to resolve both the source locations and the function names, but those are technically two separate pieces of information (especially since we could move the function-name-getting to something else, like parsing the binary directly, eventually).Here's another suggestion:* Remove (well, deprecate for now) getFunctionName() from ITmfCallsite* Remove the notion of ITmfCallsite from ISymbolProvider. That way ISymbolProvider is only for function/symbol names, as was meant to be initially* Add a new notion of FunctionName in the UstDebugInfo analysis, so we have a clear ""Callsite"" object for the Source Location aspect, and a function name for the Function Location aspect* Split the methods in FileOffsetMapper, where one query type will return the callsites, and another will return just the function name. Eventually the latter may stop calling addr2line altogether.That would be a much bigger change, but I think it would represent the reality better.

As far as I can tell, we'd always be updating reviews. This could explain the rather hyper-active updating we've been seeing. And yeah, we should look at the tests as they seem to be expecting one too many updates. But we need to be careful to test this change in UI as it could have significant consequences. (Note that by default, we simply returned true in all cases for model updates as that is the ""safe"" strategy -- you shouldn't be able to screw anything up by over-reporting your need for an update but you could by under-reporting it.)",2,14139,2013/10/16 16:38,2013/10/7 10:38,2013/10/15 16:56,198,ABANDONED,5,253,5,9,2,3,-1,1,2
7780,"Patch Set 2:The plot thickens a bit. Looking further at the code, it appears that what was actually happening was that the false positive was masking a failure to request an update for when reviewer changes occurred. As w/ dependencies, it seems that adding a reviewer may not actually case the modification date to be updated. So I think that isModelUpdated will need to be modified to test that the number of current reviewers matches the number of expected reviewers.At some point this becomes a bit of a performance question, because by the time we make all of the API calls to determine whether an update should occur, we may have made enough calls to actually just go ahead and update the review! So we end up making a number of calls twice. Instead we might look at always returning true here, and checking for deltas in updateModel and returning false if there aren't any. (Right now we just assume that if updateModel is called, that updates have in fact occurred.)

7846,Patch Set 1:This seem to hurt LT proxy design. I'm not certain how to handle this change too. So lets discuss some ideas.I think it should be designed as:1. Create a new interface org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.IRemoteConnection2. Provides an implementation of IRemoteConnection for local connections (org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.LocalConnection)3. Your RDTConnection goes to package org.eclipse.linuxtools.internal.rdt.proxy. It should implement the IRemoteConnection interface too.4. The method RDTConnection#getConnectionsName goes to org.eclipse.linuxtools.internal.rdt.proxy.RDTProxyManager. Perhaps it should return a list of IRemoteConnection instead of the connections name. Notice that RDTProxyManager has already a getConnection(uri) method5. Finally create a method in org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.RemoteProxyManager to return either LocalConnection or RDTConnection based upon the URI and/or IProject.Notice that org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch has already two classes about remote connection: RemoteConnection and RemoteConnectionException. They doesn't fit in current LT proxy design but I am not sure how to deal with it... :(,1,14238,2015/10/21 13:34,2015/10/20 18:20,2015/10/20 18:20,0,ABANDONED,12,292,3,4,3,1,-2,-1,-1

As the EMF implementation of the AOF represents all scalar features as IOnes, and as the IOne interface already provides a default value, it seemed useful to add an ""isDefault"" API to IOne in order to let clients know when the box's value is defaulted.

8012,"Patch Set 1:This is a new Gerrit review presenting a variation of change 38587 that fixes the problem of every regeneration of the tests producing code in a new random order, which I discussed on the Papyrus-Dev mailing list. This is accomplished primarily by a verbatim translation of the QVTo transformation steps to Xtend language.  The overall design of the transformation pipeline is the same as before:  in particular, the UML models are the same.  It's just the language in which the transformations are specified that has been changed.Xtend exposes list values in UML models in their native EList terms, which affords stable and predictable ordering of transformation operations and, hence, test model structure and generated code.  It also provides for more concise, debuggable, searchable, and performant transformations with better Java integration.  On the subject of performance:  a comparison of the QVTo version against the equivalent Xtend version, averaged over 5 runs after a couple of warm-ups with the longest run discarded finds that the Xtend version runs more than twice as fast:  49.75 seconds as compared to 117.25 seconds.  This is including the M2T code-generation step that is the same Xtend in both cases and XMI identifier generation which is unique to the Xtend implementation of the UML transformations.  But, to me this is a bonus, not the important factor:  it's the tooling support and stability of the transformation that are most significant.A new UMLWriter workflow component is employed to assign predictable, stable XMI identifiers to elements of generated UML models to avoid unnecessary diffs in source control when re-generating.  (somewhat moot now that the models are no longer in git)This patch set also regenerates the test code from the Xtend version of the framework. I have git-ignored the generated UTP source models because they reference and depend on UML instance models of the GMFGens that are already git-ignored, so there's no point in having these in git.  Besides that they are now much larger because of the generated unique XMI IDs.I welcome any feed-back you may have on the question of whether we should adopt this Xtend-based transformation or continue with the QVTo implementation.  I do want to continue adding more synchronization test cases to complete the coverage of that new capability, so it would be nice to do that only in one or the other variant of the test framework.  ;-)",1,14589,2015/4/14 21:21,2014/12/10 13:52,2015/4/14 21:13,3007,ABANDONED,524,186169,2,5,6,2,-2,-1,0
8013,"Patch Set 1:Also, I think it's worth noting that the (rather trivial, actually) exercise of translating from QVTo to Xtend picked up some problems that the QVTo language makes it easy to miss.  For example:* strings concatenated accidentally that were supposed to be separated in a list by commas (in the lists of edit-parts to test)* some GMFGen models have one or more GenNodes that don't have a model facet, resulting in stuff silently not happening in QVTo but more noisy with Xtend (requiring action to adapt the transformation logic)",1,14589,2015/4/14 21:24,2014/12/10 13:52,2015/4/14 21:13,3007,ABANDONED,524,186169,2,5,6,2,-2,-1,0

8215,"Patch Set 7:I think we should try to move the execution of the hook into a hook class in order to not pollute the jgit commands with this code.Instead of calling FS.DETECTED.findHook(repo, Hook.COMMIT_MSG) returning thefile containing the hook script we could ask a factory class to construct an instanceof a corresponding commit message hook class. The factory class would checkif a matching hook script can be found, if not it would simply return null to signalthere's no hook installed. If a matching hook script is found the factory returnsan instance of the hook class.The code needed to execute the hook script could be encapsulated in the hook classand the JGit commands don't need to know that the hook implementation is a script.So instead of if (!noVerify && FS.DETECTED.findHook(repo, Hook.COMMIT_MSG) != null) { .... lengthy execution code polluting jgit commands ... }we could write something like if (!noVerify) {        CommitMessageHook hook = factory.findCommitMessageHook(repo);        if (hook != null) {               hook.execute(parameters needed for execution);        } }Visibility of the Hook enum can then probably be reduced to package visibility.if we go for this approach we should also change the implementation of pre-commit hook accordingly",7,14759,2015/2/18 21:23,2014/10/31 14:30,2015/2/17 13:52,2615,ABANDONED,5,151,4,6,11,1,-1,0,0

If this was done to give dirty editors chance to save their content - this doesn't work either, because first of all user denied once that he won't save it and second because the editor immediately recognize that resource is gone and simply stops to render the content and shows ""file does not exist"" error.The good news: with https://git.eclipse.org/r/41675 patch dirty editors of closed project will be closed too.Not so good news: this works only for projects closed with the ""standard"" CloseResourceAction - all other ""closing"" possibilities (custom actions or direct API use) will still not close the editor.So I think this change still makes sense.",3,14765,2015/2/12 19:27,2015/2/10 21:46,2015/2/11 5:54,8,ABANDONED,1,7,4,8,3,3,-2,1,1

This makes it very difficult to review the change.Can we take this a step at a time, starting by just factoring out the specific releng changes needed for integration of MWE2 and Xtend into the build for this plug-in?

Why not in this case?  Or are we free now to introduce more POM hierarchy for other purposes?  That would be fine with me; I just thought that was not currently policy.  Also, I'm concerned that we're adding POM files that aren't maintained within the Eclipse projects and are therefore not easily managed within the Eclipse environment (they are only accessible in the Git directories).  For example, there isn't a plugins/infra/gmfdiag/css/xtext/.project file to create an Eclipse project that makes the pom.xml accessible within Eclipse.Any comment on the site.xml and xdoc files that look like auto-generated stubs?  AFAIK, we don't use these in Papyrus.  And all of the files that are changed in plug-ins that aren't generated?What I was hoping to see was common infrastructure that I could re-use in my own Xtend projects to simplify their build configuration (which, granted, isn't exactly complex:  the xtend-maven-plugin is quite simple).

There's just the pattern established when Tycho was first implemented in Papyrus and some discussions on the mailing list and conference calls that I remember (or perhaps misremember).  Anyways, I certainly don't object to changing the module structure if it can help improve matters, but it would be nice to see any changes implemented consistently throughout the repository.> Indeed all pom.xml are currently on the same level as a .project file, but I> believe that we should change that.> - you can change the pom.xml with eclipse directly in the git repository view.Yes, that's a good point.

These POMs need to be better modularized, and not just because of the number of times I've had to manually merge them because they're a central locus of change!  The same can be said for the JUnit AllTests suite (I've actually implemented something on my branch to help modularize that one).> *****On a more practical view, this is what I suggest : *******> - create independent bugs for each generation typeAgreed.> - create a bug for publishing good website from each plugins with maven/tychoI'll be interested to see what the enhancement bugzilla says about the motivation for this.> - create a bug for the structure of pom.xmlAgreed.> - push gerrit contribution to MASTER that will be reviewed by everyoneAgreed.> (especially you :))Yes, I can volunteer. :-)> - treat the subjects in this order : xtend, emf, site, mw2Why would mwe2 not be a higher priority than the site?

And doesn't that complicate the whole thing uselessly? Is it just to cache to full range data because we suppose it may be used more than once, while each zoom range is pretty much unique?There are two reasons for the two lists. One is that when you zoom out completely (a common case) the list is already available. The other is that when you scroll and zoom out you have 'some' level of detail before you settle on a new window range and the new zoomed list is computed. Otherwise everything outside of the old window range would be completely blank, and you would be scrolling 'in the dark' (e.g. when you drag the scroll bar thumb).I can see two cases where you only need one list. First is if you know that your data is small enough, you can have only the full list computed without any resolution gaps, then you don't need any zoomed list. The second is if you want to have only the current window visible data, then you can avoid the full range list -- with the caveat explained above (note that in this case, setting the zoom range to null when zooming to full range would be a bad idea...).",2,14909,2014/11/12 22:25,2014/11/10 15:51,2014/11/11 21:36,29,ABANDONED,1,86,4,9,2,2,-3,-1,-1

8360,"Patch Set 1:Daniel,the underlying problem is that notifications occur before the initialization of the variables ÔÇ£artifactReposForRemovalÔÇØ and ÔÇ£metadataReposForRemovalÔÇØ has been completed. It is a timing issue as far as I can say, as the NPEÔÇÖs does not happen all the time. And if the NPEÔÇÖs occur, everything is installed/uninstalled just fine, except that the users get a little bit worried as there are exceptions in the install log.If you look at DirectorApplication#run (line 1080 and following), ÔÇ£initializeServices()ÔÇØ is called at line 1088 which does register the provisioning event bus listener at the end of that method. At this point of time, ÔÇ£initializeRepositories()ÔÇØ (called at line 1095) hasnÔÇÖt been called yet and therefore both variables are still null. If there is an incoming notification before ÔÇ£initializeRepositories()ÔÇØ is fully processed, you run in the NPE. Once ÔÇ£initializeRepositories()ÔÇØ is called, the notifications are processed without triggering an NPE.The proposed fix is the simplest approach without changing the original control flow of the DirectorApplication. Obviously it would be also possible to do the registration of the provisioning event bus listener after the call to ÔÇ£initializeRepositories()ÔÇØ, but this will modify the control flow of the DirectorApplication slightly. IÔÇÖm open for any suggestion and can also provide a patch that moves the provisioning event bus registration after ÔÇ£initializeRepositories()ÔÇØ.",1,14946,2014/9/17 6:30,2014/9/1 7:58,2014/9/1 7:59,0,ABANDONED,1,5,3,17,2,2,-4,-1,-2

However you could replace these tests cases with an extension of these test cases or a customized version based on this open source bundle.So when running your builds you want to know if the original  tests.dsf.gdb still compiles as you need to re-base you custom test cases at a later point. So you would add this open source module to your build.However you don't want to run the open source test cases as they would fail in the custom environment but you still want to execute the extended version so you don't want to skip al tests either.So the option is to simple skip the test cases for the tests.dsf.gdb bundle and leave it on for other tests bundles.

They are thrown away by the ViewRegistry, but shouldn't be.  This is a blocker, IMHO.  * I don't much like the category story, especially with how the ""general"" category is pulled out. But this is forced due to how our current model is built, where an MPartDescriptor's category is not the actual category id and the category is actually encoded as a tag (and hence not localizable?).  ViewRegistry should be fixed, but that doesn't have to be done as part of this work.  I'd at least like this category-finding code pulled out with a comment.  I wonder if we could use the MCategory for this purpose too.  * Change CapabilityFilter to know how to build an activity-style IIdentifier for model elements.

8485,"Patch Set 1:A further change in how Model Explorer manages refresh, to avoid recalculating the entire tree structure on every model edit, which doesn't scale well on large models.First, the Model Explorer's resource-set listener now only schedules structural refreshes for the specific objects that notified changes.Second, the UMLLabelProvider fires LabelProviderChangedEvents to trigger label updates for elements that derive their labels from other related elements, when those related elements are changed.  This required a new mix-in interface for label providers in the Label Provider Service to allow Model Explorer and other clients to pass notifications to them on changes in the model.  I'm not entirely happy with this solution, but it does address a couple of issues with the approach I would rather have taken, which is having individual label providers listen for model changes themselves:  * the providers registered with the Label Provider Service aren't initialized with a    ResourceSet, ServicesRegistry, or other context in which they can find the    model to listen to  * providers could discover, as they are asked to provide labels, the objects they    need to listen to.  But should they be Adapters or ResourceSetListeners?  And    can we be sure that they won't leak, that the providers will be disposed at the    right time so that they can remove listeners/adapters?  * only the Model Explorer (for now) needs label providers to trigger updates.    Element-picker dialogs and other widgets in the Properties view, for example,    don't have this need, so this design ensures that the large number of other    UMLLabelProviders that are created (there are lots) don't all listen for model    changes    I am willing to explore this alternative further if reviewers agree that the new IDependentLabelProvider interface isn't a great thing.Another point that I'm not sure about is the changes in the SemanticUMLContentProvider to prevent addition/removal of stereotype applications from a resource triggering complete refresh of the Model Explorer.  I don't know in what contexts this might break some UI that depends on that refresh trigger.  The consequence of reverting the SemanticUMLContentProvider changes is only that applying/unapplying stereotypes results in a long lag in the UI on large models as the Model Explorer refreshes itself.

However, the current RMF target platform includes version 4.8.2 (which is part of the Eclipse JDT v.3.7.2). Plese note: Our current build is still based on eclipse 3.7 (indigo). Nevertheless, the orbit update site includes junit 4.10, which could be used as well.@ Fran├ºois: Do you use the RMF indigo target development definition?(2) Our plan is to build RMF 0.9.0 on top of Kepler. The Kepler update site includes a newer version of JDT as well as a newer version of Junit.(3) I guess, that the JUnitBenchmark library is not part of the Eclipse Orbit Project.

I think UserMenu.js needs to keep calling getAuthForm(url) to provide the redirect, but maybe `url` should always be the location of index.html, which would prevent any  user-specific information in the page URL from being preserved across logins.

Wim, no my extension point can not be used like this, as he adds a tab the the overall edtitor, while the vertical extention point adds it to the single elements in the tree.(+) I think it is very interesting, and provides means to solve a few problems. I also like the possiblity to have a list instead of the tree.(-)It breaks with the consistent Eclipse usage one is used to. That is, e.g. the feature to mark duplicate ids should be embedded more Eclipse style s.t. it integrates into the problems view etc. I like the feature to jump to the entries in the tree and the source, again, this should be solved the eclipse way. Repair and Mark should be applicable to the tree.The argument requirement org.eclipse.e4.tools.modeleditor.utilitytab.enabled is a no go.I like the patch, I don't like that it breaks with the way one is used to use Eclipse and I think the functionality embedded should be integrated in other ways.

8606,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1(1 comment)I would prefer if we removed completely the concept of bookmarks file from the interfaces and instead use the editor's input. The file in the FileEditorInput is always the file used for storing bookmarks.How about a solution where the TmfTraceManager has a static method to return the editor associated with an opened trace? Then you can easily get the file from the editor input. Or the TmfTraceManager could return the file directly.Note that if you are using the TimeChartView, you can already get the bookmarks file from the TimeChartDecorationProvider associated with the trace. It is stored when the trace is opened from the signal's getBookmarksFile(), or when the view is opened from the editor's getBookmarksFile(). But both of these methods could be removed if we use the editor input or the new suggested method from TmfTraceManager instead.",1,15263,2014/4/1 13:05,2014/3/31 15:28,2014/3/31 15:28,0,ABANDONED,3,28,4,8,1,1,-2,-1,-1

We could build a command infrastructure, but that's what EMF edit is for. But it's too ambitious to put in edit support yet.2.

8986,"Patch Set 1:The pack is normally closed when the last window to it is evicted from the WindowCache.This eviction occurs one of two ways:The first is by the weak LRU popping the least-recently-used window in order to release resources to keep the cache under the byte or open file limits. As these windows are popped the open window count on PackFile gets decreased, and the file is closed when the count drops to 0.The second is when WindowCache spins the ReferenceQueue. If the JVM GC killed some of our SoftReferences in order to free up heap memory WindowCache will (eventually) spin those now dead references out and decrement the open window count on the associated PackFile. When the count drops to 0, the file is closed.I just made a patch to C Git today that doesn't keep the file open if there is exactly 1 window on it. This might be useful in JGit too, but less so because the default window size is so much smaller (8 Kib in JGit).

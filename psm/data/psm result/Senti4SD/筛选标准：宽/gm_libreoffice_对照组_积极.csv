3004,"Patch Set 5: Code-Review-2(1 comment)I advise against hardcoding specific services. Especially when they are only available in a small subset of languages.Letting special cases creep in like the one in flagged in the comment is even worse.Instead of hardcoding the ask site, make it a generic ""find help online"" or similar, that links to the domain specifically created for those kind of links: http://hub.libreoffice.org/something.That in turn can then redirect to language specific resources. (either redirect directly to askbot or show a overview page, depending on language. That then can be maintained/updated independently from LO (you cannot change the hardcoded URLs in a released version of LO after all)so again:* make it a generic page instead (not ""Questions and Answers"" but something like ""Get help online"" or something similar)* all URLs in LibreOffice itself should be http://hub.libreoffice.org/something ones.definite -2 because of the special handling of locales, without it it would still be a fat -1 from me",5,2702,2016-07-07 22:57:48,2016-07-08 23:10:12,24,MERGED,25.0,72.0,3,6,10,positive

I tried that. And can give it another try. But it would require a much bigger change, obviously. The main problem is that wingdi.h is actually included from other windows headers too. So we can't fully control when it's included. But can give it another shot and narrow it down further. In fact, I spent hours trying to find what file includes the conflicting values to create this patch. > The current fix allows workdir/CustomTarget/officecfg/registry/officecfg/Office/Common.hxx > to be included, but if a source file happens to first include that > officecfg/Office/Common.hxx, then include wingdi.h, and later wants > to acutally use the struct RGB from Common.hxx, it still runs into > a problem.Well, that would be be a problem _only_ if wingdi.h was already included _before_ Office/Common.h, and in that case the build would fail because the macro would conflict with the declaration of RGB (my patch avoids this situation).However, if wingdi.h was _not_ included at the point of #undef RGB, then nothing bad would happen if it is included afterwards. Unless I missed something, I don't see how there would still be a problem, as wingdi.h will define RGB without issue.I should add that I hated this particular line of my patch. I share your view that it's best avoided altogether. But I couldn't find a better solution. Will try again though.",4,9501,2015-11-11 01:47:58,2015-11-12 10:55:41,33,MERGED,21.0,483.0,2,7,4,positive

Another one is that, because we are adding a new attribute that's not yet in the ODF standard, we need to use a different namespace other than 'table:', to make sure that when we export the document it will be a valid ODF.

18906,"Patch Set 3:When designing the framework, we had two basic ideas:- interesting document models are easier to be loaded from some format, than building them from code- checking an in-memory document model is reasonably easy (usually by using the UNO API), at least easier than asserting a written file (think of manually checking a binary .doc result)That's why for export tests, we do an import->export->import sequence. That ensures that the doc. models can be still stored in a file, allows asserting the result using the UNO API, and still export problems are detected. (I'm just re-stating what's in sw/qa/extras/README, just in case for some reason that file is not clear.) Hopefully this makes it clear how export tests are done. :-)Regarding loosing data during import/export: sure, sometimes that's necessary when e.g. our numbering types and MSO's numbering types do not match. In your case, the provided tests passed just fine when also the exporter got included in the chain, that's why I changed that. As long as it passes, it's safe to change, and it ensures that your export improvements won't break in the future silently. ;-)",3,15875,2014-11-08 15:45:16,2014-11-09 21:42:20,29,MERGED,10.0,104.0,3,6,3,positive

PNG compression; if we want to thread it, then let's thread just the compression - that'll make it local, more maintainable, and we can go with as many threads there as we wish (for just the PNG compression piece of code).Wrt. the 342125b8ea - thanks for that!

36277,"Patch Set 1:Hi Kendy,Please look into this and tell me if it is the right way to proceed.This throws the Unknown Property Exception as indicated below.I think we may need to call this setPropertyValue() <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/editeng/source/uno/unofield.cxx#675> instead of the one currently being called <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sw/source/core/unocore/unofield.cxx#2152> which is throwing up an Unknown Property Exception at <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sw/source/core/unocore/unofield.cxx#2165> One is sw's implementation while the other is editeng's implementation. Moggi was of the opinion that the setPropertyValue() from editeng couldn't be called here. But the current one is unable to support that property (UNO_TC_PROP_TEXTFIELD_TYPE). How would it be possible to proceed?I'm influenced by this comment <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/offapi/com/sun/star/text/textfield/Type.idl#19> when I say the above.Also, I did a '#define UNO_NAME_TEXT_FIELD_TYPE ""TextFieldType""' in <opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sw/inc/unoprnms.hxx> taking other properties from here <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/include/editeng/unonames.hxx> as an example. But I'm unsure if this is the right way to proceed.Since I've mentioned '[optional, property]long TextFieldType;' as optional in <opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/offapi/com/sun/star/text/textfield/ExtendedUser.idl>, I might need a boolean to indicate when 'setPropertyValue()' must be called for each of the fields from <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/offapi/com/sun/star/text/textfield/Type.idl> in here <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/xmloff/source/text/txtfldi.cxx#706>. I don't think we need to call it for all 15 properties all the time. How do I use the boolean variable - like for example - how do I use it to indicate when to set EXTENDED_TIME and when not to..?Regarding the comment thread on the bug page - you'd asked what happens when I run it without removing certain stuff from content.xml . The exact same exceptions are thrown in the order of Comment 13 first and then Comment 14.On a side note, I would like to say that I'm doing this coz you'd asked me to work on LO code (with respect to GSoC) and this was a bug reported by you. Since you didn't remember filing this bug, if there is something else that you'd want me to work on, please do tell.I would have loved to work on creating MAR files (from onlineupdate module), and still do think that's the best thing to do as it would mean I would get a headstart when it comes to the actual coding period begin dates, and had sent a mail to you regarding that.

What should I do in this situation?**************HiThanks a lot for the picture.I just had a discussion with a couple of other people. Please start working at the bug you asked about (45904), but there are a couple of BIG BUTs:- please save all the calc (sc) to last- please make your commit message ""converted java test to python""- do NOT refer to the bug in the commit.Background for this, is that we have one person who feels strongly about C++, while the rest of us just want it converted....Your work is really apriciated, and fact is that it will not be done for C++.Looking forward to blog about your camp, keep up the motivation. Please tell the others, that we are all proud of your work.There is at the moment an efford ongoing to organize a formal hackathon (hackfest) in turkey. I will follow up on that in the weeks to come.Keep hacking and having fun.rgdsjan i.****************",1,25848,2016-02-01 14:55:47,2016-02-01 14:55:47,0,ABANDONED,2.0,27.0,5,11,1,positive

I checked xml difference between => RT file on master & RT file on my patch. I have one observation here : the sequence of writing the text and the table is not changed. Kindly have a look at the screen shot : http://wikisend.com/download/593286/XML_Diff.png . To my understanding there is no technical difference in the xml, though there is a visual disparity. This doesn't seem to be caused by this fix. I had a suggestion, if we can deal the issue for corruption in this patch and the visual disparity issue dedicatedly. Thanks a lot to share your opinion on the same :)<vmiklos> Rajashri: if you want to do that in a separate commit, fine. but then please comment on https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/#/c/9914/ what is the URL of the second change, so they can be merged together. obviously if a review is requrested, the last thing we want is to approve it when it is known that it introduces a regression.<Rajashri> vmiklos : ok.

311,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2 Verified+1Thanks for the contribution, Fred!  Even paying attention to copyright statements.This change certainly cuts neatly through a bunch of unnecessary and wonky code.  I was going to complain that changing the APIs in the UI classes from working with URIs to working with IResources results in a loss of generality, so that it would be more difficult to support exporting diagrams to the host filesystem (which is desperately needed, IMO) or other destinations, and that IResource is not even as appropriate a type as IContainer, but then I observed that the entire export infrastructure beneath the UI is all pinned to the IResource contract, anyways.  That, combined with the fact that any clients trying to use these UI bits would have had to construct nonsense URIs, means that I don't mind that this technically is an API-breaking change because that API was already non-functional and it will have to break again some time anyways to support exporting to non-workspace destinations.  Besides that none of these UI classes should ever have been exposed as API to begin with.All of which is to say thanks for working through the contribution process and do come back for more.",1,970,2016-10-13 21:08:40,2016-10-13 21:08:40,0,MERGED,5.0,118.0,4,5,1,1

480,"Patch Set 2:(3 comments)I concur with Ernesto.  If the TP generation works for him on Mac, it will work on all platforms.  The Xtext editor fully supports, via EMF, the platform:/resource URIs.The nesting project structure of the releng directory tree is confusing.  Are we supposed to import only the top-level releng/ folder into the workspace as a project, or the individual nested folders within it?  The actual formulation of these include URIs depends in any case (whether relative or absolute platform:/resource URIs) on how the projects are imported.  I would be much happier if we could just eliminate the confusion by not using nested projects at all so that everybody imports the projects in the same way and the include references work for everybody.",2,1186,2016-09-21 18:02:01,2016-09-21 19:48:33,1,MERGED,6.0,27.0,4,17,3,0

It has the right background in the post processor page and the item providers page.  * The label ""Automatic behavior"" is misleading. Firstly, this label doesn't really mean a lot. Maybe something like ""Remember selected group"" would be better. Secondly, this preference is independent from the selected group/filter, still it is on the same level as the Description group, which is dependent on the selection. Maybe we should put the description and the list of filters into a group?Page Groups  * Label at the top has a larger margin to the list below than on previous pages.  * Same last two as for filtersItem Providers  * To be consistent with other pages in EMF Compare (e.g. post processors), it'd be good to have a brief label at the top.

675,"Patch Set 2:Sorry, I totally missed your response somehow. > The commit message is missing the bug title.Well the rest of the ticket description is far too long to match the rules, that is why I didn't add it. I can add it but then the warning will arise that the first line of the commit message is too long. :) > Should we change the reference to org.eclipse.equinox.event in > org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.addons.swt.test too?IMHO yes, and everywhere it was added just to satisfy the test-runtime. In the ticket Markus also says that there are similar issues in JDT builds. But we can add it to this commit for the platform. But it looks like in the platform this is the last remaining direct Require-Bundle entry. > Should all bundles with a Service-Component add a Require-Capability > on osgi.extender?Yes I think so. There was a contribution about this in the past, but it didn't work that time because p2 doesn't support OSGi capabilities. But we could add Require-Capability and the p2.inf files to all bundles that make use of DS.I will update the contribution on this later and see if the build and the feedback is fine then.",2,1465,2016-08-28 20:52:34,2016-08-29 11:17:06,14,MERGED,4.0,20.0,3,5,4,0

1089,"Patch Set 7: Code-Review-1(8 comments)Thanks for your partial review, Laurent! While doing a review on my own and incorporating your review, I found a problem that when only the UML file is changed, the approach won't work too.I re-investigated this problem and thought about it a while... the nicest way would be to avoid loosing the information on the resources in scope during the minimization; that is, minimizing the scope but storing somewhere which resources had been in scope at the beginning. Then it would be very easy to check if a .di file was in the scope.Ideally, we could change that in the ComparisonScopeBuilder. However, e.g. the EMFModelProvider calls the IdenticalResourceMinimizer before the ComparisonScopeBuilder is even used to create the scope later down the road. Thus, there is no central point that we could change in order to retain the list of original resources in the scope.(On a side note, I stumbled across a potential source if problems: SynchronizationModel.getResources() is created lazily. If getResources() is called before the minimizer is applied to the SynchronizationModel, it'll contains the original set of resources also after the minimization. If it is called afterwards, it won't contain it. Sometimes getResources() it is called before the minimization step, such as in org.eclipse.emf.compare.ide.ui.internal.logical.EMFModelProvider.getOrComputeLogicalModel(IFile, ResourceMappingContext, IProgressMonitor), sometimes it isn't. So we cannot trust that the getResources() is minimal or not. I'll add a task for myself to open a separate BR on that.)So my best remaining idea so far: remove the comparison scope adapter introduced in this review again and instead introduce a postprocessor that checks if any .di file exists for the matched resources and if yes, mark the comparison as a PapyrusComparison.For marking the comparison as a Papyrus, the nicest way would be introducing a context field into the Comparison model. If we don't want to change the comparison model, we again could add an adapter to it in order to mark it. But that's not particularly clean :)What do you think about the above mentioned postprocessor approach? It is not super-efficient, as we theoretically had the information already that we obtain again in the postprocessor. But at least we only do it once for each comparison instead of checking it again and again in the different UI components.",7,2028,2016-03-02 14:57:27,2016-04-27 16:22:49,1345,MERGED,36.0,3498.0,4,7,28,0

1573,"Patch Set 2:> What about instead having two separate wrapper classes, a reader and a writer one?Do we want this wrapper to be used only for custom state value or would it be useful anywhere else? If only for custom state values, then a reader and a writer makes sense. The flipping can turn one into the other.> Can this be internal, that way we can make this into an eierlegende wollmilchsau progressively as need be?That means keeping the custom state values internal and x-friending anyone who needs it. That's good for Neon, but I'd put it public as soon as the O branch is available.Anyway, the IO analysis will not use custom state value for Neon.

1696,"Patch Set 13:> OK, so what was presented at the meeting had ""Views"" first. So I better understand why Bernd is now surprised that Views comes last in the list.> So I guess keeping lexicographical order was not discussed at that meeting then, perhaps this aspect was overlooked.1- Gerrit please don't reformat this!2- It was discussed, and the thought was it should be like photoshop/code block/qt creator/audacity/eclipse's plugins menu: external stuff below the built-in. We actually wondered if out of alphabetical order was going to make the users experience off and concluded that changing the convention set up by many other applications would be far worse.3- Notice the question mark next to views? that was there in the wiki, we didn't come to a conclusion on that point. It was more of a ""We can't think of anything better, let's put this here then update it"" item.4- The main conclusion (according to my memory) was the #2 was the proposal to take. We moved on to other topics after, we did not spend 3 hours on this one point.I think the amount of responses though is good, it shows that we all care about the users getting the best trace analysis experience possible. Tomorrow we shall discuss this and come to a reasonable understanding, I am certainAlso, memory is malleable, I think we need to take better minutes for all that is user facing.

It's only at 3 now, but others could be added in the future.* Changing the name to continue respecting alphabetical ordering may work now, but again, new elements may be added, like ""Aweseome stuff"", and will end up sorted first.* Internationalization may change the names completely.I'm open to do some tweaks, but we have to be very careful with this, and be sure that ""putting Views first"" is more important than all the points above.",13,2818,2016-02-23 02:00:19,2016-04-27 21:57:48,1555,MERGED,10.0,365.0,8,15,13,0

1913,"Patch Set 4:> Wow - this was really close. I tested this on Windows and already > typed in my +2 message. Only picking up one cup of coffee saved us > from accidentily submitting thisI still think this fix is the right thing to do, not closing resource is never a good idea but this change is defeating the RepositoryCache creator original intent, which I think was to keep stuff around as long as possible by using SoftReference.I tested this series and so far the memory consumption drastically improved because the RepositoryCache is no longer slowly growing but I can see that the disk IO increased and performance degraded in operations involving many repositories, like listing projects in Gerrit (ls-projects command).Relying on the SoftReference mechanism to evict old unused repository is not a good idea because the eviction becomes unpredictable. For example, our Gerrit master JVM heap is set to 58GB, the old generation space(Tenured Generation) is 44GB which leaves 14GB for the eden and survivor spaces. The old generation space eventually becomes full (mostly by the caches including the unbound RepositoryCache) and then the application starts slowing down because GC keeps kicking in. The SoftReference are still not being collected at that point because the buffer of available memory is not bellow the threshold that would make GC consider the SoftReference.All this to say that I will do more testing on our production server but if it turns out that the performance impact is too big, I(we) will need to consider reimplementing the RepositoryCache to achieve the goal of keeping repository in memory but without being forever (I am not sure yet what would be the eviction criteria).",4,3100,2015-09-04 19:32:28,2015-09-18 19:27:35,335,MERGED,3.0,30.0,3,7,6,1

1920,Patch Set 1:> What's up now? findbugs crashed...While struggling with https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/69099/ to finally switch the build to compile against neon I switched the build to java 8 and the findbugs version we currently use doesn't support Java 8. There are some bundles in neon which can't be unpacked by Java 7's unpack200 since they have been packed using Java 8 and Java 7 is unable to unpack them and p2 is too dumb to use the corresponding jar as a fallback :-(I switched back the egit.gerrit job to use Java 7 and retriggered the buildI am now first trying to find the cause for the problems I currently face with running egit core tests from maven (also using mars target platform). So I am now first bisecting these problems before tackling the additional problems caused by the switch to neon,1,3107,2016-04-05 22:13:28,2016-04-05 22:13:28,0,MERGED,2.0,42.0,4,9,1,0

And we need to test building with the coming milestones dependencies before it's actually released. - (minor) Using the simrel repos slow down download (index) and dependency resolution (in the case of CDT, it slows down *a lot*)So what I can do for now is have the 4.6 and staging target be the same and once Neon is out, they will start to differ.

The problem is that tab and org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote.tabs.RemoteCDSFMainTab do the same thing, but the latter for debug and the former for run. With the two different tabs for Main we end up in this situation that if you open Debug or Run launch ui, you end up with different UI on screen. I can better explain (with a screenshot if needed) when I get back to my desk.BTW if we don't deprecate RemoteCMainTab, we should not deprecate org.eclipse.cdt.launch.ui.CMainTab either. Final note, what I meant by:>  I don't think I will have time before M6/API freeze to rework this properly.is that I won't have time to refactor/review the code to be able to simply remove CMainTab and all children (including RemoteCMainTab) as that removal needs further updating the plugin.xml.

2185,"Patch Set 7:> ""allowNulls"", the design of the state system is that there should be no null values when returning from a query. It's not explicitely enforced in the backends' runtime code, but it could be. Testing this means testing cases that are not supposed to happen.When used along with a StateSystem, the query does not return null because the StateSystem first fills the interval list with a subset of the intervals and the backend fills it with the remaining subset, and both subsets complete each other and are mutually exclusive. So it is perfectly valid and expected in our runtime implementation that a backend does not fill some of the elements in the interval list. I could easily foresee test cases asserting that some elements must be null in the result of a query. These assertions could be checked after executing testDoQuery() which should therefore complete without failing.> The two ""abstract"" methods (getBackendForBuilding/getBackendForQuerying). The concept of ""reopening"" only applies to the HistoryTreeBackend, this notion should remain in that test class, not in the -Base. Parameters and the ""reopen"" constructor parameter is a nice way to offer both alternatives.Any backend could support reopening and then should override getBackendForQuerying(). Those backends that don't support it don't have to do anything. I think this is perfectly fine. My solution has the advantage to reduce code duplication. In the context of unit test code, I believe this is more important than conceptual considerations.> The abstract method I'm suggesting tells the implementation to ""create a backend and insert these intervals"". This is a clear initialization step.This clear initialization method is implemented in a final protected method that performs these steps in the base class in my patch. I think it is much better.> The pattern of an abstract method to set a protected field is used in other tests. It should be kept as consistent as possible.I hope you are not suggesting that forcing all subclasses to implement a method that can more easily be provided by the base class is preferable for reasons of consistency.I therefore respectfully disagree with your remaining objections. I think this patch is now way, way above the review threshold for unit test code.

Having both the -Base and a HistoryTreeBackendTest separates nicely what is specific to all backends (like the backend fixture), while HistoryTreeBackendTest owns what is specific to that backend, like the temp file.Good idea about splitting testDoQuery too, it will make it easy to re-use for different interval sets.I'd keep InMemoryBackendTest for another patch. We could move the tests in that class into the new base class to have them run on other backends.I'd also prefer to stick it to one abstract class that sets the backend.

2251,"Patch Set 2:Brian: (My apologies for the inappropriate ""Alex"") I checked now also the project eclipse.platform.runtime out which seemed to solve my startup problems and I can now run my test program. Two relevant observations from my Windows 7 machine:(a) The tool bar contribution (""Task!"") runs now and triggers the system task bar as expected. This fixes my most serious concern in regard to honoring the IProgressConstants2.SHOW_IN_TASKBAR_ICON_PROPERTY flag.(b) I can confirm that the system task bar is *not* yet triggered during the RCP startup process, there exists two reasons for this:(b.1) Previous 3.x Workbench code did enter in WorkbenchAdvisor.openWindows() a different code branch, because the lineIStatus status = myConfigurer[0].restoreState();could give a not-OK-status, this is no longer possible, because now WorkbenchConfigurer.restoreState() *always* returns OK_STATUS.(b.2) Now Workbench.createAndRunWorkbench does not wrap the splash handlers progress monitor using TaskBarDelegatingProgressMonitor.(b.3) My test program omits to set SHOW_PROGRESS_ON_STARTUP=true in the plugin_customization.iniTherefore my action items for this week end are:- Upload an improved test program that ensures that the startup presents progress on startup- Try to fix the second unwrapped progress monitorMy most serious concerns for this issue are fixing to honor IProgressConstants2.SHOW_IN_TASKBAR_ICON_PROPERTY. If I fail to complete my tasks during that weekend I would suggest to split the missing startup progress report using the system task bar into a second issue.

However since the build.index target doesn't need that property so it doesn't break anything).Unless you are talking about adding a <dependency> block like the others that are already there for the maven-antrun plugin?

2380,"Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1I'd like to see two things changed before submitting this:1. the JsonImporter has infrastructure to generate new UUIDs during import. This looks like a 1:1 implementation to the previous mechanism and is implicitly used when e.g. using ""Save As..."" for a project. However I can't see where this has been actually removed from the old XMLImporter. I'd like to see that infrastructure only being available at a single location.2. In addition to that I'd like to see a unified implicit usage of the ***Importer / ***Exporter for all ITE actions: currently ""Save As..."" is using the new Importer; ""Create new version..."" is still using the old one.",2,3743,2015-11-23 14:58:52,2015-12-17 13:48:24,574,MERGED,54.0,7844.0,2,4,7,0

2689,"Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1Seems to work on MacOS for valid links. Apparently also for broken links.However, I'm extremely wary of having these links editable in the compare editor. I get very strange things and follow-up errors if I edit a link in the compare editor and make it invalid in doing so.And I didn't even try to do really bad things, like setting the link content to multiple lines of text.In particular:0. Start off with a valid link in the workspace, pointing to another file in the workspace. (Link created with ln -s in shell, committed in shell, then pulled in EGit.)1. Select ""Context menu->Compare with index"" and edit the workspace link's contents (append a zero to make it invalid -- assuming there is no such file). Save.2. Link is shown in staging view as deleted. cgit git status reports it as modified.3. Stage and commit the broken link in EGit. 4. On disk, the broken link is still there! No error logged. Compare editor remains open. cgit reports the broken link suddenly as untracked.5. Do a ""Reset Hard"" on the parent commit. Now the valid link does not re-appear in package explorer. Even worse, it's gone on disk! cgit git status reports it as a staged deletion, and so does EGit's staging view. If I do the hard reset instead using cgit, the link is restored fine. Looks like EGit/JGit cannot restore a valid link if the workspace contains a broken link in that place.Other case:0: Start off with a valid top-level valid link (top-level is not in workspace) pointing to a file inside a project.1. On disk, break the link by doing ln -s doesntexist.txt link.txt2. In Eclipse, refresh staging view.2. Link is shown in git staging view as unstaged modification. Agrees with cgit.3. Stage and commit.4. In Eclipse, do a Reset hard on the parent commit (with the valid link).

3065,"Patch Set 4:(1 comment)Gabor, the latest patches of JDT Core and UI seem to be working quite well at a first glance. I am yet to test the feature properly. Before that, please have a look at the following as well:- It is not working for type names, e.g. when you type a substring of a class name to declare a field.- The relevance / proposal order is mixed up when fields are proposed with types. Example:public class C {	int intField;	String stringField;	{		field|	}}- In case of methods, the substring is also matched in its parameters, return type, declaring type etc. I think it should be restricted to only the method name.- Filtering of the results still seems to have some issue. Not sure if the filtered results look confusing or non-relevant due to the above issue of not restricting the match to just the name or if it is due to the non-subsequent matching. We can check that once the above issue is fixed. Also, pattern highlighting in the proposal will be very useful with this feature. Please check if it is simple to implement. Otherwise, we can do that later.",4,4800,2015-07-14 13:11:53,2015-07-27 12:12:26,311,MERGED,4.0,62.0,3,5,15,1

Now start typing ""long"" which is the parameter/return type of different methods and you still get proposals.- Please comment the non-subsequent substring match code in JDT/Core patch for now. - The camel case matching in Eclipse is broken now. In the above example, press ctrl+space after ""b.aSL"" and it doesn't complete to ""addSelectionListener(..)"". - Please include line comments and Javadocs with all the code changes in JDT/Core and JDT/UI patches to make the review simpler.- You should test the existing and new features properly before uploading new patch sets.Pending:- Substring completion for types (to be handled after substring completion works properly for methods).- Test cases.",8,4800,2015-07-14 13:11:53,2015-08-03 21:14:59,488,MERGED,1.0,10.0,3,5,15,0

During the latter, I've found that the camel case validation is done in isValidPrefix() and isPrefix(). This is confusing since the token is only a prefix if camel case and substring is disabled. I suppose, the names were chosen before support for camel case matching was added. For now, I have updated Javadoc to reflect how validation is done but have not touched the method names since that change would affect subclasses as well. However, I consider that renaming these methods to isValidToken() and isMatching() is something similar would make their roles more clear to future contributors.",12,4800,2015-07-14 13:11:53,2015-08-21 20:24:31,919,MERGED,4.0,62.0,3,5,15,1

3385,"Patch Set 24:The index of the toolbar buttons being clicked were wrong so I changed the code to get the buttons by using the tooltip text. This should be less error prone.Before, this worked most of the time because, depending on timing, the next/back buttons could fall on an event with the same call stack. Most of the time it was actually so quick that it should not even have time to select a different event. I changed testGoToTimeGoBackAndForthAndCheckStack to make sure that it waits for the expected event to be selected and also so that it checks the call stack at every step (prev/next event). There is no API to access the current selected event in the Call Stack view so I thought the next best thing was to inspect the selected event in the table.After those changes, the test is not flaky anymore on my machine (100 times).",24,5244,2015-09-11 14:46:31,2015-09-28 00:29:11,393,MERGED,4.0,363.0,4,9,24,1

It's the branch that always points to the latest release. The Git master branch does not have this semantic.Also my guess is that in most cases, when users want to convert their repository to Gitflow, it would make more sense to turn the existing master into develop (e.g. the EGit repository).",4,5398,2015-08-28 21:44:57,2015-09-09 22:53:08,289,MERGED,10.0,386.0,3,6,6,1

Also while the editor is open, it will not switch over to other drafts upon clicking them.To reflect these changes, we are now using a Multimap to represent the open and editable dialogs.

Guava ArrayBackedList(?) was proposed.

4151,"Patch Set 3:I think the only other concern I has was exception handling. There are quite a few places where SnapshotException is caught, and it is either wrapped in a RuntimeException or reported as an error.In some cases we have to do one of those since the catching method cannot throw a checked exception, but we should make sure that the choice of throwing SnapshotException, wrapping in RuntimeException, or reporting the error is correct.In general, is the approach that ""user facing"" things like queries should report errors, but that ""code facing"" things like the collection extraction API should throw exceptions?There are some places where the existing query code catches SnapshotException and reports an error, but since the logic is now pushed inside the collection extraction API it throws a runtime exception and the query no longer catches it (e.g. CollectionFillRatioQuery). This means that previously there would be an error reported to the user but it would now lead to an uncaught RuntimeException.If we wanted to not wrap in RuntimeException, basically every method that does not implement an existing API would need to throw SnapshotException since implementing code may want to call another method that does. Even then, the code implementing an existing API like Iterator would still have to wrap SnapshotException in RuntimeException.",3,6511,2015-03-04 00:01:25,2015-05-26 13:28:38,2005,MERGED,44.0,6527.0,2,4,4,1
4152,"Patch Set 3: Code-Review+1Unless we wanted to alter the exception handling (I'd originally thought ""I'll fix that later""), I'm fine to have it committed - we can fix any bugs as they arise.I think it would still be a good idea to allow other plugins to add supported collections (via an extension point), but since I've lost my code to do that I'll have to re-write it. That won't break any API just add some more, so that is fine to do later for next year's releases.",3,6511,2015-03-04 00:01:25,2015-05-26 13:28:38,2005,MERGED,44.0,6527.0,2,4,4,0

4303,"Patch Set 7:> I submitted it without gear enablement check, if you want to be > fancy > you can add error decorator on the gear in case of errors (instead > of removing it)I really think that doesn't make sense at all.   The method name is isEditable(etc), and it is now returning 'true' when in fact it cannot be edited. Not only does it not make sense on the code level, I will also have several launch descriptors where even the idea that it could be edited will be confusing to a user.  And finally, I think popping up dialogs for situations we already know won't work doesn't make sense. I don't like the idea of putting an error decorator on the gear. This implies the descriptor SHOULD be editable, but something is wrong, and so it cannot. This is not the case for my descriptors. There's nothing wrong with them. They simply cannot be edited.

But you are right that it could be nice for the single process case.  We could look into an enhancement to show the exited process node even after GDB dies. I suggest we do that separately.  Note that the exit code is still visible in the title of the console in that case (as long as the process exited on its own).  > * I like this additional way to restart the terminated process from > the same session :-)Me too :)  But of course, that can only work if GDB is kept alive. > * Using the setting to ""Automatically debug forked process"" and > getting a small program which sequentially creates child forked > processes, don't preserve the exit code for all children but one. > This may be related to the collision of re-used group ids.Thanks for doing that test.

Before 4.4. if you applied a theme and afterwards another theme all stuff that was not overriden in the new theme remained styled as in the first theme.

If you switch from theme A to B, everything would be set to ""default"" and afterwards everything would be styled accordingly to B. This allows new themes to control everything without side effects from older themes. Please note that we still have a few bugs in the reset stuff, e.g., Form controls do not all support the reset functionality.So in your case, if I switch from one theme to ""Something else"" all styling must be resetted to the default, e.g., preferences, colors, etc. As you are now argue this reset requirement away for the OS settings in this review, we also tried to argue that away for the preferences but this was strongly requested by the JDT team.",3,6922,2015-04-17 10:16:07,2015-04-17 10:16:07,0,MERGED,14.0,218.0,3,13,10,1

I don't like that because it makes the code less generic, and it may happen that the output of ""-info-os cpus"" does change2- we put a cache in GDBHardwareAndOS_7_10.  This makes sense because it is that service that knows if the data it uses can change.  Personally, I'd use a global array of ICoreInfo[] that gets filled once and then re-used.

Problem is with filtering by mylyn workingset (see also bug 460592).IType.getChildren() isn't important, because namespace and type declarations should be reported on same level (IType.getNamespace() and you can forget about namespace declaration, also see what happens in IType.getParent()). Like in JDT for one type per file pattern. Import declarations use only package names (bug 455754). In general, IPackageDeclaration is lighter than IType.

4486,"Patch Set 1:Sorry, I was on easter vacation and couldn't respond early enough.Could we please revert this change?  It dramatically reduces theperformance in case of non-bare repositories. Hey Shawn, what'sup? I have not seen such a small change with such a bad performanceimpact passing your review eyes :-)Semantically I think this change is correct. We want to avoiddealing with pathes where there are no diffs. How to achieve that?You could either apply a ANY_DIFF filter to the treewalk or comparethe tree entries manually when walking over the unfiltered trees.Previously ResolveMerger was manually comparing TreeEntriesand skipped over those where there are no diffs. Now you added the ANY_DIFF filter.ANY_DIFF sounds logical but performance wise it's not soo good.Its a very generic filter which compares content-IDs of all participatingTreeIterators. It doesn't differentiate between the differentiterators and blindly computes id's for the content unless it findsdifferent ids. If the treewalk happens to have a FileSystem basedWorkingTreeIterator included this means that you will have to readnearly every single File in the working tree and compute it's content SHA1to do the merge. ANY_DIFF has no idea that there may be a DirCacheIteratoralso in the TreeWalk which already contains the SHA1 of the non-dirtyworkingtree files. ANY_DIFF will always compute the SHA1 again. Onlyexception: if ANY_DIFF detects already a difference between e.g.OURS and THEIRS then it knows early that there is a diff and canskip calculating SHA1's for filesystem content.If we manually do the detection of diffs in an unfiltered treewalkwe can be much faster. Look at ResolveMerger.processEntry() to lookat all the cheap shortcuts we can use. E.g. if the index is dirty(somebody added something for that path) we can let the merge fail becauseof that.If OURS, THEIRS, BASE don't contain anything for that path we knowit's only index and working tree which may contain something for thefile - no need to process this path during the merge. If OURSis equal to BASE then the merge result is clear: It must be in THEIRS.All these are decisions we can take and completely ignoring whatsin the expensive working tree.Long talk - but here comes real world performance measurements showinghow this change compares performance wise to it's predecessor commit.

Then assign p1 and p2 to w1; p2 and p3 to w2.Next, try to DnD p1 and p2 (together) from w1 to w2. The result is that p1 is moved to w2, but p2 is not removed from w1.In Package Explorer this operation is not allowed (i.e. moving a group of projects which contain some projects that are already in the target working set).I think that for now we should keep the same behavior in both explorers.I also took a quick look at the code. In addition to inline comments:1. Could you change the commit message to the most prevalent format? I mean:""Bug 390348 - [CommonNavigator] Ability to drag projects between Working SetsChange-Id: Ia8ca4eefc76056c2f349488d98b8faf17db9c13aSigned-off-by: Mickael Istria <mistria@redhat.com>""2.

Otherwise our automated builds would have detected this bug before.I guess the reason is that the pom.xml already contains the needed dependency. Yes, it's a shame that we have two parallel ways how we define dependencies.

4763,"Patch Set 1:None as far as I can see. The class (PathEnvironmentVariable) is private and only used to contribute to the PATH environment variable when cross-compiling. The contribution is the path to the cross compiler you specify in your project settings. Normally that path is prepended. It normally works fine, unless you use say ${ARM_TOOL_PATH} which java.io.File does not understand. It assumes ${ARM_TOOL_PATH} is some form of weird folder name in cwd and hence prepends c:\program files\...\eclipse\bin resulting in a non-existing directory being added to the path. I can't image you'd want to use a relative path to your compiler. If relative, relative to what? Here's a few examples:Cross path: C:\myarmcompilerBefore: C:\myarmcompilerAfter: C:\myarmcompilerCross path: myarmcompilerBefore: C:\program files\Eclipse\myarmcompilerAfter: C:\myarmcompilerCross path: ${ARM_TOOL_PATH} (and ARM_TOOL_PATH=c:\mycompiler)Before: C:\program files\Eclipse\c:\mycompilerAfter: c:\mycompilerIf some user really depends on specifying the cross compiler relative to the eclipse bin dir, I suggest they use ${ECLIPSE_HOME}\myarmcompiler which is also a lot more explicit.",1,7571,2015-02-17 17:53:11,2015-02-17 17:53:11,0,MERGED,1.0,2.0,3,11,2,1

4802,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1Adding strong dependency to JDT is a no go IMHO.The problem is that egit can be used in Eclipse installations without JDT.If the dependency is really needed and can't be avoided, it should be made optional and the related code should be written in the way that it can gracefully terminate if JDT classes aren't abailable. It can be done either with try/catch around related code oder with checks before if the related JDT bundle is available in the current system.Small small issues with the patch: - formatting is inconsistent (check especially the spaces around ""if"" conditions) - most external class names are written full qualified in the code which avoids imports and made the code not that readable - commit message format: we use ""Bug: number"" style.",1,7625,2015-02-08 19:07:59,2015-02-08 19:19:50,0,MERGED,8.0,153.0,3,4,6,1

And how can the user create filters with no trace opened if he has to go look for field names in another view, which will be empty because no trace is opened?Well you could create a filter monitoring for a certain critical alarm detail without any trace where the alarm has ever happened.> In a sense TmfEventFieldAspect is just a shim between the new aspect API and ITmfEventField.I think it's a useful framework support for any aspect that is made of fields and sub-fields.What I find restrictive about it is that it can only be used for fields that are stored in the event content. I'll update it so that it can be extended to use any other member of the event (that is an ITmfEventField). That will allow for more than one column with fields, without needing them both to be necessarily stored as their own roots in the event content.",2,7784,2014-12-17 22:45:09,2015-01-12 22:26:37,623,MERGED,1.0,56.0,3,5,6,1

Cool!Since the menu action toggles the filters, and we've already synchronized the content provider, we should really just invoke the same code when toggling the content provider. This would fix Case 3 and give a good user experience.Some other issues I found during testing:- The selection gets lost when switching Projects Presentation. This is bad UI behavior and switching Top Level elements also preserves the selection.- The menu items swap:	- first time the new menu item is second	- exit and restart: the new menu item is at the top	You need to specify the order/position relative to the existing item (Top Level Elements) - afaik this is possible- Empty folders get the + (or >) sign, but clicking does nothing.

5040,"Patch Set 8:> I'm not sure why you're moving the information about disabled actionSets from the actionSets into the page hidden.  It is not moving but adding the persistence layer.> Is it just the regular mechanism is disconnected? I didn't get it, sorry.> For any given window, the perspective worked with the ActionSetManager to turn on or off actionSets (it seems to do it via the IContextService). It doesn't matter what the defaults were when the perspective was created, only that the perspective remember what actionSets are active at the moment.This is still true, but ActionSetManager (and also no one else) never persisted the ""disabled"" action sets as user choice. So you could request to show/hide them (depending on the application needs), but once user decides to get rid of some action set, this decision must ""override"" application choice. The best example is the debug action sett with the global debug buttons. In the old implementation you could try to ""hide"" them - but on next restart they will come back again, or, even worse, as soon as you hit a breakpoint - and this mean they will be back in a minute. See the nice comment about it in the LaunchView (written *before* the big e4 changes), line 1442:			// When the launch view becomes visible, turn on the			// debug action set. Note that the workbench will handle the			// case where the user really doesn't want the action set			// enabled - showActionSet(String) will do nothing for an			// action set that's been manually disabled.",8,7937,2014-12-21 15:32:17,2015-01-07 12:52:48,405,MERGED,3.0,66.0,4,7,14,1

5316,"Patch Set 2:(5 comments)Undo/redo works well.  Thanks!  It looks odd, though, that undo/redo changes the selection in the Model Explorer even when focus is currently in a diagram editor.  Especially if I have ""link with editor"" turned on in the explorer because in that case, the linking of the selection doesn't actually happen (which is a good thing, but looks like a bug).  I would expect the changed selection on undo/redo to be reflected in the diagram, but it isn't.  It's only selection changes caused by mouse or keyboard in the explorer view that are propagated to the diagram.Anyways, that can all be avoided simply by having the RevealResultCommand do its thing only if its view part is currently active.  That's actually better than what I suggested last time (I suggested then that the command should operate on whatever is the current view, but that would be bad, because that view may provide IRevealSemanticElement but not be the explorer, which would be confusing at best).",2,8433,2014-10-30 10:50:23,2014-11-04 15:49:49,124,MERGED,13.0,764.0,2,3,3,0

You have created a new patch, which is not that good.2. You created a new example, which is also good. :) But I asked for tests. We have several JUnit test cases in the org.eclipse.nebula.widgets.nattable.core.test project. Adding the test cases will help us to verify that everything is working as expected and if anybody changes code later, it still works.3. I can see the whitespace issues in the Gerrit web view. Just open your changes there and you will see them marked red.I haven't pushed the modified code as I'm waiting for your modifications. :) And Gerrit will nofify you when I've done it.Greez,DirkP.S.

5613,"Patch Set 5:(2 comments)Hi,I've been working on this change-set, but unfortunately I get an error when trying to push the changes to gerrit[2].Until I manage to solve it and push the code, I thought it's best to write some comments about the changes I made.I found this forum post [1] that describes a way to solve the dirty editor problems. Basically, we'll need to call the doSave() method for all the editor pages to remove their dirty status. After this, calling the editorDirtyStateChanged(); method will remove the * mark from the editor.There are more comments in-line.[1]: http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/96716/[2]: Resolving deltas: 100% (16/16)Processing changes: refs: 1, done----------Reviewing commit: a88dc2a0Authored by: Andreas Sewe <andreas.sewe@codetrails.com>The author is a committer on the project.error: You are not a project committer.error: Only project committers can push on behalf of others.Please see http://wiki.eclipse.org/CLA",5,8960,2014-06-12 19:10:02,2014-07-10 07:24:01,660,MERGED,19.0,705.0,2,4,18,1

5616,"Patch Set 8:(3 comments)> If I create a new snippet (Either through the ""Create Snippet"" context menu or through ""Add"" in the Snippets view) the snippet doesn't start out as needing to be saved (the little * symbol).Hi Andreas,I am not sure if this is a bug. I think this is the normal behavior of an editor. For example, if you create a new Java class in your IDE, the java editor won't pop-up and expect you to save the class before making any modifications to it.I think the snippet editor should not do this either.And you are right, the data-binding framework and the form editor framework are both tracking changes in the view/model. If we use only the form editor framework, we'll have to update the model by hand. (See the in-line comments)Also, I just realized that I might have made a mistake when using the data binding framework. This will update the model whenever changes occur in the editor, but we need to update it only when the save action takes place (i.e. in the commit method of the form parts). Although this is not visible as it only updates the in-memory model, not the actual json file, I think we still should avoid it. So this would be another +1 for not using the data binding framework.",8,8960,2014-06-12 19:10:02,2014-08-13 08:54:17,1477,MERGED,20.0,743.0,3,14,18,1

As this is a big change, we'll need some time to properly test it, so let's push it.Minor bug: the validation decorator is not removed from the widget when changing selection.Steps to reproduce:- Select an element with a validation warning/error- Select another element of the same typeFor example:- Create 3 Classes (Class1, Class2, Class3)- Rename Class3 to Class1 (Which adds a warning for conflicting name)- Select Class2: the warning is still displayed, although Class2 is not a conflicting name> Uploaded patch set 6.Rebased patch set 5 (Solved 1 trivial conflict on a Manifest)",6,9145,2014-05-23 02:44:04,2014-08-07 09:17:38,1830,MERGED,83.0,4865.0,2,5,6,1
5747,"Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1I've been playing a little bit with the selection and tab changes, and at some point the Appearance tab became completely empty. (Apparently, this happens when switching from the Diagram's ""General"" tab and a graphical element's ""Appearance"" tab. And the tab remains empty until I switch e.g. from a Class to a Property, probably because they have different contents in their appearance tab)Steps:- Create a Class diagram with classes and properties- Select the diagram and go to the General tab- Select a Class and go to the Appearance tab- Switch back to the diagram: the General tab is empty- Switch back to the class: the Appearance tab is empty- Select a Property: the Appearance tab is now populated- Select the Class: the Appearance tab is now populated- Select the Diagram: the General tab is still empty- Repeat from step 3 :)Performances are otherwise really good, when switching between similar elements. Maybe this could be extended to ""Similar Sections"" (In addition to ""Similar Tabs""): for the Appearance tab, almost all sections are the same, and this is the most heavy properties tab. Currently, if we reuse the same sections between two selections, but add a new one (or remove it), everything is redrawn (Although 80% of the contents is the same)I also have quite a lot of exceptions when switching selection, especially in the dispose() methods, when using multiple selection (I'll attach the log file to the associated bugzilla)",3,9145,2014-05-23 02:44:04,2014-06-10 17:41:15,446,MERGED,74.0,4208.0,3,6,6,0

5995,"Patch Set 1:What is the problem of initializing the default in the Activator? Do you have any suggestion as an alternative? From where we should call setDefaultAuthenticatorFactory/setUserAuthenticatorFactory? The idea of having a default, was that the core can rely on there being one as long as a UI plugin has been loaded.

6037,"Patch Set 2:> The run in background button does not change the busycursor while hovering over it. The cancel button acts ok.Nice catch!  This warrants a bug for ProgressMonitorDialog to encapsulate the protected arrowCursor.  See my latest patch for the workaround. > When pressing ""Clear model cache"" i get an unrelated message in the dialog (The search was cancelled.  Not all results may have been displayed.)The filter can still search while the index job is running.  It starts a search job.  Clearing the cache cancels that job.  The search finds all items by default without typing, so it was most likely running when you cleared the cache.  See the progress view to verify there are 2 jobs running.I like having results in the table immediately, and that is why the search starts before typing anything.  Especially when the default 'Project Only' is selected. > When pressing ""run in background"", the list is not updated upon completion.The results will only update when the filter is changed due to lack of provider feedback.  See final comment on provider status callback. This is a very narrow scoped feature with much overhead.  I can't see initializing on startup, or even when the dialog first opens.  It should only happen on first use.  The provider chooses to to initialize, and the GUI has no idea this is even taking place.  The current filter/provider mechanism has no callbacks regarding initialization (only a clear cache method).   This leaves us with 2 choices:  Go back to the modal dialog with cancel option, or create a provider status callback mechanism.  I am leaning towards the thought that if you can't use the filter while the provider is initializing, there is no harm in the modal dialog.

When I remove a column, the column stays, but when I try to add it, it adds a new duplicate one.5- If I scroll down the view and then change the debug context (but stay in the same launch) the view scrolls back to the top.  I think it would be more user-friendly to not change the view at all.  Maybe it is as simple as noticing that the context change can be ignored since the ICommandControlDMContext is the same.6- I got this NPE when switching from one launch to antoher sometimes.  I might have screwed up my launch, but it shows that it could happen:java.lang.NullPointerException    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.osview.OSResourcesView.setDebugContext(OSResourcesView.java:256)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.osview.OSResourcesView.setDebugContext(OSResourcesView.java:245)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.osview.OSResourcesView.access$4(OSResourcesView.java:214)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.osview.OSResourcesView$4.debugContextChanged(OSResourcesView.java:193)    at org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.contexts.DebugWindowContextService$1.run(DebugWindowContextService.java:212)    at org.eclipse.core.runtime.SafeRunner.run(SafeRunner.java:42)    at org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.contexts.DebugWindowContextService.notify(DebugWindowContextService.java:210)    at org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.contexts.DebugWindowContextService.notify(DebugWindowContextService.java:185)    at org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.contexts.DebugWindowContextService.debugContextChanged(DebugWindowContextService.java:408)    at org.eclipse.debug.ui.contexts.AbstractDebugContextProvider$1.run(AbstractDebugContextProvider.java:79)7- In all-stop mode, I like how the menus become grayed out when the target is not available.  However, the 'fetch' link remains usable, which will trigger a ""Fething data..."" which will only complete once the inferior is interrupted8- If there are multiple debug contexts selected,  the code choosed the first one arbitrarily.  This is not clear to the user. I suggest one of two things:  a) If all selected contexts have the same parent ICommandControlDMContext, then display resources as done now using any one context. If the parents are different, then disable and empty the view or   b) Always disable and empty the view for multi-selection9- The case where -info-os returns an error does not seem to be handled properly.  For example, if I have the OSResources view open when using a post-mortem session (core file), GDB gives:   448,664 [MI]  24-info-os   448,666 [MI]  24^error,msg=""Can not fetch data now.""   or   600,684 [MI]  25-info-os modules   600,686 [MI]  25^error,msg=""Can not fetch data now.""But the view is stuck showing ""Determining available OS resource classes..."" or ""Fetching data..."" depending on the timing.10- One time I got the following reply from GDB (maybe my gdbserver was wrong), but it caused an NPE that I think we should guard against:   915,516 [MI]  42-info-os semaphores   921,522 [MI]  ~""Ignoring packet error, continuing...\n""   921,523 [MI]  42^error,msg=""Can not fetch data now.""Exception in thread ""MI RX Thread"" java.lang.NullPointerException    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.output.MIInfoOsInfo.get(MIInfoOsInfo.java:173)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.output.MIInfoOsInfo.parseResourcesInformation(MIInfoOsInfo.java:128)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.output.MIInfoOsInfo.<init>(MIInfoOsInfo.java:75)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.commands.MIInfoOs.getResult(MIInfoOs.java:47)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.commands.MIInfoOs.getResult(MIInfoOs.java:1)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.AbstractMIControl$RxThread.processMIOutput(AbstractMIControl.java:907)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.AbstractMIControl$RxThread.run(AbstractMIControl.java:754)11- The new osresources.gif icon should go under the view16 folder and should be renamed to osresources_view.gif,    i.e., dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/icons/full/view16/osresources_view.gif    Don't forget to update the plugin.xml file to match12- In MANIFEST.MF, please export the new osview package, as the other packages are exported",7,9709,2012-05-05 08:54:55,2012-09-12 08:43:28,3119,MERGED,17.0,1896.0,2,4,9,1

I'll let Shawn comment on the code changes, but I can confirm that it fixes the issue listed in this bug:https://code.google.com/p/gitiles/issues/detail?id=5I looked at the difference between C git and JGit blame for all of ReceiveCommits.java after applying this patch. There are still a few places where they differ, but almost all of them are on trivial lines (e.g. only whitespace and a curly brace), so I'm guessing those are instances where there is not just one correct answer.You can examine the output yourself with:$ vimdiff <(git blame 61dcc102242e00d3b0061405d5c909564ebbd819 gerrit-server/src/main/java/com/google/gerrit/server/git/ReceiveCommits.java) <(~/c/jgit/org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/target/jgit blame 61dcc102242e00d3b0061405d5c909564ebbd819 gerrit-server/src/main/java/com/google/gerrit/server/git/ReceiveCommits.java)(While doing this I also noticed some more inconsistencies between C git and JGit blame that are beyond the scope of this change but I though I'd write down:-C git extends the SHA-1 abbreviations to 8 characters in the full-file case, perhaps because there was actually ambiguity among the set of SHA-1s that showed up in the range?-Ranges like -L 25,35 appear to be inclusive of the high endpoint in JGit but exclusive in C git.)",1,9995,2014-04-13 17:21:06,2014-04-13 17:33:29,0,MERGED,4.0,224.0,4,6,6,1

The old code was flat out wrong to skip commits already marked SEEN. They could be reached by more than one path, and in blame model that second path is carrying lines that need to be processed.The approach here is roughly correct. If the candidate is still in the queue, merge in the regions from the 2nd (or nth) path for future processing. If it was already popped, put it back in and reprocess that part of the DAG until you find an ancestor candidate that is still sitting in the queue and can have the region(s) merged into it.I mostly had style nits, and some questions about why the time equality topo sort is necessary.",1,9995,2014-04-13 17:21:06,2014-04-13 17:33:29,0,MERGED,4.0,224.0,4,6,6,1

Another option would be to use a synchronizedMap instead:  fChildren = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap<String, TmfStatisticsTreeNode>());Although this implementation locks ""more"" than the concurrent hashmap (the whole map is locked every time a writer tries to access it, whereas ConcurrentHashMap has more localized locking), it does support null values.",1,10124,2014-03-21 13:37:10,2014-03-21 13:42:19,0,MERGED,1.0,4.0,3,5,4,0

6603,"Patch Set 2:(16 comments)Thanks for the valuable feedback!Regarding the distinction of C++11 attributes and GCC attributes: I left the GCC attributes as is and added the attribute specifiers for representing C++11 attributes. The distinction can be seen for example in the NodeWriter. If an I(CPP)ASTAttribute is encountered in a IASTAttributeOwner it is expected to be a GCC attribute. If an ICPPASTAttributeSpecifier is encountered there, it is expected to be a C++11 attribute. The previous implementation of attributes is a bit limiting regarding the capabilities required by C++11 attributes (scope and multiple attributes in one specifier).I also thought about a solution which introduces an attribute specifier for GCC attributes, but that would break the current API. It's related to the problem mentioned in my comment (Line 23) in ICPPASTAttributeSpecifier.",2,10251,2014-01-30 08:46:18,2014-02-26 12:06:41,651,MERGED,39.0,1681.0,3,6,10,1

6608,"Patch Set 4:> We can extend IASTAttributeOwner to contain separate methods for accessing C++11 and GCC attributes and a convenience method for getting all attributes at once. Alternatively, the latter method can be external to IASTAttributeOwner.Sure, I'll do that.

6664,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1Hi,thanks for contributing via Gerrit. I know about the contribution in the ticket itself, but I didn't had time to dig into this in more detail.Some things about your contribution:1. It seems you have the trailing whitespace issue. Looking at the ScrollBarHandlerTemplate there seem to be more changes marked as there are really. Could you please try to solve that so checking the changes is easier?2. This change may break backwards compatibility in case the ActiveCellEditorRegistry was used outside NatTable to perform modifications inside. Like exchanging the data or deleting a current selected value (e.g. https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=425176)Although the intention about the change is correct, I would like to keep the AbstractCellEditorRegistry for backwards compatibility. But it should be marked as deprecated, pointing to the new instance and telling about the issue when using it further. So users who will update won't get compile errors immediatelly.3. ScrollBarHandlerTemplateAlthough I'm not quite sure how to solve it better, I don't like the solution so far. The first thing is the instanceof check that seems to be not necessary. I thought you wanted to get rid of it?The second thing is that this change might not be compatible with the split viewport feature that was added lately. If you check the _703_HorizontalSplitViewportExample you will see that the sliders will be created by using the parent composite of the NatTable instance and are then added later on. So in case of split viewports, your change will break functionality.",1,10320,2014-01-13 13:15:12,2014-01-20 22:46:04,177,MERGED,11.0,656.0,2,3,8,0
6665,Patch Set 1:I pushed it to gerrit for easier communication. Doing stuff through Bugzilla is just too complicated.@1: There went something wrong when merging. I will correct that.@2: AbstractCellEditorRegistry: Will try to keep the instance and update it whenever the editor gets created/disposed.@3: I would need to do an API change in order to pass in the table to the handler. If this is OK i can do it. Otherwise i do not see how this can be solved. Thanks for the review :),1,10320,2014-01-13 13:15:12,2014-01-20 22:46:04,177,MERGED,11.0,656.0,2,3,8,1

6723,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1(11 comments)Hi GenevieveI like your effort to simplify the creation of tree viewers for displaying trace data that supports the TMF time range and selection synchronization. I created one simple viewer with hardcoded data and it was straight forward.However, I see a lot of overlap of this with the packages  org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.viewers.statistics.model, org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.viewers.statistics. The classes TmfBaseColumnData, TmfBaseColumnDataProvider and ITmfColumnDataProvider could be re-used here. Would it be possible to extract the common parts from the statistics packages and use it with the abstract tree viewer?",1,10357,2014-02-17 15:26:19,2014-02-18 20:03:04,28,MERGED,5.0,893.0,3,6,3,0
6724,"Patch Set 1:(1 comment)Hi Bernd,Indeed, I took some inspiration from the statistics. And as I was talking with Alex, the statistics is unncessarily complicated, and with the analysis framework, the statistics framework is not as useful as it used to be.So once this is accepted, the statistics will be rewritten to make use of this simpler version and a lot of code will go! So I preferred to start from the minimal requirements, if it means adding new methods eventually, than try to remove from the existing code.",1,10357,2014-02-17 15:26:19,2014-02-18 20:03:04,28,MERGED,5.0,893.0,3,6,3,0
6725,"Patch Set 1:Well the statistic framework has some features which are currently not used and that's why it seems complicated for what it is used for. Unfortunately, it's only be used for event counts and it's not possible to see the potential of it. It could have been used for many other statistics. BTW, I didn't write the code but the design was based on my proposal to the student who did it during his internship. Please update the code according to the comments. Also, give credit to the original author of code that was migrated.",1,10357,2014-02-17 15:26:19,2014-02-18 20:03:04,28,MERGED,5.0,893.0,3,6,3,0

6727,"Patch Set 2:Hi Bernd, I added the column provider, as it may be useful for some cases and it doesn't add any overhead. But except for the interfaces, the classes themselves are too statistics centric to be re-used here. The statistics is a special use case of the tree viewer and it can be made to use these new classes. I'll leave that to someone else though, maybe as an exercice for the new students to start with TMF views?I took the column data and provider from the statistics framework. But for the abstract tree viewer and entries themselves, it is inspired from pretty much all other TMF views (time graph, xy charts, statistics)",2,10357,2014-02-17 15:26:19,2014-02-25 16:01:48,192,MERGED,6.0,926.0,3,6,3,0

6855,Patch Set 15: Code-Review+1A good starting point for symlink tests regarding checkout. +1 from me.An idea for more tests: All the tests here work mainly with two different states.

So we need (maybe in subsequent changes) tests where the working tree is dirty (differs from index) and where we have staged but uncommitted changes.,15,10435,2013-12-03 09:25:05,2014-02-10 22:29:34,1669,MERGED,2.0,264.0,4,5,20,1

6886,"Patch Set 2:Hi Robin and Matthias,unfortunately this change worsens the situation on Windows for the commit message view. The diff view seems to work fine with the change.The permanently shown, but inactive vertical scrollbar is gone, as intended by the fix. Instead there is now a a permanently active horizontal scrollbar. In addition to that, moving the mouse around in the commit message view causes both a horizontal and a vertical scrollbar to appear and flicker annoyingly.As the original problem of showing an inactive scrollbar is only a minor one, I propose to change the code in CommitMessageViewer toif (!SystemReader.getInstance().isWindows())	t.setAlwaysShowScrollBars(false);",2,10456,2013-12-19 21:41:26,2013-12-19 23:35:41,1,MERGED,2.0,2.0,4,8,2,1

After our discussion on the ticket to solve the test failures, we've found out that the reason for the failure was something else. So you decided to not apply the modified test cases with setup and teardown.On the one hand it is not bad practice to have test cases with setup and teardown and it will make adding test cases easier.On the other hand, the test cases are succeeding the way they are and everything is fine.So it's up to you if you want to add the modifications or abandon them.

7161,"Patch Set 1:If that is the common concept in e4, than of course I agree.Just one thing to consider: Looking into the implementation, there are three steps that need to be performed for a locale change:1. setting the context value for TranslationService.LOCALE2. notify the application model3. sending the event1. and 3. are easy to achieve as it is one line of code anywhere. 2. is a bit more complicated. But as LocaleChangeServiceImpl.updateLocalization() is protected, people could extend it for their own implementation. We could also think of making this method a static helper method, so people are able to simply use it for their use cases.If people are forced to implement their own stuff in such special cases (which is really fine for me), than we should at least provide as much help as possible and not leave them in copying framework code.",1,10679,2013-12-05 14:30:08,2013-12-13 08:38:43,186,MERGED,1.0,77.0,5,10,3,0

7354,"Patch Set 2:> This is by design. Merely changing null.unboxInt() to return 0 instead of -1 will break MANY things only in the state system (like stack attributes, off the top of my head). And that's without talking about views.There's a few things broken as it is now:- You can't get a -1 Int value from the factory method but you can get one using incrementAttribute() on a -2 Int value- Calling incrementAttribute() on this -1 Int value skips 0 and goes to 1.- The State System Explorer view cannot display a factory-made -1 Int value (as it is nullValue), it shows a blank value.If there is any code that is using the unboxed value of nullValue to check for null, that is badly designed code because it cannot differentiate with a real Int of that same value, it should use isNull(). I believe it's better to bite the bullet and correct that code now. Hopefully all of it is fixed by the patch now.Mathematically, I think it makes more sense to use zero as the null value's numerical value.> This is also by design. If we start to allow unboxing from one type to another, people might stop caring about what the actual type is, and always unbox their things into longs for example, doing costly casts over and over.It's a point to consider, but I prefer to give the benefit of the doubt and the flexibility to the designers. In the code I'm doing now, I have to do floating point mathematical operations on a list of state values that can be a mix of Int, Long, Double or nullValue. Using unboxDouble() gives much cleaner code than having a if-else or switch statement on the value Type to figure out the correct unboxing method.The unit tests should be correct now. The LTTng kernel state system creates a Threads/-1 attribute because the first events arrive before the Current_thread attribute has any value set. I considered updating the expected test state system with these events using the Threads/0 attribute (due to the current thread nullValue's int value), but decided against it because it would still be incorrect to consider that these events occurred in the swapper (0) thread. So the nullValue current thread continues uses the -1 attribute for the 'unknown' thread.",2,10842,2013-09-12 22:00:50,2013-09-13 19:47:48,21,MERGED,7.0,51.0,3,6,6,0

7978,"Patch Set 6:Just to add to the mix, I'm considering working on an approach where state systems are built in-band with the trace (trace calls buildStateSystem(), construction starts. trace calls dispose(), construction stops if applicable, files and closed and cleaned up if needed). a.k.a do away with the HistoryBuilder abomination entirely.We're having a bug right now with traces with 0 events: one part of the system is still waiting for the signal to start, and another part is trying to close it. Pain and tears ensue. Moving to the in-band approach would undoubtedly be the correct way to fix this.(those is-the-statesystem-started-yet? latches make me cringe ;) )However, this is a very big undertaking. It might be worth focusing on the future instead, where the ""analysis"" is the owner of the state system. Where it would control and know when construction is started and when it's done. We could learn from history, and do it right this time.",6,11339,2013-08-15 20:29:19,2013-08-15 20:30:48,0,MERGED,2.0,70.0,3,6,10,1

Nothing wrong with that, but we will have to update them when we do the EMF edit part.  Finally I'm having a few observations/questions on the model:    For the Approval and Requirements, I think the model is generic enough, although I never worked with requirements in Gerrit and I'm not sure how they work really.    I think the model is overly complex now with ReviewItemSets, ReviewItems and File items.  Do we really need the ReviewItem element anymore?

What is the rationale behind this?  Can't all the info be in a single Review EClass?  Insn't Change a little bit too Gerrit-specific?  Also, I noticed that review now has Change parents and childrens elements.  I suppose this is to take care of the Depends and Needs Changes in Gerrit to see dependencies accross reviews.  Am I right in this?    The TaskReference is gone from the Review, but is still in the ReviewGroup.  I am a little confused by this.  I thought that the REview itself was a Mylyn task, so now where is the link?  Also, why do we still have a taskReference at the Review Group level?  I don't think we need it.    The location right now is restricted to line ranges i.e. textual input.  This will eventually have to change if we want to support Model Reviews, where the ""location"" is not a line range.

Those are FileItem, FileVersion and ReviewItemSet	addedBy (apply to all)	committedBy  (apply to all)	name  (apply to all)	id  (apply to all)	reference  (apply to all)	set (only for FileItems (that is, whatever the real base review item is)So we could move set to FileItem but otherwise I think the abstraction is useful.> I saw that you introduced a Change element as a Review superclass.  What is> the rationale behind this?  Can't all the info be in a single Review EClass?I isolated Change because it supports those changes that don't have an associated review. And it's also a practical thing because we want to be able to create one-off parent and children changes attached to reviews. These aren't actually changes per se, they're (in Gerrit) simply git references. I think this distinction is useful beyond Gerrit as you're likely to want to have change references that allow you to see the dependency tree..?> Also, I noticed that review now> has Change parents and childrens elements.

9090,"Patch Set 8:The code was adapted to work with the new Remotes API that was just merged in.  Basically the functionality is as before and is tested (except for comparing review items which I could not test due to new bug 403389).There is one part missing to resolve the File Revisions when opening a file from the Review Navigator.  Miles I will need your help for this one, see the TODO comments in OpenCompareEditorProvider#init.Right now I use the ReviewBehavior object to pass in the parent repository needed to resolve the file revision from the team repository and the resolution is done when the file is opened in the compare editor.  Ideally, we should add a reference to the repository in the ReviewItemSet model element and a team IFileRevision reference in the Mylyn Review IFileRevision.  This would enable use to decorate the IFileItem icon in the GErrit Task editor and Review Navigator at all times.  However, to make that work, we need a way to detect that the workspace file has changed to redo the resolution when the user changes his workspace (e.g. when checking out another git branch).  This should be investigated and done as part of the effort for bug 371428, which is the evolution of the solution provided here).We should also change the Mylyn Review IFileRevision element name to IFileVersion to avoid confusion with the team API element (see bug 403393)In any case, except for the OpenCompareEditorProvider problem, this is ready for the final review",8,11986,2013-03-14 19:42:26,2013-03-14 19:42:26,0,MERGED,17.0,597.0,4,9,11,1

9839,"Patch Set 1:Marc, could you please review this patch? The affected code is in DSF but I don't really know who else is interested in it. Maybe Randy?The fix is simple. The memory view tracks the content of the memory blocks by setting the 'HISTORY_KNOWN' flag for each byte. For some reason 'dsfMemoryBlock' sets the flag only is the byte value has changed. If the unit size is greater than 1 and only one byte in the unit has changed the remaining bytes in the unit don't have the 'HISTORY_KNOWN' flag set. As a result the entire unit is not regarded as being tracked.",1,12371,2012-07-09 17:16:30,2012-07-09 17:16:30,0,MERGED,1.0,4.0,2,6,1,0

The move to Import-Package will allow for looser coupling between plug-ins.Here is an interesting blog about this topic:http://www.vogella.com/blog/2009/03/27/required-bundle-import-package/",1,12521,2012-07-30 20:30:52,2012-07-30 20:30:52,0,MERGED,4.0,28.0,2,2,2,0

10251,Patch Set 5:Mainly cleaned up the test case and increased the performance of this test. The test contained a lot of sleeps to avoid racily clean index entries. The number of sleeps have been reduced and the test runs faster.I am more confident about this fix because I see that native git also goes the same direction to update the working tree first and the update the index (see http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/jgit-dev/msg01730.html).One leftover is still not completely clear. Are there situations where we have to rollback modified working tree files in case while updating the working tree or the index we run into exceptions (e.g. can't update a locked working tree file),5,12585,2012-07-10 10:35:13,2012-07-11 21:44:19,35,MERGED,3.0,251.0,1,2,8,1

AFAICT, the reading of the filestamp is rather unexpensive (at least compared to not reading it, and re-hashing file contents all the time ;)).if the keep() method is the wrong place, or if more care needs to be taken when to call it with zero (old behaviour) or the current file's timestamp (new behaviour) - i can't tell, but you may tell me, and i'll do my best :)currently i just can say that all unit tests go ok, and that i'm quite satisfied with how /fast/ this makes working with JGit/EGit; it really is approximately 50 times faster in most situations, and i had to wait _a lot_ before.",3,12614,2012-06-04 11:18:59,2012-06-04 11:18:59,0,MERGED,1.0,18.0,3,8,6,0

10435,"Patch Set 10:Content can't change during reading. Or at least it shouldn't. The correct way to modify the config file is to write a new copy of it to config.lock, then atomically rename config.lock to config. Anyone who edits the file in place is just asking to corrupt the file, and/or confuse a concurrent reader.But since this code is opening the file and then later stats it to find the length to estimate the read, and these are both resolving the path down to the inode separately it is possible for the file to change in length if someone renames an updated version in between the two calls.This is low level enough, and used often enough by JGit, that I want it to robustly handle the file size changing when the lock file rename protocol was followed by a concurrent writer. Otherwise servers will fall over periodically when a concurrent writer races against a reader, and the reader will eventually get caught between the two path->inode translations.Go ask Sun why the felt it wasn't necessary to be able to determine the length of an open file from a FileInputStream using the fstat() system call.

IMHO with git you can easily share patches through github/gerrit/git-servers/mail and so one.Currently, there is no way to apply a patch in JGit, see bug 361548. In EGit, the Compare Framework's Apply Patch command is used. It doesn't run smoothly with plain unified diffs which are currently generated by EGit, see bug 358527 for more info. The patch fixes the root cause and allows EGit to produce workspace-aware patches. The same thing is done for CVS.

10635,"Patch Set 3:Ok, here's Round 2.  I think I hit all of the style issues from before, and addressed the commonBase problem we discussed.  I did it in a slightly different way than your suggestion, but I think it makes a little bit more sense given how the data comes into the generator.  Let me know if you see any problems with it.The generator should now return all commits up to the specified depth, ignoring any that were part of commonBase.  But it will correctly start returning any commits below the boundary of a previous shallow checkout, and return all commits at the old boundary as UNINTERESTING so that the PackWriter can exclude the right things from the pack.  As far as I can tell, this is correct behavior in all cases.I couldn't do the SEEN thing like I was planning on doing, because uninteresting commits get the flag set on them as well (as part of markStart()), so sometimes it's already present on commits in our queue even though we haven't added all their parents yet.  I reworked the depth stuff a bit and added some comments, hopefully making it clear enough that the depth sorting accomplishes the same thing.I'm cautiously optimistic that this is getting pretty close.

I had to turn off my reorder commits logic when a shallow clone is being used, because the reordering was packing parent commits that should not have been included in the pack. Not your fault, since the code is newer than the last version you touched in the patch. :-)I think I also busted shallow clone over smart HTTP. The server always crashes with an exception during the exchange, but it works correctly. Smart HTTP clients have an extra intermediate request that the UploadPack code isn't expecting.

This might actually be completely unnecessary if I do that hash code normalization thing I was talking about in the refactor diff API change.    testMyers 10000 bytes took  491400 ns.

10852,"Patch Set 6: (5 inline comments)Regarding the latest performance improvements: that's really great and also votes for Patience diff as default diff.But one more general view on it here: Shawn last comment contained lines like:     testMyers 1280000 bytes took  21600751000 ns.

N=2560000, D=793, time/(N*D):1.49E0, time/(N*D^2):1.88E-3This tells us that Patience diff can be even faster then Myers. But even more interesting to me is the value for D (the size of the found edit-script). PatienceDiff found an 5 times lesser edits than myers. I won't say that smaller edit-scripts (with probably huger regions) are better, but my big hope is that PatienceDiff brings ""better diffs"" regarding readability by humans. We should have tests with real-world content which proof that. Tests which show better quality of the diffs as listed here: http://bramcohen.livejournal.com/73318.html",6,13292,2010-09-02 21:41:15,2010-09-04 06:55:47,33,MERGED,4.0,751.0,2,6,10,0
10853,"Patch Set 6: (5 inline comments)FWIW, I'm still not done speeding up PatienceDiff.  I think we can do even better than we are doing right now.  Some of the ideas may even be leveraged back into MyersDiff.  I just haven't thought about doing that yet because its still a big ugly black box to me.Coming up with D=793 on PatienceDiff when MyersDiff comes up with D=4210 is because we are only looking at unique common lines.  When PatienceDiff cannot find a unique line in a region, it just bails and does a giant replace, while MyersDiff continues to look for context.If we plugged in MyersDiff at this point as a fallback, we should get D=4210 again.  But I'm not sure that is the best immediate fallback strategy.  We could instead build a histogram of the common lines and pick the least duplicated common lines and try to find the LCS around those.  By using least duplicated we should still avoid nasty cases like ""\t}\n"" as being an anchor point for the matching, but would still be able to break out of the degenerate case.Thus far I have done only very limited testing of PatienceDiff on real-world input.  I did wire it into DiffFormatter and run `jgit log -p` to scan through the diffs.  I didn't see any obvious variations from MyersDiff, but I don't think recent JGit history is a poster child for where patience diff is supposed to produce more readable results.In case you didn't know, my motivation behind PatienceDiff was to find another solution to Gerrit issue 487 [1], infinite loop in MyersDiff.  Unfortunately patience diff really fails on single-character sequences (due to insufficient common unique points), but the algorithm is trivially simple and easy to prove that it will terminate.  I'm probably going to try and do a word-level variant of RawText and see if we can get a word-level thing to work better under PatienceDiff for the intraline difference coloring in Gerrit.Also, MyersDiff is really slow for Gerrit.  For some patches it takes 2.5s to display the page.  Of that 2.5s, 2.450s is spent in MyersDiff doing the intraline work.  Getting a faster algorithm under it would be nice.[1] http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=487",6,13292,2010-09-02 21:41:15,2010-09-04 06:55:47,33,MERGED,4.0,751.0,2,6,10,1

My opinion is, we're not freezing any APIs until we release 1.0.0.  Until then we may rip up APIs during a 0.x to 0.(x+1) release, so we should scope that way, and anyone linking to us should assume that same risk.Part of the problem I have though is the foundation encourages a 2 year commitment to supporting published APIs.

At the moment I would prefer this is not submitted, as although it passed the tests on the build machine, tests in SourceLookupTest (specifically sourceSubstituteChanges and sourceSubstituteAdded) now fail intermittently when I run the tests. This is because the operation has stopped being atomic by changing it from a Query to a DsfRunnable.That said, I am aware their is a tradeoff between locking the entire GUI (VERY BAD!) and a corner case of source lookup changes not working.

11544,"Patch Set 2:(1 comment)Tomek, I think you're exactly right. It looks like we've been getting false positives all along for whether reviews need to be updated or not. As far as I can tell, we'd always be updating reviews. This could explain the rather hyper-active updating we've been seeing. And yeah, we should look at the tests as they seem to be expecting one too many updates. But we need to be careful to test this change in UI as it could have significant consequences. (Note that by default, we simply returned true in all cases for model updates as that is the ""safe"" strategy -- you shouldn't be able to screw anything up by over-reporting your need for an update but you could by under-reporting it.)",2,14139,2013-10-07 10:38:40,2013-10-15 16:56:06,198,ABANDONED,5.0,253.0,5,9,2,0

11570,Patch Set 1:This seem to hurt LT proxy design. I'm not certain how to handle this change too. So lets discuss some ideas.I think it should be designed as:1. Create a new interface org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.IRemoteConnection2. Provides an implementation of IRemoteConnection for local connections (org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.LocalConnection)3. Your RDTConnection goes to package org.eclipse.linuxtools.internal.rdt.proxy. It should implement the IRemoteConnection interface too.4. The method RDTConnection#getConnectionsName goes to org.eclipse.linuxtools.internal.rdt.proxy.RDTProxyManager. Perhaps it should return a list of IRemoteConnection instead of the connections name. Notice that RDTProxyManager has already a getConnection(uri) method5. Finally create a method in org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.RemoteProxyManager to return either LocalConnection or RDTConnection based upon the URI and/or IProject.Notice that org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch has already two classes about remote connection: RemoteConnection and RemoteConnectionException. They doesn't fit in current LT proxy design but I am not sure how to deal with it... :(,1,14238,2015-10-20 18:20:45,2015-10-20 18:20:45,0,ABANDONED,12.0,292.0,3,4,3,1

11602,"Patch Set 1:This change follows up (and depends on) review 54318.The GMF Notation model has a peculiar structure in the View::element reference, which is ""unsettable"" in the EMF feature sense of supporting a separate ""unset"" state and which has a default value that is derived from the element references of the parent view chain.To support AOF bindings and other operations on such references, the AOF needs to support this ""unset"" state explicitly.  As the EMF implementation of the AOF represents all scalar features as IOnes, and as the IOne interface already provides a default value, it seemed useful to add an ""isDefault"" API to IOne in order to let clients know when the box's value is defaulted.  The EMF implementation of the IOne for scalar features takes account of the unset state and exposes it in this new API.  The One class and its delegate likewise provide the default state for other domains.New JUnit tests are included for simple scenarios in the EMF domain and the core AOF.",1,14414,2015-08-26 03:45:56,2015-08-26 03:45:56,0,ABANDONED,21.0,1177.0,3,5,2,0

If this was done to give dirty editors chance to save their content - this doesn't work either, because first of all user denied once that he won't save it and second because the editor immediately recognize that resource is gone and simply stops to render the content and shows ""file does not exist"" error.The good news: with https://git.eclipse.org/r/41675 patch dirty editors of closed project will be closed too.Not so good news: this works only for projects closed with the ""standard"" CloseResourceAction - all other ""closing"" possibilities (custom actions or direct API use) will still not close the editor.So I think this change still makes sense.",3,14765,2015-02-10 21:46:15,2015-02-11 05:54:05,8,ABANDONED,1.0,7.0,4,8,3,1

A hook (for example, post-commit) could very well checkout another branch, copy create a copy of the commit there, then re-checkout the original branch. On the other hand, CommitBuilder shouldn't be used without having locked the repo beforehand IIUC.Likewise, the pre-commit hook can ""block"" a commit entirely, which wouldn't be possible without some hickups if done too low-level : the CommitCommand, RebaseCommand, CherrypickCommand... or anything called by EGit might setup some preparation on the repository before calling the lower level ObjectInserter... but if the hook rejects the commit, all of this setup is not only useless but needs to be reverted.I'll try and pull them down a few level if you think that's necessary, but I don't really know how to do it cleanly.",3,14794,2014-10-31 14:20:14,2014-11-03 09:32:07,67,ABANDONED,6.0,78.0,3,5,9,1

Why not in this case?  Or are we free now to introduce more POM hierarchy for other purposes?  That would be fine with me; I just thought that was not currently policy.  Also, I'm concerned that we're adding POM files that aren't maintained within the Eclipse projects and are therefore not easily managed within the Eclipse environment (they are only accessible in the Git directories).

AFAIK, we don't use these in Papyrus.  And all of the files that are changed in plug-ins that aren't generated?What I was hoping to see was common infrastructure that I could re-use in my own Xtend projects to simplify their build configuration (which, granted, isn't exactly complex:  the xtend-maven-plugin is quite simple).  I don't see much of a common infrastructure here that I can understand, or it's hard to find in the large number of changes.  I can't review this until it's cleaned up.",2,14881,2014-11-07 12:22:20,2014-11-14 17:14:26,172,ABANDONED,1049.0,266111.0,4,11,2,1
11693,"Patch Set 2:(In reply to comment #11)> Patch Set 2:> > About the current review don't forget that its on a branch and that a squashing> (reorder/merge...) phase is expected before merging in masterYes, but most of the files changed here would not want to be merged to master because they have nothing to do with integrating any kind of code generation into the build system.  So, the merge to master must not include those changes, so best not to implement them on the branch in the first place.

Is there a wiki page referencing official collegiate decisions ? )Not that I know of.  There's just the pattern established when Tycho was first implemented in Papyrus and some discussions on the mailing list and conference calls that I remember (or perhaps misremember).  Anyways, I certainly don't object to changing the module structure if it can help improve matters, but it would be nice to see any changes implemented consistently throughout the repository.> Indeed all pom.xml are currently on the same level as a .project file, but I> believe that we should change that.> - you can change the pom.xml with eclipse directly in the git repository view.Yes, that's a good point.

These POMs need to be better modularized, and not just because of the number of times I've had to manually merge them because they're a central locus of change!  The same can be said for the JUnit AllTests suite (I've actually implemented something on my branch to help modularize that one).> *****On a more practical view, this is what I suggest : *******> - create independent bugs for each generation typeAgreed.> - create a bug for publishing good website from each plugins with maven/tychoI'll be interested to see what the enhancement bugzilla says about the motivation for this.> - create a bug for the structure of pom.xmlAgreed.> - push gerrit contribution to MASTER that will be reviewed by everyoneAgreed.> (especially you :))Yes, I can volunteer. :-)> - treat the subjects in this order : xtend, emf, site, mw2Why would mwe2 not be a higher priority than the site?

I think we should easily be able to get this incorporated into ECF 3.9.1.A few very minor comments:1) For the ScpBrowseFileTransferFactory class:  Is there any need to have this class be in a new (and exported) package org.eclipse.ecf.provider.filetransfer.scp?  Unless you already know that this class is going to be accessed by some other bundle, I would prefer that it be placed in the existing internal package:  org.eclipse.ecf.internal.provider.scp.  That way, the scp provider code would all be exposed by internal-only packages...and this browse edition would be consistent with the retrieve and send classes (which are in the internal package now).2) If you move the ScpBrowseFileTransferFactory class into the internal package, it would make it unnecessary to export a new package in the manifest.mf.  For maintenance, it would be nice for us to continue to not export any non-internal packages.I can make the following changes if you wish...just wanted to include them in public review:3) The Bundle-Version in the manifest should be updated from 2.0.100.qualifier to 2.1.0.qualifier (minor revision because of new functionality).4) In org.eclipse.ecf.internal.provider.filetransfer.scp.ScpFileSystemBrowser there are a couple of commented lines:		// FIXME - This code is from ScpOutgoingFileTransfer, but it throws		// exceptions		// if (scpUtil != null) {		// scpUtil.sendZeroToStream(outputStream);		// scpUtil.checkAck(inputStream);		// }Probably best just to remove these lines...unless they are needed for the browse.But overall things look great.  I will fix 3 and 4 prior to commit if you prefer.

However, in my opinion we should delay this patch to RMF 0.9.0, because:(1) the patch using JUnitBenchmarks requires at least junit 4.9. However, the current RMF target platform includes version 4.8.2 (which is part of the Eclipse JDT v.3.7.2). Plese note: Our current build is still based on eclipse 3.7 (indigo). Nevertheless, the orbit update site includes junit 4.10, which could be used as well.@ Fran├ºois: Do you use the RMF indigo target development definition?(2) Our plan is to build RMF 0.9.0 on top of Kepler. The Kepler update site includes a newer version of JDT as well as a newer version of Junit.(3) I guess, that the JUnitBenchmark library is not part of the Eclipse Orbit Project. As a consequence, we need a CQ for the library, especially for the customized version for working with OSGI. I think this should be no problem, since the library is only for testing/benchmark purposes.I will create a new bug entry covering this discussion.",1,15113,2013-07-30 14:30:37,2013-07-30 14:33:05,0,ABANDONED,5.0,28.0,2,2,1,0

Wim, no my extension point can not be used like this, as he adds a tab the the overall edtitor, while the vertical extention point adds it to the single elements in the tree.(+) I think it is very interesting, and provides means to solve a few problems. I also like the possiblity to have a list instead of the tree.(-)It breaks with the consistent Eclipse usage one is used to. That is, e.g. the feature to mark duplicate ids should be embedded more Eclipse style s.t. it integrates into the problems view etc. I like the feature to jump to the entries in the tree and the source, again, this should be solved the eclipse way. Repair and Mark should be applicable to the tree.The argument requirement org.eclipse.e4.tools.modeleditor.utilitytab.enabled is a no go.I like the patch, I don't like that it breaks with the way one is used to use Eclipse and I think the functionality embedded should be integrated in other ways.

We could build a command infrastructure, but that's what EMF edit is for. But it's too ambitious to put in edit support yet.2.

11932,"Patch Set 1:The pack is normally closed when the last window to it is evicted from the WindowCache.This eviction occurs one of two ways:The first is by the weak LRU popping the least-recently-used window in order to release resources to keep the cache under the byte or open file limits. As these windows are popped the open window count on PackFile gets decreased, and the file is closed when the count drops to 0.The second is when WindowCache spins the ReferenceQueue. If the JVM GC killed some of our SoftReferences in order to free up heap memory WindowCache will (eventually) spin those now dead references out and decrement the open window count on the associated PackFile. When the count drops to 0, the file is closed.I just made a patch to C Git today that doesn't keep the file open if there is exactly 1 window on it. This might be useful in JGit too, but less so because the default window size is so much smaller (8 Kib in JGit).

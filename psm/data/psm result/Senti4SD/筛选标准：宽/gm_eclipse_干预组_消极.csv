311,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2 Verified+1Thanks for the contribution, Fred!  Even paying attention to copyright statements.This change certainly cuts neatly through a bunch of unnecessary and wonky code.  I was going to complain that changing the APIs in the UI classes from working with URIs to working with IResources results in a loss of generality, so that it would be more difficult to support exporting diagrams to the host filesystem (which is desperately needed, IMO) or other destinations, and that IResource is not even as appropriate a type as IContainer, but then I observed that the entire export infrastructure beneath the UI is all pinned to the IResource contract, anyways.  That, combined with the fact that any clients trying to use these UI bits would have had to construct nonsense URIs, means that I don't mind that this technically is an API-breaking change because that API was already non-functional and it will have to break again some time anyways to support exporting to non-workspace destinations.  Besides that none of these UI classes should ever have been exposed as API to begin with.All of which is to say thanks for working through the contribution process and do come back for more.",1,970,2016-10-13 21:08:40,2016-10-13 21:08:40,0,MERGED,5.0,118.0,4,5,1,negative

1913,"Patch Set 4:> Wow - this was really close. I tested this on Windows and already > typed in my +2 message. Only picking up one cup of coffee saved us > from accidentily submitting thisI still think this fix is the right thing to do, not closing resource is never a good idea but this change is defeating the RepositoryCache creator original intent, which I think was to keep stuff around as long as possible by using SoftReference.I tested this series and so far the memory consumption drastically improved because the RepositoryCache is no longer slowly growing but I can see that the disk IO increased and performance degraded in operations involving many repositories, like listing projects in Gerrit (ls-projects command).Relying on the SoftReference mechanism to evict old unused repository is not a good idea because the eviction becomes unpredictable. For example, our Gerrit master JVM heap is set to 58GB, the old generation space(Tenured Generation) is 44GB which leaves 14GB for the eden and survivor spaces. The old generation space eventually becomes full (mostly by the caches including the unbound RepositoryCache) and then the application starts slowing down because GC keeps kicking in. The SoftReference are still not being collected at that point because the buffer of available memory is not bellow the threshold that would make GC consider the SoftReference.All this to say that I will do more testing on our production server but if it turns out that the performance impact is too big, I(we) will need to consider reimplementing the RepositoryCache to achieve the goal of keeping repository in memory but without being forever (I am not sure yet what would be the eviction criteria).",4,3100,2015-09-04 19:32:28,2015-09-18 19:27:35,335,MERGED,3.0,30.0,3,7,6,negative

This fixes my most serious concern in regard to honoring the IProgressConstants2.SHOW_IN_TASKBAR_ICON_PROPERTY flag.(b) I can confirm that the system task bar is *not* yet triggered during the RCP startup process, there exists two reasons for this:(b.1) Previous 3.x Workbench code did enter in WorkbenchAdvisor.openWindows() a different code branch, because the lineIStatus status = myConfigurer[0].restoreState();could give a not-OK-status, this is no longer possible, because now WorkbenchConfigurer.restoreState() *always* returns OK_STATUS.(b.2) Now Workbench.createAndRunWorkbench does not wrap the splash handlers progress monitor using TaskBarDelegatingProgressMonitor.(b.3) My test program omits to set SHOW_PROGRESS_ON_STARTUP=true in the plugin_customization.iniTherefore my action items for this week end are:- Upload an improved test program that ensures that the startup presents progress on startup- Try to fix the second unwrapped progress monitorMy most serious concerns for this issue are fixing to honor IProgressConstants2.SHOW_IN_TASKBAR_ICON_PROPERTY.

I get very strange things and follow-up errors if I edit a link in the compare editor and make it invalid in doing so.And I didn't even try to do really bad things, like setting the link content to multiple lines of text.In particular:0. Start off with a valid link in the workspace, pointing to another file in the workspace. (Link created with ln -s in shell, committed in shell, then pulled in EGit.)1. Select ""Context menu->Compare with index"" and edit the workspace link's contents (append a zero to make it invalid -- assuming there is no such file). Save.2. Link is shown in staging view as deleted. cgit git status reports it as modified.3. Stage and commit the broken link in EGit. 4. On disk, the broken link is still there! No error logged. Compare editor remains open. cgit reports the broken link suddenly as untracked.5. Do a ""Reset Hard"" on the parent commit. Now the valid link does not re-appear in package explorer. Even worse, it's gone on disk! cgit git status reports it as a staged deletion, and so does EGit's staging view. If I do the hard reset instead using cgit, the link is restored fine. Looks like EGit/JGit cannot restore a valid link if the workspace contains a broken link in that place.Other case:0: Start off with a valid top-level valid link (top-level is not in workspace) pointing to a file inside a project.1. On disk, break the link by doing ln -s doesntexist.txt link.txt2. In Eclipse, refresh staging view.2. Link is shown in git staging view as unstaged modification. Agrees with cgit.3. Stage and commit.4. In Eclipse, do a Reset hard on the parent commit (with the valid link).

3065,"Patch Set 4:(1 comment)Gabor, the latest patches of JDT Core and UI seem to be working quite well at a first glance. I am yet to test the feature properly. Before that, please have a look at the following as well:- It is not working for type names, e.g. when you type a substring of a class name to declare a field.- The relevance / proposal order is mixed up when fields are proposed with types. Example:public class C {	int intField;	String stringField;	{		field|	}}- In case of methods, the substring is also matched in its parameters, return type, declaring type etc. I think it should be restricted to only the method name.- Filtering of the results still seems to have some issue. Not sure if the filtered results look confusing or non-relevant due to the above issue of not restricting the match to just the name or if it is due to the non-subsequent matching. We can check that once the above issue is fixed. Also, pattern highlighting in the proposal will be very useful with this feature. Please check if it is simple to implement. Otherwise, we can do that later.",4,4800,2015-07-14 13:11:53,2015-07-27 12:12:26,311,MERGED,4.0,62.0,3,5,15,negative

I suppose, the names were chosen before support for camel case matching was added. For now, I have updated Javadoc to reflect how validation is done but have not touched the method names since that change would affect subclasses as well. However, I consider that renaming these methods to isValidToken() and isMatching() is something similar would make their roles more clear to future contributors.",12,4800,2015-07-14 13:11:53,2015-08-21 20:24:31,919,MERGED,4.0,62.0,3,5,15,negative

It's the branch that always points to the latest release. The Git master branch does not have this semantic.Also my guess is that in most cases, when users want to convert their repository to Gitflow, it would make more sense to turn the existing master into develop (e.g. the EGit repository).",4,5398,2015-08-28 21:44:57,2015-09-09 22:53:08,289,MERGED,10.0,386.0,3,6,6,negative

This means that previously there would be an error reported to the user but it would now lead to an uncaught RuntimeException.If we wanted to not wrap in RuntimeException, basically every method that does not implement an existing API would need to throw SnapshotException since implementing code may want to call another method that does.

It doesn't differentiate between the differentiterators and blindly computes id's for the content unless it findsdifferent ids. If the treewalk happens to have a FileSystem basedWorkingTreeIterator included this means that you will have to readnearly every single File in the working tree and compute it's content SHA1to do the merge. ANY_DIFF has no idea that there may be a DirCacheIteratoralso in the TreeWalk which already contains the SHA1 of the non-dirtyworkingtree files. ANY_DIFF will always compute the SHA1 again. Onlyexception: if ANY_DIFF detects already a difference between e.g.OURS and THEIRS then it knows early that there is a diff and canskip calculating SHA1's for filesystem content.If we manually do the detection of diffs in an unfiltered treewalkwe can be much faster. Look at ResolveMerger.processEntry() to lookat all the cheap shortcuts we can use. E.g. if the index is dirty(somebody added something for that path) we can let the merge fail becauseof that.If OURS, THEIRS, BASE don't contain anything for that path we knowit's only index and working tree which may contain something for thefile - no need to process this path during the merge. If OURSis equal to BASE then the merge result is clear: It must be in THEIRS.All these are decisions we can take and completely ignoring whatsin the expensive working tree.Long talk - but here comes real world performance measurements showinghow this change compares performance wise to it's predecessor commit.

4511,"Patch Set 5: Verified+1 Code-Review-1(2 comments)Hi Mickael,I tested the latest patch. In general it works very well. The only thing that I think could be changed at this moment is described by the following scenario:Create 3 projects (p1, p2, p3) and 2 working sets (w1 and w2). Then assign p1 and p2 to w1; p2 and p3 to w2.Next, try to DnD p1 and p2 (together) from w1 to w2. The result is that p1 is moved to w2, but p2 is not removed from w1.In Package Explorer this operation is not allowed (i.e. moving a group of projects which contain some projects that are already in the target working set).I think that for now we should keep the same behavior in both explorers.I also took a quick look at the code.

The contribution is the path to the cross compiler you specify in your project settings. Normally that path is prepended. It normally works fine, unless you use say ${ARM_TOOL_PATH} which java.io.File does not understand. It assumes ${ARM_TOOL_PATH} is some form of weird folder name in cwd and hence prepends c:\program files\...\eclipse\bin resulting in a non-existing directory being added to the path.

It doesn't matter what the defaults were when the perspective was created, only that the perspective remember what actionSets are active at the moment.This is still true, but ActionSetManager (and also no one else) never persisted the ""disabled"" action sets as user choice. So you could request to show/hide them (depending on the application needs), but once user decides to get rid of some action set, this decision must ""override"" application choice. The best example is the debug action sett with the global debug buttons. In the old implementation you could try to ""hide"" them - but on next restart they will come back again, or, even worse, as soon as you hit a breakpoint - and this mean they will be back in a minute.

5616,"Patch Set 8:(3 comments)> If I create a new snippet (Either through the ""Create Snippet"" context menu or through ""Add"" in the Snippets view) the snippet doesn't start out as needing to be saved (the little * symbol).Hi Andreas,I am not sure if this is a bug. I think this is the normal behavior of an editor. For example, if you create a new Java class in your IDE, the java editor won't pop-up and expect you to save the class before making any modifications to it.I think the snippet editor should not do this either.And you are right, the data-binding framework and the form editor framework are both tracking changes in the view/model. If we use only the form editor framework, we'll have to update the model by hand. (See the in-line comments)Also, I just realized that I might have made a mistake when using the data binding framework. This will update the model whenever changes occur in the editor, but we need to update it only when the save action takes place (i.e. in the commit method of the form parts). Although this is not visible as it only updates the in-memory model, not the actual json file, I think we still should avoid it. So this would be another +1 for not using the data binding framework.",8,8960,2014-06-12 19:10:02,2014-08-13 08:54:17,1477,MERGED,20.0,743.0,3,14,18,negative

Not all results may have been displayed.)The filter can still search while the index job is running.  It starts a search job.  Clearing the cache cancels that job.  The search finds all items by default without typing, so it was most likely running when you cleared the cache.  See the progress view to verify there are 2 jobs running.I like having results in the table immediately, and that is why the search starts before typing anything.

See final comment on provider status callback. This is a very narrow scoped feature with much overhead.  I can't see initializing on startup, or even when the dialog first opens.  It should only happen on first use.  The provider chooses to to initialize, and the GUI has no idea this is even taking place.  The current filter/provider mechanism has no callbacks regarding initialization (only a clear cache method).   This leaves us with 2 choices:  Go back to the modal dialog with cancel option, or create a provider status callback mechanism.  I am leaning towards the thought that if you can't use the filter while the provider is initializing, there is no harm in the modal dialog.

Am I right in this?    The TaskReference is gone from the Review, but is still in the ReviewGroup.  I am a little confused by this.

Those are FileItem, FileVersion and ReviewItemSet	addedBy (apply to all)	committedBy  (apply to all)	name  (apply to all)	id  (apply to all)	reference  (apply to all)	set (only for FileItems (that is, whatever the real base review item is)So we could move set to FileItem but otherwise I think the abstraction is useful.> I saw that you introduced a Change element as a Review superclass.  What is> the rationale behind this?  Can't all the info be in a single Review EClass?I isolated Change because it supports those changes that don't have an associated review. And it's also a practical thing because we want to be able to create one-off parent and children changes attached to reviews. These aren't actually changes per se, they're (in Gerrit) simply git references. I think this distinction is useful beyond Gerrit as you're likely to want to have change references that allow you to see the dependency tree..?> Also, I noticed that review now> has Change parents and childrens elements.

9090,"Patch Set 8:The code was adapted to work with the new Remotes API that was just merged in.  Basically the functionality is as before and is tested (except for comparing review items which I could not test due to new bug 403389).There is one part missing to resolve the File Revisions when opening a file from the Review Navigator.  Miles I will need your help for this one, see the TODO comments in OpenCompareEditorProvider#init.Right now I use the ReviewBehavior object to pass in the parent repository needed to resolve the file revision from the team repository and the resolution is done when the file is opened in the compare editor.  Ideally, we should add a reference to the repository in the ReviewItemSet model element and a team IFileRevision reference in the Mylyn Review IFileRevision.  This would enable use to decorate the IFileItem icon in the GErrit Task editor and Review Navigator at all times.  However, to make that work, we need a way to detect that the workspace file has changed to redo the resolution when the user changes his workspace (e.g. when checking out another git branch).  This should be investigated and done as part of the effort for bug 371428, which is the evolution of the solution provided here).We should also change the Mylyn Review IFileRevision element name to IFileVersion to avoid confusion with the team API element (see bug 403393)In any case, except for the OpenCompareEditorProvider problem, this is ready for the final review",8,11986,2013-03-14 19:42:26,2013-03-14 19:42:26,0,MERGED,17.0,597.0,4,9,11,negative

Otherwise servers will fall over periodically when a concurrent writer races against a reader, and the reader will eventually get caught between the two path->inode translations.Go ask Sun why the felt it wasn't necessary to be able to determine the length of an open file from a FileInputStream using the fstat() system call.

10853,"Patch Set 6: (5 inline comments)FWIW, I'm still not done speeding up PatienceDiff.  I think we can do even better than we are doing right now.  Some of the ideas may even be leveraged back into MyersDiff.  I just haven't thought about doing that yet because its still a big ugly black box to me.Coming up with D=793 on PatienceDiff when MyersDiff comes up with D=4210 is because we are only looking at unique common lines.  When PatienceDiff cannot find a unique line in a region, it just bails and does a giant replace, while MyersDiff continues to look for context.If we plugged in MyersDiff at this point as a fallback, we should get D=4210 again.  But I'm not sure that is the best immediate fallback strategy.  We could instead build a histogram of the common lines and pick the least duplicated common lines and try to find the LCS around those.  By using least duplicated we should still avoid nasty cases like ""\t}\n"" as being an anchor point for the matching, but would still be able to break out of the degenerate case.Thus far I have done only very limited testing of PatienceDiff on real-world input.  I did wire it into DiffFormatter and run `jgit log -p` to scan through the diffs.  I didn't see any obvious variations from MyersDiff, but I don't think recent JGit history is a poster child for where patience diff is supposed to produce more readable results.In case you didn't know, my motivation behind PatienceDiff was to find another solution to Gerrit issue 487 [1], infinite loop in MyersDiff.  Unfortunately patience diff really fails on single-character sequences (due to insufficient common unique points), but the algorithm is trivially simple and easy to prove that it will terminate.  I'm probably going to try and do a word-level variant of RawText and see if we can get a word-level thing to work better under PatienceDiff for the intraline difference coloring in Gerrit.Also, MyersDiff is really slow for Gerrit.  For some patches it takes 2.5s to display the page.  Of that 2.5s, 2.450s is spent in MyersDiff doing the intraline work.  Getting a faster algorithm under it would be nice.[1] http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=487",6,13292,2010-09-02 21:41:15,2010-09-04 06:55:47,33,MERGED,4.0,751.0,2,6,10,negative

11570,Patch Set 1:This seem to hurt LT proxy design. I'm not certain how to handle this change too. So lets discuss some ideas.I think it should be designed as:1. Create a new interface org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.IRemoteConnection2. Provides an implementation of IRemoteConnection for local connections (org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.LocalConnection)3. Your RDTConnection goes to package org.eclipse.linuxtools.internal.rdt.proxy. It should implement the IRemoteConnection interface too.4. The method RDTConnection#getConnectionsName goes to org.eclipse.linuxtools.internal.rdt.proxy.RDTProxyManager. Perhaps it should return a list of IRemoteConnection instead of the connections name. Notice that RDTProxyManager has already a getConnection(uri) method5. Finally create a method in org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.RemoteProxyManager to return either LocalConnection or RDTConnection based upon the URI and/or IProject.Notice that org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch has already two classes about remote connection: RemoteConnection and RemoteConnectionException. They doesn't fit in current LT proxy design but I am not sure how to deal with it... :(,1,14238,2015-10-20 18:20:45,2015-10-20 18:20:45,0,ABANDONED,12.0,292.0,3,4,3,negative

A hook (for example, post-commit) could very well checkout another branch, copy create a copy of the commit there, then re-checkout the original branch. On the other hand, CommitBuilder shouldn't be used without having locked the repo beforehand IIUC.Likewise, the pre-commit hook can ""block"" a commit entirely, which wouldn't be possible without some hickups if done too low-level : the CommitCommand, RebaseCommand, CherrypickCommand... or anything called by EGit might setup some preparation on the repository before calling the lower level ObjectInserter... but if the hook rejects the commit, all of this setup is not only useless but needs to be reverted.I'll try and pull them down a few level if you think that's necessary, but I don't really know how to do it cleanly.",3,14794,2014-10-31 14:20:14,2014-11-03 09:32:07,67,ABANDONED,6.0,78.0,3,5,9,negative

Why not in this case?  Or are we free now to introduce more POM hierarchy for other purposes?  That would be fine with me; I just thought that was not currently policy.

As these windows are popped the open window count on PackFile gets decreased, and the file is closed when the count drops to 0.The second is when WindowCache spins the ReferenceQueue. If the JVM GC killed some of our SoftReferences in order to free up heap memory WindowCache will (eventually) spin those now dead references out and decrement the open window count on the associated PackFile. When the count drops to 0, the file is closed.I just made a patch to C Git today that doesn't keep the file open if there is exactly 1 window on it.

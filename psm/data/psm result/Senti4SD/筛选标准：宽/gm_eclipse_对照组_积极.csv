1696,"Patch Set 13:> OK, so what was presented at the meeting had ""Views"" first. So I better understand why Bernd is now surprised that Views comes last in the list.> So I guess keeping lexicographical order was not discussed at that meeting then, perhaps this aspect was overlooked.1- Gerrit please don't reformat this!2- It was discussed, and the thought was it should be like photoshop/code block/qt creator/audacity/eclipse's plugins menu: external stuff below the built-in. We actually wondered if out of alphabetical order was going to make the users experience off and concluded that changing the convention set up by many other applications would be far worse.3- Notice the question mark next to views? that was there in the wiki, we didn't come to a conclusion on that point. It was more of a ""We can't think of anything better, let's put this here then update it"" item.4- The main conclusion (according to my memory) was the #2 was the proposal to take. We moved on to other topics after, we did not spend 3 hours on this one point.I think the amount of responses though is good, it shows that we all care about the users getting the best trace analysis experience possible. Tomorrow we shall discuss this and come to a reasonable understanding, I am certainAlso, memory is malleable, I think we need to take better minutes for all that is user facing.

It's only at 3 now, but others could be added in the future.* Changing the name to continue respecting alphabetical ordering may work now, but again, new elements may be added, like ""Aweseome stuff"", and will end up sorted first.* Internationalization may change the names completely.I'm open to do some tweaks, but we have to be very careful with this, and be sure that ""putting Views first"" is more important than all the points above.",13,2818,2016-02-23 02:00:19,2016-04-27 21:57:48,1555,MERGED,10.0,365.0,8,15,13,positive

6664,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1Hi,thanks for contributing via Gerrit. I know about the contribution in the ticket itself, but I didn't had time to dig into this in more detail.Some things about your contribution:1. It seems you have the trailing whitespace issue. Looking at the ScrollBarHandlerTemplate there seem to be more changes marked as there are really. Could you please try to solve that so checking the changes is easier?2. This change may break backwards compatibility in case the ActiveCellEditorRegistry was used outside NatTable to perform modifications inside. Like exchanging the data or deleting a current selected value (e.g. https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=425176)Although the intention about the change is correct, I would like to keep the AbstractCellEditorRegistry for backwards compatibility. But it should be marked as deprecated, pointing to the new instance and telling about the issue when using it further. So users who will update won't get compile errors immediatelly.3. ScrollBarHandlerTemplateAlthough I'm not quite sure how to solve it better, I don't like the solution so far. The first thing is the instanceof check that seems to be not necessary. I thought you wanted to get rid of it?The second thing is that this change might not be compatible with the split viewport feature that was added lately. If you check the _703_HorizontalSplitViewportExample you will see that the sliders will be created by using the parent composite of the NatTable instance and are then added later on. So in case of split viewports, your change will break functionality.",1,10320,2014-01-13 13:15:12,2014-01-20 22:46:04,177,MERGED,11.0,656.0,2,3,8,positive

7223,"Patch Set 1: Verified+1 IP-Clean+1A couple of questions and comments.1) With the IServiceInfoFactory registration via DS...means that DS is required by remote service admin.   (serviceInfoFactory.xml).  Is that right?   I don't have any fundamental objections...but it does mean more/new requirement for ECF RSA.2) In AbstractTopologyManager there's member variable:┬╗	private final IServiceInfoFactory serviceInfoFactory = new ServiceInfoFactory();	This instance binding is probably undesirable...i.e. should probably use either DS or ServiceTracker so that alternative IServiceInfoFactory implementers could be used.  What I was doing previously was setting the priority of ServiceInfoFactory registration to lowest possible...Integer.MIN_INTEGER or something...so that any other IServiceInfoFactory registration would take priority.3) In the previous code (for accessing the IEndpointDescriptionAdvertiser service) there's doPriveleged block...i.e.	IEndpointDescriptionAdvertiser advertiser = AccessController		             .doPrivileged(new PrivilegedAction<IEndpointDescriptionAdvertiser>() {		This was put in place because of need to run under security manager for CT tests.  I'm not sure whether a doPrivileged block will be needed for IServiceInfoFactory lookup (once it's there)...but it may be...to avoid breaking the CT tests.4) This should be tested against the CT (and other ECF tests) before completing/merging into master...as there may be other regressions that would appear with the current CT tests (i.e. in addition to the possible security issues)5) In AbstractTopologyManager.advertiseEndpointDescription there previously was a trace line...it would probably be useful to add a trace to the new code for these methods.6) In AbstractTopologyManager.advertiseEndpointDescription...if the IServiceInfo is null, is this a warning or error condition?

I did it in a slightly different way than your suggestion, but I think it makes a little bit more sense given how the data comes into the generator.  Let me know if you see any problems with it.The generator should now return all commits up to the specified depth, ignoring any that were part of commonBase.  But it will correctly start returning any commits below the boundary of a previous shallow checkout, and return all commits at the old boundary as UNINTERESTING so that the PackWriter can exclude the right things from the pack.  As far as I can tell, this is correct behavior in all cases.I couldn't do the SEEN thing like I was planning on doing, because uninteresting commits get the flag set on them as well (as part of markStart()), so sometimes it's already present on commits in our queue even though we haven't added all their parents yet.  I reworked the depth stuff a bit and added some comments, hopefully making it clear enough that the depth sorting accomplishes the same thing.I'm cautiously optimistic that this is getting pretty close.

And yeah, we should look at the tests as they seem to be expecting one too many updates. But we need to be careful to test this change in UI as it could have significant consequences.

As the EMF implementation of the AOF represents all scalar features as IOnes, and as the IOne interface already provides a default value, it seemed useful to add an ""isDefault"" API to IOne in order to let clients know when the box's value is defaulted.

Such cases include finding loopback in Pcap Trace (IPV4/SourceAddress == IPV4/DestinationAddress).This is mostly useful for Pcap, as it essentially gives us as many filtering possibility as Wireshark.The usefulness of adding such a feature to CONTAINS and COMPARE filters is still TBD.",1,14713,2014-06-27 22:31:01,2014-06-27 22:39:50,0,ABANDONED,9.0,144.0,4,8,1,positive

If yes, then we should use a unified way to provide help across all the views, dialogs, wizards instead of adding view specific help buttons. Eclipse provides an extension point for that to define context sensitive help which can be opened from a view, dialog, wizard etc. The context sensitive help opens the relevant chapters in the User Guide.

11725,"Patch Set 1:Hi J Langley,First, thanks for the contribution!   Your patch looks excellent.  I think we should easily be able to get this incorporated into ECF 3.9.1.A few very minor comments:1) For the ScpBrowseFileTransferFactory class:  Is there any need to have this class be in a new (and exported) package org.eclipse.ecf.provider.filetransfer.scp?  Unless you already know that this class is going to be accessed by some other bundle, I would prefer that it be placed in the existing internal package:  org.eclipse.ecf.internal.provider.scp.  That way, the scp provider code would all be exposed by internal-only packages...and this browse edition would be consistent with the retrieve and send classes (which are in the internal package now).2) If you move the ScpBrowseFileTransferFactory class into the internal package, it would make it unnecessary to export a new package in the manifest.mf.  For maintenance, it would be nice for us to continue to not export any non-internal packages.I can make the following changes if you wish...just wanted to include them in public review:3) The Bundle-Version in the manifest should be updated from 2.0.100.qualifier to 2.1.0.qualifier (minor revision because of new functionality).4) In org.eclipse.ecf.internal.provider.filetransfer.scp.ScpFileSystemBrowser there are a couple of commented lines:		// FIXME - This code is from ScpOutgoingFileTransfer, but it throws		// exceptions		// if (scpUtil != null) {		// scpUtil.sendZeroToStream(outputStream);		// scpUtil.checkAck(inputStream);		// }Probably best just to remove these lines...unless they are needed for the browse.But overall things look great.  I will fix 3 and 4 prior to commit if you prefer.  If you could address 1/2...or just let me know that there is a good reason for creating/exporting a new package for this class...then I will approve, get things published, submitted and built/tested via the ECF builder for deployment.

The JUnitBenchmark library looks very interesting at a first glance. However, in my opinion we should delay this patch to RMF 0.9.0, because:(1) the patch using JUnitBenchmarks requires at least junit 4.9. However, the current RMF target platform includes version 4.8.2 (which is part of the Eclipse JDT v.3.7.2). Plese note: Our current build is still based on eclipse 3.7 (indigo). Nevertheless, the orbit update site includes junit 4.10, which could be used as well.@ Fran├ºois: Do you use the RMF indigo target development definition?(2) Our plan is to build RMF 0.9.0 on top of Kepler. The Kepler update site includes a newer version of JDT as well as a newer version of Junit.(3) I guess, that the JUnitBenchmark library is not part of the Eclipse Orbit Project.

11897,"Patch Set 1:A few comments:1)  It would be good if you include the mdeol generated code files in the commit to review2)  For all the additions to the model I have no problems3)  However I am concerned about the changed elements:	- ReviewItem <-> Item	- user -> author in the Comment element.		I have concerns because changing these in the frame.core might break compatibility in R4E between serialized model files using the old model versions with the new R4E application code.  Since only R4E uses persistent model data, we should try to minimize those changes, especially when it's only a matter of having very similar component/elements names.",1,15639,2012-09-20 00:34:04,2012-09-20 00:34:04,0,ABANDONED,1.0,164.0,4,17,1,positive
11899,"Patch Set 1:Ok then we can proceed like that then.  However if we do that, it would be good that all the non-compatible changes are concentrated into 1 R4E release, so that we can handle the transition efficiently.I'm not putting +1 on this now, as I believe this review should be abandoned and a new one created that will merge to a specific branch (i.e. not master).

11900,"Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approveLooks good in general:comments:1) reference from ReviewItem to Topic i.e. -> ""topics"" needs to be transient to avoid a change to the Review resource for every topic being created, this will minimize user contention and decease the possibility of user lockings.  This field will need to be populated within the de-serialization process.2) ""creationDate"" under Comment, R4E extended model uses ""createdOn"".      can we continue using ""createdOn"" in order to minimize serialization changes.     3) Comment#replies, seems redundant with ""comments"" besides ""replies"" is marked as containment which can cause collisions with the R4E extended model as Comments are contained at the user level.

We could still add a context menu in the Repositories View to quickly open this preference page (without having to click Window > Preferenes > Team > Git > Configuration > Select Repository), but in general I think that this would be the right place to add this UI.It shouldn't be a big deal to add this third tab to the Preferences page (something like ""Repository setting"" next to ""User setting"" and ""System setting"").Unfortnuately, we don't have any semantics on these pages (yet), so the next step may be to improve the dialog shown after clicking the ""New Entry..."" button with some help regarding keys and values to assist users with the task of setting configuration values.",2,15805,2011-02-01 22:57:29,2011-02-02 22:25:43,23,ABANDONED,4.0,164.0,3,9,2,positive

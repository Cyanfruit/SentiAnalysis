Calling any document content related functions for > the unallocated column clearly must not happen.Hi EikeThanks a lot for the review. Just to clarify regarding the nCol != -1 check, we need to let methods like Reset(), SetPatternArea(), ApplyStyleArea() to be called for the aNextColAttrArray but *without* changing any document content. An alternative to nCol != -1 checks is that we can have a default parameter or data member called bUnallocated with default value = false for all such methods and use that instead of (nCol != -1) when calling from aNextColAttrArray. Would that be better at least in terms of readability of the code ?In the meantime I will fix the other issues as per your comments.

256,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2Yes, the code that makes a selection by indices looks unreachable to me. dbaccess seems to assume that ""by bookmark"" and ""by indices"" are two possibilities and to pass a selection along with a boolean flag to document which one it is. I'm not sure of the reasons for that, or if it is just historical cruft that has no reason to be anymore.I thought about just converting this (potentially unreachable) case to bookmarks, but getting the n_th row's bookmark is not immediately obvious... It requires moving the seek cursor (which can muck with expectations of other code about where the cursor is...).

If formula which are used for calculating Default Column Width will be wrong, the tests case will fail.Please try it by your own.

And the cause is this: Take a look at SvxULSpaceItem::QueryValue and SvxULSpaceItem::PutValue. Both have nMemberId argument. If it's 0, the value is read/write without conversion, but if it's CONVERT_TWIPS then the value is converted from/to 1/100th mm.Now, when the original SfxPoolItem is converted to the UNO status thing, that conversion is made (as documented in offapi/com/sun/star/frame/status/UpperLowerMarginScale.idl ...) - see SfxDispatcher::QueryState and SfxDispatchController_Impl::StateChanged. But when this is used in SfxToolBoxControl::statusChanged to re-construct the SfxPoolItem, there is simply hardcoded 0 passed to SfxPoolItem::PutValue. Of course this doesn't affect ControllerItem, because it gets the original SfxPoolItem from sfx2.",3,3856,2016-05-31 14:57:13,2016-06-08 17:10:31,194,MERGED,12.0,1312.0,3,7,14,1

It does not affect how other code handles it. Of course if we get a lot of SEH excepions from outside of our control that are currently caught in one of the catch all handlers we are going to crash a lot.EHs has basically two effects on the code. catch(...) will not catch SEH exceptions and there is no stack nwinding and destructor calls going to be for SEH exceptions.I think both are fine in our code. The case that some external part is handling SEH with EHa should not concern us as if we get a SEH from that cod ewe will just crash and if that code handles it we are not going to see it anyway.,2,4026,2016-06-20 07:02:47,2016-06-20 13:55:10,6,MERGED,9.0,70.0,5,9,2,0

703,Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1(1 comment)This commit needs to be split into at least 2 if not more patches.This mixes so many things (even if they are all related to validation). E.g. I'm unhappy with the DOCX part in the chart test unless someone is going to maintain them. I'm happy to maintain the calc parts and as far as I know I'm the only one really caring about the chart tests.At least all the non binary validation changes in the chart code need to go into an independent patch that can be discussed independently. With the current chart change this -1 should be seen as meaning a -2 with the chance to remove the -1 by splitting the unrelated parts into an own commit.For the calc part it is surely not the best idea to add uncommented code when are actually discouraging that. Hide it behind a ifdef or something like that to make it clearer that it is actually useful and should not be removed directly.,5,4211,2016-06-03 14:39:40,2016-06-10 15:33:25,168,MERGED,11.0,156.0,4,5,7,0

It could be an incomplete formula or an invalid value whichwould result in throwing error for all dependent cells. We only want to updatethese dependent cells in some particular condition, say pressing enter, informula bar.

841,"Patch Set 8:(21 comments)So I have one general comment related to the concept and a few related to the actual implementation.I'm not sure if that is really a good approach. In general I think instead of trying to change the equation we should make it clear to the user that we could not layout his chart correctly and that he should look into fixing the layout. So a more make the user aware of the problems than trying to work around problems.I suggest that you contact the UX team and tell them about your idea and my concerns.Related to the code:I'm not happy with some of the special values, especially the use of 0 as formula length to signal that the formula length can be ignored. I think a cleaner solution is something like sal_Int32* pFormulaLength = NULL and require the caller to use a NULL pointer to signal that the parameter needs to be ignored. That makes IMHO the code cleaner as it is directly obvious that we are not talking about a zero length string.I'd also like to see a comment why the aValueString checks are necessary despite the earlier checks that this value is not handled in that place.I'm going to look into the localization issue that I saw as that looks like a serious problem.And finally I was unable to follow all corner cases in the new code. So if we are really going to merge this code, I'd like to see a unit test for nearly all special cases. Additionally a few comments explaining what we are doing would be helpful. Currently it is nearly impossible to figure out why some cases need special handling. An exmaple for that (which I have still no idea why it is correct) is that in one case we multiply nFormulaLength by 2 if aValueString is ""1"".This was a really review and I suggest that you start by talking to the UX guys. If they have more questions they can contact me.",8,5133,2015-08-15 19:52:33,2015-12-18 16:23:07,2996,MERGED,17.0,464.0,5,6,11,0

These 3 functions don't have an _xlfn prefix in OOXML as they don't exist there. I haven't fully checked yet if all entries in formulabase.cxx and xlformula.cxx are correct here.-My main efforts so far have been to get the functions working as they should (and changing constraints where MS Excel preaches them but does _not_ apply them).I want to change one last constraint (the time(X)-interval needs to be constant, but in case of dates an interval of months (28 to 31 days) is accepted by Excel. I have to find out how much deviation is accepted by Excel and how to incorporate this in the code, with interpolation in forecasts etc..Then I want to do a lot of numerical comparisons between Calc and Excel - where possible.Then I need to make a unit test; simple no-difference check with Excel is not possible as it is a forecast and the result depends on the exact method and sometimes random numbers.Then I want to go through the code again with a toothbrush.Then I want to prepare help-text (for someone else to put into the repository).And then my draft could become a real submission.We'll be in 2016 be then, it's a huge job - for me, at least ;)",6,7278,2015-11-20 07:47:06,2015-12-21 18:30:46,754,MERGED,14.0,1804.0,3,10,16,0

When the user opens a password-protected document (without providing a password, or with wrong password) it will fail. Loading will fail. End of story.The UI should report the failure and prompt for password. Another load request should then be sent to the server, with the password, to try loading again.There is no need to have a password command, or remembering the jail url, or having a new callback (modify load callback to take the optional password) etc. All we need is for 'load' to have an optional password that is passed to the right API when provided.If 'load' fails, then everything fails and the user can try again. It's a fatal error to load a document and without a document there is no need to maintain anything at all (certainly no child). I'd even close the socket and cleanup everything. The UI should handle this case in a friendly fashion.Fail, return, prompt the user, and let them try again.Let's discuss if there are any design questions.

1337,"Patch Set 3:Ashod: Hmm, the design concern is actually a good point; unfortunately on the LibreOffice side, it asks for the password interactively, so the LOK API was (naturally) extended so that we can interactively answer.Having said that, on the loolwsd level, it can be done as you suggest - return from load with ""no password provided"" error, ask the user for the password, and re-try the load completely (now with the password remembered).

When another 'load' command comes (with or without a password), the flow goes all the way through broker finding appropriate child to host the new document URI.Additionally, this also prevents caching for password protected documents with the help newly introduced bunch of password related variables and successful document load acknowledgment to parent process.'statusindicatorfinish:' is now used as an acknowledgment of successful document load operation on server side, as well as client side.

It's basic functionality to convert SVG XML to ODF XML is a good basic functionality, the only reasons to 'park' it now and not to invest more work is that SVGIO is capable of more features, that the XML conversion is limited in getting perfect due to ODF restrictions and that it is too much work to develop both.

I tried that. And can give it another try. But it would require a much bigger change, obviously. The main problem is that wingdi.h is actually included from other windows headers too. So we can't fully control when it's included. But can give it another shot and narrow it down further.

But my change will neither help nor harm that case :)(I only fixed the reverse, which is that wingdi.h is included before Common.hxx.)And I believe that case doesn't exist now (if they existed, I fixed them).Containing windows headers in postwin.h will help (which I fully support). But even then, once a header that includes wingdi.h (directly or indirectly) is included in the pch, then we still face the same issue. So it's really tricky.Since I was working on pch files, it was this latter case that really made things complicated. The way to avoid that is to never include an uncontained header that leaks in the pch, which is what we do. So the only case that breaks the build is when RGB is defined before Office/Common.hxx, which I patched.Actually, I think what we should do is add #undef RGB to postwin.h (even when currently it's not needed).

The Rectangle is *not* the place to keep such information. It's place is at the model (the SdrObject). See ::TRGetBaseGeometry implementations where the mirroring is coming from - e.g in SdrObjCustomShape it *is* a model member (X and Y).Currently - except for the SdrObjCustomShape and SdrGrafObj - the mirrored states are not preserved - the mirroring is geometrically *executed* on the existing geometry, that's it (aw080 changes this).You can see this sad truth e.g. at the graphic object - insert one in Draw/Impress and add text. Hor mirror does not change the text at all, vertical mirror uses a 180 deg rotation, *not* a true vert mirroring.This only does not come to more attention due to the fact that nearly all shapes are CustomShapes nowadays...Do not forget: mirror in X and Y equals a 180 deg rotation (can be seen/proved looking at the corrresponding homogen matrix)",4,9572,2015-11-22 06:04:36,2015-11-23 14:27:02,32,MERGED,3.0,41.0,3,5,5,1

2142,"Patch Set 3:I am not sure, but a compiler should use some optimizations for loops here and it will not affect basic operations as much.Moreover (I am sure that you know about it :) ) sum, sum of square, count and product for a single reference, a range of cells and a list of values (I mean e.g. ""=SUM(2;3;4)"") are calculated by the ScInterpreter::IterateParameters, not by ScMatrixImpl methods. The second ones are called for values in brackets (""=SUM({5;3;1}""). I probably missed something, cause I'm still finding new things in the code, but I think a bit worse performance could be noticeable only in some corner cases, e.g. when user will type by hand a few thousand numbers between parenthesis ...but still.Similarly for average, max and min values - most of the time they are calculated by ScInterpreter, not ScMatrix methods. Could it be changed to have one operation in one place?I made this change thinking, beside performance, also about further code reductions. It will be nice to have one functor for all operations resulting in a single value, but it seems that I didn't take a few elements (e.g. some operations count elements, other do not) into account and it's rather a premature optimization than a real gain. In the end, for now, the solution with two templates seems to be the best for me.",3,10470,2015-08-08 13:47:19,2015-08-09 21:30:58,31,MERGED,2.0,118.0,3,6,5,0

2263,"Patch Set 6:I checked MSO and i was mistaken with my assumptions, all is fine except that the left and right margins should be left as is. The intent of the feature is to eliminate white space between (above and below) pages, so there is less scrolling up and down through the document, so there isnt a to need hide left and right margins, as that alters how the page would be displayed, as more content jumps to previous pages.

I mentioned this somewhere as a limitation. The reason for this is that the page size is the same, but the margins are removed/reduced. So the text is allowed to fill in more surface area. This could be solved by changing the page dimensions in hide-whitespace mode. I didn't try to do that, again, to get initial feedback. > In case i didnt mention it before, i am part of the design and UX > teams. :DFantastic!

Good to know. The reason I wrote this script is because I have another patch that improves pch generation (a rewrite of update_pch in python that updates every single pch in the codebase in a few seconds). It was obvious to me that to improve the pch generation to make builds faster I had to deal with the problem of conflicting headers (that are excluded from pch) and required headers (that will break the build if left out). This script solves the latter problem, so now what is included in pch headers is purely to accelerate builds, not to prevent the build from breaking.Will submit the update_pch script and updated pch files sometime soon, as time permits.",1,11103,2015-09-01 00:33:37,2015-09-01 00:33:37,0,MERGED,16.0,378.0,4,6,2,1

I think all that is required is to adjust http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/basic/source/classes/sbxmod.cxx#1809 (or get rid of that method and adjust the caller (in scriptcont) to pass the current binary format versionplease see https://bz.apache.org/ooo/show_bug.cgi?id=64377needless to say that stuff needs to be retested too (but it would be good to get it in)It is of course possible to juggle the version numbers (and code) in such away to implement just this new update to the binary format (and skip enabling aoo#64377) that's fine too, but...

Any chance you can create one ? > Thanks !Depends what you mean by ""work."" The timers of course _do_ work, but that is not the problem I'm fixing. I'm fixing the issue with high idle CPU utilization. Periodic timers should reset their start time so that they re-fire only after the duration has expired. The issue, I found, is that Timer thinks it's ready to fire again at the next tick. Ticks come in for the _soonest_ next timer delay (this is because we really have only one system timer callback, and we need it to fire for the next timer in the queue). In the worst case they come in immediately (after 1ms) and in those cases Timer thinks it's ready to fire again, which it does. This doesn't cause any obvious problems, other than CPU utilization where there shouldn't be any (because Timer handles background jobs, like spellchecking, which wastes some CPU and returns, but the waste is proportional to the document size and number of documents open).It is clear from the code that nowhere is the start-time reset. Of course I had the luxury of debugging and seeing what was happening, but the code and my comments make it almost trivial to trace the variable in question and see that without changing it, it will trick Timer into firing again. (See Timer::ReadyForSchedule where mnUpdateTime is used.)I can add unittest for this but, from experience, timers are not reliable enough to trap them within a reasonable time frame from make the test meaningful. On a non-realtime OS, they come with no guarantees. And they are less consistent across a number of OSes. We can have a crude ""test fire once"" and ""test don't fire too soon"" but it's harder to have ""fired too late."" Also, it's much harder to simulate the myriads of jobs we have and the arbitrary periods of each (and how they overlap).I'll give it a shot, but applying and running a large document with this 1 liner will show that the idle CPU utilization does go to 0.",5,11525,2015-07-19 17:33:11,2015-07-20 00:08:15,6,MERGED,1.0,3.0,5,7,5,1

So - I think we need to undo that everywhere.The twain header re-defines HPBYTE for its own internal use - we shouldn't touch that I think; please drop that piece.Otherwise I think you've got it =)If you re-push a tweaked version with s/Scanline/sal_uInt8*/ in your changes - and git commit --amend locally - ie. keeping the same change-id and re-push; then it should update this commit & re-trigger a CI build.Thanks muchly :-),1,11933,2015-07-17 16:28:01,2015-07-17 16:28:01,0,MERGED,9.0,69.0,3,6,3,0

2767,"Patch Set 4:@Kohei : After textdetect filter call, in the call to SfxMedium::GetMedium_Impl()both pImp->xStream and pImp->xInputStream are populated. At line number 2340, in this method, pImp->m_pInstream is populated from pImp->xStream rather than pImp->xInputStream due to the order of if-else statements. I think that pImp->xStream is uncompressed as I did not set MediaDescriptor::PROP_STREAM property in media descriptor in the detect code.The csv import dialog uses the xInputStream directly where as the ScDocShell::ConvertFrom() uses SvStream from SfxMedium::GetInStream()I tried to reverse the order of if-else statement in SfxMedium::GetMedium_Impl() (starting at line number 2340). But soon realized that it is not correct as1) it breaks some unit tests (import of pdf files failed)2) Though the spreadsheet now shows uncompressed data, the csv import dialog shows empty data !. I thought it was due to file stream position set to the end, but seeking the pImp->xInputStream to the beginning did not solve that.So I reverted this change and instead tried assigning to both MediaDescriptor::PROP_STREAM and MediaDescriptor::PROP_INPUTSTREAM properties in the textdetect filter code as follows :uno::Reference<io::XStream> xStreamDecompressed(new utl::OStreamWrapper(*pDecompressedStream));                                                                                                    aMediaDesc[MediaDescriptor::PROP_STREAM()] <<= xStreamDecompressed;                                                                                                                                aMediaDesc[MediaDescriptor::PROP_INPUTSTREAM()] <<= xStreamDecompressed->getInputStream();This change seems to work, no unit test failed, and uncompressed data in both spreadsheet and csv import dialog.

2768,"Patch Set 8: Code-Review-1The import part looks good, and functions very well.  Great job on doing your analysis and coming up with a very well thought-out solution.Now, the only remaining issue is the saving.  Right now, when you open a csv.gz file, edits it, and hits Ctrl-S, it saves it back to the file uncompressed, while the extension is intact.  This is not ideal.I can think of 2 ways to resolve this.  The first way is to support saving it back gz compressed, by somehow storing the information that this file has been uncompressed and using that information and trigger gz compression on saving.  In this scenario, you need to be careful not to compress on save when the user decides to save the file with a different name.  There would be other corner cases you'd have to handle when going this route. Personally I don't like this solution.The 2nd way is to load the file read only when the file is automatically uncompressed during file detection.  This way, when the user wants to edit it and re-save it, she won't be able to overwrite the original file.  I personally like this solution.Here is the gotcha, though.  Forcing a read-only load is as easy as setting the read only flag to true with the media descriptor, which will prompt you that the document has been opened read only, and to edit it, the user will need to click ""Edit document"" to create a new document instance.  When you do that, Calc will still load the compressed stream into the 2nd document instance, not the uncompressed version.  This needs to be addressed.I hope this will not be too much trouble to solve.  Good luck!",8,13520,2015-04-15 16:52:16,2015-04-20 15:06:52,118,MERGED,3.0,46.0,2,3,10,0

2881,"Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1This patch still has issues.1) The new option shouldn't be added to the popup window since it's not an action but it's an attribute. The popup window is the wrong place to house this option.  It should go to the Field options dialog which can be reached from the layout dialog by double-clicking on the field name (which is kinda hidden, I know).  Once that dialog is open, you still need to click on the Options button to get to the actual dialog where you need to add this option.2) This should be a field (or dimension as it's called in the code) option. As such, it should be stored in ScDPSaveDimension as a new boolean member, not in ScDPSaveData, which should only store table-wide options.3) ODF export code should also reflect that, and store the new setting as a dimension attribute.

2908,"Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1The basic idea is a good one here. Clearly the ScHorizontalAttrIter is used in a ton of places across the code-base, particularly in filters, and making it ~instant for all the common big-data cases is very helpful.The basic approach looks good too - the nMinNextEnd looks sensible to detect large runs of identical formatting.What doesn't convince me that much is the initialization and management of the pPrevColEnd array. It looks like that is not initialized initially [sic] ;-) and then there is an assumption that:                if ( bRepeatedRow )                    nCol = pPrevColEnd[nCol];-but- (AFAICS) there is no guarentee that pPrevColEnd[nCol] is setup correctly - it rather depends on the value of nCol that was used last time - which (in turn) depends on the shape of the data.So - I would suggest adopting a different approach for generating and managing that - along with some nicer data structure for this case. IIWY I'd detect the case where there is a large run of identical styles - and in that case do more work to analyze them into a complete structure - that can be re-used for several subsequent rows; eg. if there are > 2x rows with the same thing - then allocate & fill that structure in (eg.).Is that do-able ? hopefully it'll make the code flow more pleasant too =)I'd also like to see a unit test created for the case that looks like it should fail in the above =) where we have constant patterns down a run - but a random layout of cell content.Thanks !",3,14212,2015-02-18 00:36:37,2015-02-18 00:36:37,0,MERGED,2.0,51.0,2,3,6,0

3228,"Patch Set 2:Looks good to me, thanks! :-) I'll merge it in a bit.

3229,"Patch Set 3:Hi Mikos, I don't understand how export tests were done. That's why I did it in a more conservative way, putting it in import tests.It is my concern that numbering types are not one to one mapping. A sequence like import, export, import lose information by nature. For example there are many cases fallback into NUMBER_LOWER_ZH. However it seems that the patchset for rtfexport can compile ( did it ever make check? ) , It contradict my guess.",3,15875,2014-11-08 15:45:16,2014-11-09 21:42:20,29,MERGED,10.0,104.0,3,6,3,1
3230,"Patch Set 3:When designing the framework, we had two basic ideas:- interesting document models are easier to be loaded from some format, than building them from code- checking an in-memory document model is reasonably easy (usually by using the UNO API), at least easier than asserting a written file (think of manually checking a binary .doc result)That's why for export tests, we do an import->export->import sequence. That ensures that the doc. models can be still stored in a file, allows asserting the result using the UNO API, and still export problems are detected. (I'm just re-stating what's in sw/qa/extras/README, just in case for some reason that file is not clear.) Hopefully this makes it clear how export tests are done. :-)Regarding loosing data during import/export: sure, sometimes that's necessary when e.g. our numbering types and MSO's numbering types do not match. In your case, the provided tests passed just fine when also the exporter got included in the chain, that's why I changed that. As long as it passes, it's safe to change, and it ensures that your export improvements won't break in the future silently. ;-)",3,15875,2014-11-08 15:45:16,2014-11-09 21:42:20,29,MERGED,10.0,104.0,3,6,3,0

Unfortunately ImplGrabFocus() can't be used outside vcl, which would be a simple way (e.g. using ImplGrabFocus(GETFOCUS_F6) inside BackingWindow too).I was wrong. It seems mouse click doesn't lead to GetFocus() call (maybe that's why there is no a GETFOCUS_MOUSE flag?) so for simplicity I keep at the first version (select first item in all case when GetFocus is called).",3,19694,2014-01-17 01:08:37,2014-01-19 09:28:42,56,MERGED,7.0,97.0,2,7,5,1

It solves a couple of issues: it checks adapter existence before enabling / disabling it instead of checking everywhere, it should help to acquire adapter the proper way on higher platforms [1] instead of duplicating code everywhere. Plus you instantiate property directly but I was trying to init them in constructors only to avoid mess. Null checks is just element of style so I can close my eyes on this part.Anyway my vote seems to be ignored at all.

4410,"Patch Set 1:Hmm, I'm not entirely 100% sure about this, but:getDefaultAdapter still exists and should work according to the API (it's not marked as deprecated, the methods docs haven't changed), and hence should work for us for all supported Android versions. Moreover there are no reports of it breaking with 4.3 that I can find (I imagine there'd be quite some uproar if existing apps were suddenly broken by Android 4.3)...It seems the getSystemService way of getting the adapter was added for consistency (as that's how the Wifi adapter is usually retrieved) -- and it's use is obviously encouraged for new apps, but we specifically want to support 2.3+ for now, so still need to at least have getDefaultAdapter.So, unless there is specific evidence that getDefaultAdapter has been broken we only need to support getDefaultAdapter and can ignore the getSystemService way of doing things, in which case the wrapper is unnecessary.

Splitting that up would result in unbuildable project/mix of abs and android support lib. Not what you want.And did you even bother to look at the patch? All those changes are trivial, basically replacing ""Sherlock"" with ""Compat"" or similar> First, you are changing minimum SDK version we are not interested in ÔÇö there is a sweet ICS future, it is more wise to move forward instead of backward.Changing the minimum version doesn't impact use of new ICS features at all. That's what the support libraries are for. ActionBarSherlock previously, and the default android support library in the proposal.You fail to mention what ICS features are lost by that, so please elaborate. And of course one doesn't need to lower it - but why artificially limiting the usable devices when there is no reason?> Second, changing target SDK should be supported via build servers to not fail.No idea what you mean by that. Target SDK is the version that is definitely supported, i.e. in this case the version that runs on a device I personally own, did personally test with. But again, no biggie to leave that at present values.> Third, we are not interested at moment in switching from ABS to ABCWho is ""we""?> because LO Android port uses ABS anyway and,How is the LO Android port related to the Impress Remote? The remote(s) have already been decoupled translation wise, release-schedule wise, so I fail to see how the remote is bound to the Android port.Again the changes are small, the android support libraries stack up easily to support newer features.You mentioned that newer versions have nice features and you'd rather drop support for older devices: using the android support libs makes that easy. In Fact the ABS one already used the v4 support library itself.> again, this should be supported via build servers.And again no idea what you mean by that. If you mean it should be buildable by ant/using the makefiles and not by using Eclipse, you should see that I also updated the makefile.I didn't bother to add a check whether the v7 support library has been installed on the machine, as it is not built as part of LO anyway, and the error message will be pretty obvious in that case....If you insist, I can also add configure checks. Or do the easy way as with the abs and check it into the repo.> Fourth, SettingsActivity after your change wouldnÔÇÖt have an action bar on pre-Honeycomb versions.It will.> I agree with you that ABS ÔåÆ ABC migration makes sense but there is a *really low* percentage of users using Gingerbread.I didn't change it because I wanted to lower the minimumSDK, that was just the result of the lint check that this is the minimum that the code uses.> It makes a very little sense for me to swap dependencies for things that just work for platform version which *potentially* could be dropped.I don't care about the minimum SDK, so don't fixate on that.  I did swap dependencies for the contrary, to make it easier to extend later with new features. Even the author of the ABS wrote that ABS has done its job, that with the android support lib v7 there is no reason to use ABS anymore. That of course doesn't mean one should swap components, never change a running system yadda,yadda, but the remote is small, the change as a whole is small, so it is (IMHO) a sensible thing to do.You also state on the one-hand pre honeycomb (aka gingerbread) would look different, but on the other hand you're willing to just drop support for gingerbread completely.

4949,"Patch Set 3: AbandonedWe have to set the values to the _maximum_ SDK we want to use. Otherwise Windows features will be dropped and not be available to LibreOffice. If features are implemented eg. since Windows Vista we need to do runtime checks and define the corresponding structs, function and so on.But the minimum supported Windows version must be checked with _WIN32_WINNT set to the corresponding version. And get a regular build to detect such problems! If this is set to WinXP (0x0502) only parts of the SDK are enabled, which are within these conditionals (checked by _NTDDI_VERSION, _WIN32_WINNT and sometimes _WINVER). Defining _WIN32_WINNT defines both other macros to the same value. Only by setting _WIN32_WINNT we could detect incompatible features, which build fine on Windows 7 and don't work on Windows XP/Vista/whatever.Those WINVER conditionals are bogus, because they are highly dependant on the build machine!

4957,"Patch Set 2:Now the settings are applied globally.And I found out how to use the macros:_WIN32_WINNT sets NTDDI_VERSION and WINVER automatically to the same version.But setting NTDDI_VERSION or WINVER sets only the macro itself.If we want to target Windows XP we need to set _WIN32_WINNT, because otherwise other SDK stuff is still included under Windows 7. But this brings us some kind of dilemma: How do we add features which are added in Windows 7 (like 9a4a84df5406cdcde1f4d23a1cea2b109998f35b)? If we set WINVER globally those features are never activated.One solution could be to check:#ifdef NTDDI_WIN7Works fine, but checks only what is supported by the Windows API (what if Win8 SDK is installed on Win7?).Maybe we should move this to the mailing list.",2,20518,2013-10-30 22:11:18,2013-10-31 20:12:53,22,MERGED,56.0,188.0,2,3,6,0

That way then it would be possible to avoid introducing the ugly DECLARE_OOXML_TEST / RUN_OOXML_TEST macros.I mean such a change causes some pain on backports, so if we do it, I think we should do it properly, not hiding copy&paste behind macros. :-)",1,20755,2013-10-17 09:41:51,2013-10-17 09:43:42,0,MERGED,1.0,350.0,1,1,8,1

5896,Patch Set 5:The vigra::copyImage is not handling copy areas in the same image so the code is checking whether the src and dst are same buffer and directing it to scaleImage which is very slow.The whole concept of pixel accessors is a huge overhead in the case of direct pixel copy (vigra::copyImage is also using pixel accessors).The idea here was to identify when direct memory copy is applicable (when src.size==dst.size && src.format==dst.format) and use direct memory block copy and not pixel wise copy.The result is 100x faster than vigra implementation.This direct copy is also handling the case when the src and dst are same buffer by copy it from bottom to top when needed and using memmove instead of memcpyabout using long or int for iterating i'm not keen on the cross platform details please advice how to do it properly.,5,21135,2013-08-30 19:29:50,2013-09-03 22:26:37,98,MERGED,1.0,88.0,3,5,8,1

The type is readily available as a string via Any::getValueTypeName (and it would arguably be a good idea to always include it in the output, like ""Any of type T with value V"", or for cases where we have no code to print the value just ""Any of type T,"" or something less verbose but containing the same amount of information).* The TypeClass values UNION and ARRAY are unused historic mistakes; and typelib_TypeClass_MAKE_FIXED_SIZE is an artefact of the UNO C++ language binding, not a legal value of UNO enum TypeClass.* Likewise, the TypeClass values TYPEDEF, SERVICE, MODULE, INTERFACE_METHOD, INTERFACE_ATTRIBUTE, UNKNOWN, PROPERTY, CONSTANT, CONSTANTS, and SINGLETON are only used to represent UNOIDL entities unrelated to the UNO type system.  They are never used for values of type Any.* Likewise, a UNO ANY cannot contain a nested ANY (cf. <http://www.openoffice.org/udk/common/man/typesystem.html>).  That is, all cases other than VOID, BOOLEAN, BYTE, SHORT, UNSIGNED_SHORT, LONG, UNSIGNED_LONG, HYPER, UNSIGNED_HYPER, FLOAT, DOUBLE, CHAR, STRING, TYPE, SEQUENCE, ENUM, STRUCT, EXCEPTION, and INTERFACE should be subsumed under  default:    assert(false); // this cannot happen    break;(And whenever I write code that lists all those UNO type system tags, I stick with the above order as given at <http://www.openoffice.org/udk/common/man/typesystem.html>, not the completely stupid and arbitrary one from the TypeClass enum.)* Add @since LibreOffice 4.2.",2,21674,2013-08-12 07:03:08,2013-08-12 07:43:12,0,MERGED,2.0,83.0,2,3,4,0

Duckduckgoing(or Googling) for W3CDTF makes it clear that ""W3CDTF"" usuallymeans http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime, so I assumed thatthis was the format the function was supposed to parse. 1) Was the W3CDTF in the function name meant as a reference     to that note? Dunno, ask its author. 2) In that case, was the reference itself an error? Michael's     research seems to indicate this would be the case.IRC (or mailing list?) discussion also basically said that as faras we know, the timezone component of this fix may not mattermuch since Microsoft Office always writes UTC (Zulu) time,so the bug would never get triggered. I think that it is stillpreferable to fix the bug to avoid that other code calls thisfunction in situations where the bug happens.So, my opinion would be:1) As proactive safety, apply this patch to master & 4-1.    (possibly an adapted part of it to 4-0; adapted because    sub-second stuff is different in 4-0: centiseconds instead    of nanoseconds) 2) In master, provided we have a volunteer to unravel that     quagmire (that knows about OOXML or willing to find out     about it), merge with sax::Converter date/time-parsing     if appropriate... If not appropriate, maybe migrate this     function to sax::Converter (along with documentation-by-     comment explaining why we need different parsers for     different formats and the difference between them), so     that our date/time-parsing code is all in one place.Since nobody clearly vetoed this patch, I'm going to push ""1)"" to master soon, unless someone vetoes.",3,21753,2013-07-05 15:12:51,2013-08-09 06:59:13,831,MERGED,1.0,56.0,2,5,4,1

However, wYear is documented as ""The valid values for this member are 1601 through 30827,"" so negative pDateTime->Year values would in practice wrap around to wYear >= 32768 > 30827 and SystemTimeToFileTime should return false, so everything should happen to work out fine.",1,22128,2013-07-05 10:11:42,2013-07-05 10:23:11,0,MERGED,5.0,17.0,3,3,4,0

The <...> form is for standard headers (provided through the compiler), while the ""..."" form is for arbitrary source files (provided by the compiler's client).  (The use of ""header"" in the Standard does not necessarily reflect colloquial usage of that term.  The exact mechanisms are implementation-defined in any case, but the <compiler/platform> vs. ""client"" is the general idea.

10844,"Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisHmm, I am not sure that I like this change. It does not create the formatting entry without any explanation. You were able to edit the unused formatting and add the range later in the past.For example, imagine that you define some formatting, forget to define the range, and press the ""Add"" button. You will not know why the entry was not created. You will need to select everything again and again until you find why it does not work :-)IMHO, the best solution would be to preffil the range with the current selected cell(s). For example, the DataPilot or Chart is created from the current selection by default as well.Hmm, the prefil would be annoying if you lose some older formatting  in the selected cells. In this case, I would prefer to leave the behavior as is and fix it with the error dialog for 4.1. IMHO, the behavior is more annoying with the patch than without it.BTW: I really like the conditional formatting. It is very cool and useful feature.

10985,"Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisThanks for your patch submission.The intent of this change is good, but the code needs a bit more polishing in minor details.1) We use BSD bracing style which isif (foo){    ...}else{    ...}rather than if (foo) {    ...} else {    ...}Inconsistency in bracing style affects readability. Let's make it consistent.2) Normally, when branching with an if statement on a boolean conditional, it's best to set the code block for the true condition first, followed by the one for the false condition in the 'else' block.  So in this case it's best to doif (Application::GetSettings().GetLayoutRTL()){    <code for RTL>}else{    <code for non-RTL>}This will make following the logic of the code a teeny bit easier for human brain.3) Last point is that, the only differences between the RTL and non-RTL case is the value of nXOffset (the first line in each block) and the rendering::TextDirection enum value (the last line in each block). Let's just make these values conditional while keeping the rest of the code outside the if statement block. Code duplication done this way is not a very good style.

11288,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1(1 comment)The idea to merge the two threads (callback handler and tile rendering) is reasonable, but we should discuss the approach.The starvation you noticed happens because you are using the tile-queue, which is designed for... well, yes, tiles! :)It reorders the messages such that it renders tiles in large blocks first. So with heavy typing the callback messages always end up getting overtaken by tiles, which the queue explicitly favors, thereby starving callback events.So this is one problem with the current implementation. I think the tiles should have its own queue, and callbacks a separate one. The thread that pumps them would process one callback, then one tile-rendering.Another issue with combining these threads is that there will be reduction in performance. This is because before and after rendering a tile there is significant work being done that does *not* execute with the Solar lock. This code (mostly encoding to PNG) is CPU intensive and can run in parallel to other code (even to other rendering calls).Finally, I have submitted my patch (342125b8ea) to fix the missing tiles issue. Should be easier to read than describe it here (it's only +27, -6). It comes with detailed commit log too. So this approach is mostly an optimization to reduce the thread-count, but, as mentioned, we need multiple threads because we have opportunity to parallelize, and merging them will reduce performance (unless benchmark proves otherwise, of course).",1,25170,2016-09-22 19:59:12,2016-09-22 20:49:06,0,ABANDONED,1.0,163.0,2,4,1,1
11289,"Patch Set 1:Wrt. the starvation - actually that was due to the logging; we have so much debugging stuff that it was blocking considerably when writing to the console, making the queue grow.  Without that, all works fine even with the unmodified TileQueue :-)But I worked on the TileQueue too - it seems unnecessary to do all the priority shuffling when inserting, when the prioritization changes with every view switch, and instead do it only when the tile is requested - which seems to work nicely.Wrt. an own queue for tiles - that is exactly the thing that makes the synchronzation hard, as then it is necessary to synchronize between those 2 queues; which in turn kills all the advantage of 2 queues :-)Wrt. PNG compression; if we want to thread it, then let's thread just the compression - that'll make it local, more maintainable, and we can go with as many threads there as we wish (for just the PNG compression piece of code).Wrt. the 342125b8ea - thanks for that!  Unfortunately that again just adds code :-(Either way, please check https://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/online/log/?h=private/kendy/tilesandcallbacks , I'd really like to get that in...

11437,Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1(2 comments)So there are my two purely coding style related comments but also one about memory corruption that I need to think about.I think some dispose calls are wrong and might cause access to deleted objects. I need to follow the code a bit for this.All in all this is a great catch and should solve one of the bigger memory leaks in ODF export and OOXML import.,3,25494,2015-11-29 23:14:43,2016-05-17 12:06:35,4068,ABANDONED,4.0,33.0,4,8,3,1
11438,Patch Set 3: Code-Review-2I have to change my -1 to a -2. The code in XMLTableMasterPageExport.cxx is wrong. The lifecycle is messed up by these dispose calls on objects returned from getPropertyValue.This either leads to bugs (the object has been destroyed while it should not and therefore we have empty references) or even worse to access to deleted memory. Both cases are not something that I want to see in a backport.Another point is that instead of the normal public dispose methods these classes should inherit from XComponent. I'm not a fan of UNO myself but reinventing a new way to break cyclic references will only lead to problems later.Now for a way forward we need to fix the problems mentioned here and if it is safe enough we can think about a backport again.

Moggi was of the opinion that the setPropertyValue() from editeng couldn't be called here. But the current one is unable to support that property (UNO_TC_PROP_TEXTFIELD_TYPE). How would it be possible to proceed?I'm influenced by this comment <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/offapi/com/sun/star/text/textfield/Type.idl#19> when I say the above.Also, I did a '#define UNO_NAME_TEXT_FIELD_TYPE ""TextFieldType""' in <opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sw/inc/unoprnms.hxx> taking other properties from here <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/include/editeng/unonames.hxx> as an example. But I'm unsure if this is the right way to proceed.Since I've mentioned '[optional, property]long TextFieldType;' as optional in <opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/offapi/com/sun/star/text/textfield/ExtendedUser.idl>, I might need a boolean to indicate when 'setPropertyValue()' must be called for each of the fields from <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/offapi/com/sun/star/text/textfield/Type.idl> in here <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/xmloff/source/text/txtfldi.cxx#706>.

Since you didn't remember filing this bug, if there is something else that you'd want me to work on, please do tell.I would have loved to work on creating MAR files (from onlineupdate module), and still do think that's the best thing to do as it would mean I would get a headstart when it comes to the actual coding period begin dates, and had sent a mail to you regarding that.

I wasn't able to finish build with android when I wasbuilding 824139e28b3c9e0d448ee8abc580f06a4a434002.I expect this problem was fixed later as 14060e76e33cfb305c1469fecf7db688bf8a8858 gotbuilt fine.For building 824139e28b3c9e0d448ee8abc580f06a4a434002 I also had to disable opengl - patchin https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/#/c/23614/ but this is probably also invalid.,1,25623,2016-03-29 21:59:27,2016-03-29 22:36:24,0,ABANDONED,1.0,2.0,5,10,1,1
11510,"Patch Set 1:Is this necessary after 2428e1164b5f38da9fc2f24c5bb478e548f54a6f?Christian, sorry about the brief commit message. I was a bit upset that the headless patch was merged even though the ESC asked the author not to merge it in its current form. The opengl situation on our Android port is a bit unclear. On one hand, we disable opengl in configure, OTOH it seems we build most of the opengl code in vcl. My commit just restored that status quo, fixing the build. I also verified that the build result actually works. :-)Given that at the end Android uses cairo to render the tiles, the opengl code is not useful on Android. However, probably it's a good idea to not work on removing it from the Android binary till it's not clear if those opengl #ifdefs will go away or not in the long run. (Currently we have those ifdefs, but it's possible they will be reverted, it's not clear yet.)",1,25623,2016-03-29 21:59:27,2016-03-29 22:36:24,0,ABANDONED,1.0,2.0,5,10,1,1

11525,Patch Set 1:(1 comment)So this is going to be an ugly one.We are now hitting a limitation of the current test framework. Currently all our tests don't have access to the UI configuration as it breaks the tests. Now I don't remember why I went the way of pointing the ui path to the user profile but it still seems to be necessary. Back when I wrote that code there were however no UI files so it was still so that the whole UI should have worked. Now with the UI files this is no longer true and pointing the UI config path to a place that does not the UI files causes an exception and later a crash.I will need some time to get back into the details of the configuration management during the tests.,1,25668,2016-03-21 14:48:24,2016-03-21 14:48:24,0,ABANDONED,3.0,60.0,3,7,2,1

In the toolbar code, the instantiation would look like mpStatusListener  = new WindowStatusListener<ToolBox>(this, "".uno:ImageOrientation"");2) 2nd that actually implements the functionality for the toolbar.3) [optionally] some style clenaup arnoud, but better to avoid doing much of that.Also - is this all that was necessary to be done to fix the problem in the sidebar, or is an additional patch anticipated?Thank you for your work on this! :-) - and sorry about my initial reaction, the stylistic changes + the wrong comment triggered a warning light in my mind ;-)",3,26082,2015-11-26 15:58:42,2015-11-27 09:11:24,17,ABANDONED,13.0,321.0,3,5,3,0

He changed outInvish.cxx, (so did I,) but that isn't the point that needed change. The visible page numberings are at SlsSlotManager.cxx and drviewsa.cxx, which do actually the same work, but first one takes effect when the Slides Manager (on the left side) is active, and drviewsa.cxx when the slide editor itself is active. I didn't manage to find the UI where the code in outInvish.cxx takes effect. I changed those as well, so my patch is working properly, unlike his.

I find it highly annoying and irritating, like artificially obscuring what the code does by hiding it under a long chain of function calls.functions that are only called by one single other method, with no chances of being reused.You mention that aquiring the bt adapter might require version checks, but honestly: Before you use different api by checking the runtime version, you rather keep using the deprecated version that works flawlessly. > I cannot review other things because the commit is really huge.It just looks large, the changes themselves are small.> Can you consider opening an issue on Bugzilla first we discuss your problems with Bluetooth first and then fixing them instead of ÔÇ£recode everythingÔÇØ?The problems are:* not showing known (bonded) devices, forcing the user to make the computer visible* forcing a discovery on every start, on every use, that is useless for most users, as they usually use the same devices.

12423,"Patch Set 1: (4 inline comments)1) IMHO the negative year fix should go in independently of the time zone issue.3) Why should DateTimeRange contain only one time zone, as opposed to one for   the start value and one for the end value?3) You add time zone information to dates. I don't know the meaning of that.   What would it mean, how would it behave, what would it be used for?   For example, naively, one would think that combining a date with a time,   one would get a datetime. How does one get a datetime by combining   2003-05-17+05 with 23:00-06?   FWIW, SQL does not define a DATE WITH TIME ZONE type.4) I have my doubts about time-zoned time without a date.   How do you convert 20:00+00 to time zone +10?   Just ""wrap around"" modulo 24, i.e. make it 06:00+10?   If you answer yes to that question (that is, always compute modulo 24),   then what is the difference between 06:00+11 and 06:00-13?   The difference only makes sense if one speaks of dates...   Which says that timezones don't make sense unless we know at what date   to apply them.   FWIW, SQL defines a TIME WITH TIME ZONE TYPE, *but* here's what   the PostgreSQL documentation has to say about it:   The type time with time zone is defined by the SQL standard, but the definition exhibits properties which lead to questionable usefulness. In most cases, a combination of date, time, timestamp without time zone, and timestamp with time zone should provide a complete range of date/time functionality required by any application.   (...) we recommend using date/time types that contain both date and time when using time zones. We do not recommend using the type time with time zone (though it is supported by PostgreSQL for legacy applications and for compliance with the SQL standard).I have half a mind to add timezone *only* to DateTime and DateTimeRange,not to Date and not to Time. Note that this would more-or-less eliminateall conversion problems, and ""unlock"" the scenario ""don't add timezoneto structs, but convert everything to UTC"", since conversion of datetimevalues across timezones is AFAIK well-defined. ""Convert everything to UTC""is SQL's behaviour; in SQL all non-timezoned values are assumed to be atlocal time and a date is converted to the timestamp ""same date at time 00:00"".Alternative approach to your ""isTimezoned"": have a separate struct ""DateTimeTZ""?Your ""isTimezoned"" flag should IMHO be called ""isUTC"".Do we actually *need* *any* ""unknown timezone / local timezone"" value in memory?We could just make some assumption (UTC or local TZ) on import/parse/readand store only UTC in memory. Oh, but it would be convenient for our APIs to havethe capacity to take implicitly-localTZ values, yes.If we go the ""assume that values without explicit time zone are in local time"" route,then that flag should be called ""isUTC"".So, I've spoken of what SQL does as a reference;https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/LibreOffice4#Changes_deferred_until_4.1mentions XMLSchema-2. Let's see what it does for another reference: - It (optionally) timezones everything: date, time and datetime. - I don't see a datetimerange in it. - It understands a date as a 24-hour interval   (a DateTimeRange, from date 00:00:00.00000000 to 23:59:59.999999999 for most days,    that is except for leap seconds),    while SQL seems to consider it more like an instant, time 00:00 at that day. - A value without timezone is ""unknown timezone"" and not comparable   to a value with timezone, but on the other hand, section 3.2.7 also calls   untimezoned values ""local values"", which supports the idea that they are   ""local time"". But ""local time"" is unspecified in an interchange file format,   because the file may move from one timezone to the other.   In SQL, everything is convertible/comparable because each session has an   active ""local timezone"" which is used for all untimezoned values.Pragmatically, how close to XMLSchema-2 do we need to be?1) Is there any part of ODF/OOXML/any other format where we need to import   or export a date with timezone?2) Is there any part of ODF/OOXML/any other format where we need to import   or export a time (*not* datetime) with timezone?3) Is there any part of ODF/OOXML/any other format where there can be a   datetime with timezone OR a datetime without timezone and the difference   has some semantic significance (other than ""interpret value without   timezone in this timezone"").4) Is there any part of ODF/OOXML/any other format where we need to import   or export a datetime value without timezone and preserve unmodified as   without timezone?   The kind of scenario I'm thinking of is:   We read a datetime value without timezone from some file, and the file   does not give a context that tells us what time zone to interpret that in,   the user changes stuff, but not the part with that datetime value,   *and* when saving the file again, we need to write back the same value,   as opposed to say the UTC value of that datetime-in-local-timezone   or the same datetime value with local-timezone affixed.5) Is there any part of ODF/OOXML/any other format where we need to import   or export a datetime value without timezone, do changes on it and preserve   it as without timezone?   The kind of scenario I'm thinking of is:   We read a datetime value without timezone from some file, and the file   does not give a context that tells us what time zone to interpret that in,   the user e.g. tells us ""add one hour to that datetime value"",   *and* when saving the file again, we need to write back the new value   as untimezoned, as opposed to say the UTC value of that   datetime-in-local-timezone or the same datetime value with local-timezone   affixed.",1,27499,2013-06-27 22:43:19,2013-06-28 15:39:48,16,ABANDONED,51.0,400.0,2,2,2,0

12427,"Patch Set 3:>> Any other reason for ""store in startup-time localtime""? > Document persistence and API compatibility I'm not sure I understand what you mean by ""document persistence"". As soon as the document is saved to file, it survives the LibreOffice process that created it, which is how I understand ""persistence"" in a computer science context. If the file format asks for a local time to be saved, the file format filter can do the conversion from UTC or from ""startup-time localtime""; I have more faith in conversion from UTC, because if some code fails to do it, the bug will be obvious / immediate (to the vast majority of the world). By contrast, if some code fails to convert from ""startup-time localtime"", the actual occurrence of the bug will be quite rare and, and the bug can survive for a loooong time in our codebase (or in the code of a user of our API). As to API compatibility, well we are, by design, doing an incompatible API change here. Yes, for our internal code, we will need to convert / adapt code that *gets* a value before code that *gives* a value starts serving values with isTimeZoned==true. > To me the IsTimeZoned member doesn't make much sense other > than if it is set to false. To me, IsTimeZoned==true and IsTimeZoned==false are, in the abstract, two different data types. We stick them in the same UNO struct because it gives a smoother conversion / upgrade path, where we don't have to change the UNO struct/type in various places as we clean up the codebase. IsTimeZoned==true refers to a moment in the ""global timeline"" of Newtonian physics. We could encode it as Gregorian calendar / hour/minute/second UTC, we could encode it as martian days or as Neptune years, we could encode it in the Islamic calendar, in the Solar Hijri (Iran & Afghanistan), it the calendar of the Mayas; in the abstract it does not matter as long as each unique moment in time (up to a certain resolution) has its unique representation and vice-versa. IsTimeZoned==false refers to a Gregorian calendar / hours / minutes / seconds without pinning it on the global timeline; it is the datatype of the Gregorian calendar. (which by pure chance can also be ""recycled"" to be used for the Julian, Islamic and Solar Hijri calendars, but not e.g. for the Jewish or Maya calendar). > The application does not know the actual offset, no matter if we define > a) true==local_time_with_timezone or > b) true==UTC_with_timezone, > it will always use the current offset using/displaying different values in different > timezones for b) or calculating different UTC for a). Well, to be coherent, in the ""a)"" case, the application has to use the g_nTimeZoneOffset introduced in sax/source/tools/converter.cxx, and not whatever the current system offset is. If it wants to display a time in the current local/system timezone to the user, it will have to apply g_nTimeZoneOffset and *then* apply the current system offset. For our users (programmers using our API), we have to expose it in UNO. My worry, which seems to match yours, is that people (programmers) will, by and large, fail to do this properly and just use the current system offset instead of g_nTimeZoneOffset. Which makes ""b"" preferable, and my understanding is you agree: > For only this reason b) would be better because the actual used value would be > UTC converted to current local time. But then, if that is wanted, why not use > DateTimeWithTimeZone and TimeZone=0 ? Because DateTimeWithTimeZone is not a canonical (standard / normal) datatype for ""a moment in the global timeline"": It has several representations for the same moment in time, through the use of different TimeZone values. It is like storing the year as two integers instead of one integer: struct nonCanonDateTime{    int Year; // year    int Epoch; // Gregorian year chosen as year 0; Year+Epoch == Gregorian Year    unsigned int Month;    unsigned int Day;    unsigned int Hour;    unsigned int Minute; } Where the 14:55 on 5 October 1994 can be represented as: - Minute=55, Hour=14, Day=5, Month=11, Epoch=1238; Year=756; - Minute=55, Hour=14, Day=5, Month=11, Epoch=-722; Year=2716; - Minute=55, Hour=14, Day=5, Month=11, Epoch=0; Year=1994;   (Jesus Christ-based calendar) - Minute=55, Hour=14, Day=5, Month=11, Epoch=622; Year=1372;   (Muhammad Hijra-based calendar) - Minute=55, Hour=14, Day=5, Month=11, Epoch=-3761; Year=5755;   (Jewish ""Annu Mundi""-based calendar) It would be just as ""possible"" to use this representation, storing a year and an offset to ""standard year"". But it would be a bad choice, because it encodes a denormalised form of ""moment in time"". Using DateTimeWithTimeZone for ""moment in time"" has exactly the same flaw: denormalised form. For the same reasons that we normalise ""009"" and ""09"" and ""9"" to the same normal (canonical / standard) bitpattern 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001 0001 or (depending on platform) 0001 0001 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 when reading it from file, we should normalise ""moment in time"" to a normal/canonical value.",3,27500,2013-06-27 22:43:19,2013-07-07 12:25:21,229,ABANDONED,40.0,585.0,3,5,3,0

When evaluating the options for our unit testing frameworks we also evaluated the use of python to write our tests and decide against it for several reasons including the problems while debugging the tests.I'm a bit concerned with adding a new language for testing the c++ code. We have already the java test which go through the uno java bridge and it turned out to be a real pain to maintain these tests.Personally I prefer to keep tests in the same language as the code that should be tested to make it easier to maintain them.,1,27701,2013-03-30 21:10:48,2013-03-30 22:07:24,0,ABANDONED,11.0,421.0,3,3,2,1

12611,"Patch Set 3: Fails; I would prefer that you didn't submit thisThe hardest part of this was finding out that X11SalGraphics::GetGlyphBoundRect was involved, so kudos to discovering that.The workaround to search the lower levels if a glyph isn't found however is a bit of a bodge, because I don't think we shuold be asking for the wrong glyphs there in the first place. I think http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/commit/?id=98f56121858b4bea54d056a073005a10648785c6 should work instead.In MultiSalLayout::GetBoundRect we loop through each fallback font and union each level's GetBoundRect to get the result, which seems reasonable, except that for each level that's means a call to SalLayout::GetBoundRect which calls X11SalGraphics::GetGlyphBoundRect.Those sublevels SalLayouts don't know that they are sublevels so they never set the level bits on their glyphs. Which results in X11SalGraphics::GetGlyphBoundRect always searching for that glyph in the level 0 font, so there's a mismatch between the font the SalLayout's are created to use and the font that gets used.Now, SalLayout::GetBoundRect is a fairly simple thing, it just calls GetNextGlyphs 1 by 1 and X11SalGraphics::GetGlyphBoundRect on the result of that.  So I *think* that if we remove the specialized MultiSalLayout::GetBoundRect in favour of the default implementation, then because MultiSalLayout::GetNextGlyphs is specialized to do-the-right-thing and set up the glyph ids correctly, then we bubble the ids down to X11SalGraphics::GetGlyphBoundRect correctly to get it to use the right font and we get the correct bounding size.",3,27824,2013-01-16 13:26:26,2013-01-16 13:33:33,0,ABANDONED,1.0,21.0,2,3,3,1

12676,"Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisHi Mathias,first thanks for your patch. It is great start; Well, it does some non-standard things. I suggest to re-shufle it a bit :-)1. You already mentioned that you were unsure about    downloading the files inside configure. I suggest to   do it using the download script.   You might already see the many @FILENAME@ entries in   ooo.lst.in. They are optional. If you do not define such    variable in configure, it will be empty in the generated    ooo.lst file and it will not be downloaded.2. If you use download, it will get the files into the   $TARFILE_LOCATION instead of $SRC_ROOT/moz/zipped.      I suggest to modify the related makefiles in ""moz""    module to find the .zip archives in $TARFILE_LOCATION   Note that this approach follows the current trends.   In the past, we copied many 3rd party tarballs into   the related build subdirectories. We do not longer   do it. We already updated most makefiles to unpack the    tarballs directly from the $TARFILE_LOCATION.   3. I suggest to do not copy the dlls in configure because    it is not typical. Instead, I suggest to define variables   that will point to the files. Then you could copy the   files in the makefile that need to use the dlls.4. Please, do not remove the TABs from configure.in from    lines 4469-4515. These lines are copied into ""Makefile""    that is later tested. TABs are important in Makefiles,   so your change breaks this test.Thanks a lot for working on it. Feel free to ask if you are in doubts.",1,27953,2012-10-14 21:24:19,2012-10-14 21:24:19,0,ABANDONED,1.0,67.0,2,2,1,0

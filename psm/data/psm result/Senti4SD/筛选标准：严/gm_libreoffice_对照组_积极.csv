It does not affect how other code handles it. Of course if we get a lot of SEH excepions from outside of our control that are currently caught in one of the catch all handlers we are going to crash a lot.EHs has basically two effects on the code. catch(...) will not catch SEH exceptions and there is no stack nwinding and destructor calls going to be for SEH exceptions.I think both are fine in our code. The case that some external part is handling SEH with EHa should not concern us as if we get a SEH from that cod ewe will just crash and if that code handles it we are not going to see it anyway.,2,4026,2016-06-20 07:02:47,2016-06-20 13:55:10,6,MERGED,9.0,70.0,5,9,2,positive

It's basic functionality to convert SVG XML to ODF XML is a good basic functionality, the only reasons to 'park' it now and not to invest more work is that SVGIO is capable of more features, that the XML conversion is limited in getting perfect due to ODF restrictions and that it is too much work to develop both.

I tried that. And can give it another try. But it would require a much bigger change, obviously. The main problem is that wingdi.h is actually included from other windows headers too. So we can't fully control when it's included. But can give it another shot and narrow it down further. In fact, I spent hours trying to find what file includes the conflicting values to create this patch. > The current fix allows workdir/CustomTarget/officecfg/registry/officecfg/Office/Common.hxx > to be included, but if a source file happens to first include that > officecfg/Office/Common.hxx, then include wingdi.h, and later wants > to acutally use the struct RGB from Common.hxx, it still runs into > a problem.Well, that would be be a problem _only_ if wingdi.h was already included _before_ Office/Common.h, and in that case the build would fail because the macro would conflict with the declaration of RGB (my patch avoids this situation).However, if wingdi.h was _not_ included at the point of #undef RGB, then nothing bad would happen if it is included afterwards. Unless I missed something, I don't see how there would still be a problem, as wingdi.h will define RGB without issue.I should add that I hated this particular line of my patch. I share your view that it's best avoided altogether. But I couldn't find a better solution. Will try again though.",4,9501,2015-11-11 01:47:58,2015-11-12 10:55:41,33,MERGED,21.0,483.0,2,7,4,positive

3230,"Patch Set 3:When designing the framework, we had two basic ideas:- interesting document models are easier to be loaded from some format, than building them from code- checking an in-memory document model is reasonably easy (usually by using the UNO API), at least easier than asserting a written file (think of manually checking a binary .doc result)That's why for export tests, we do an import->export->import sequence. That ensures that the doc. models can be still stored in a file, allows asserting the result using the UNO API, and still export problems are detected. (I'm just re-stating what's in sw/qa/extras/README, just in case for some reason that file is not clear.) Hopefully this makes it clear how export tests are done. :-)Regarding loosing data during import/export: sure, sometimes that's necessary when e.g. our numbering types and MSO's numbering types do not match. In your case, the provided tests passed just fine when also the exporter got included in the chain, that's why I changed that. As long as it passes, it's safe to change, and it ensures that your export improvements won't break in the future silently. ;-)",3,15875,2014-11-08 15:45:16,2014-11-09 21:42:20,29,MERGED,10.0,104.0,3,6,3,positive

Splitting that up would result in unbuildable project/mix of abs and android support lib. Not what you want.And did you even bother to look at the patch? All those changes are trivial, basically replacing ""Sherlock"" with ""Compat"" or similar> First, you are changing minimum SDK version we are not interested in ÔÇö there is a sweet ICS future, it is more wise to move forward instead of backward.Changing the minimum version doesn't impact use of new ICS features at all. That's what the support libraries are for. ActionBarSherlock previously, and the default android support library in the proposal.You fail to mention what ICS features are lost by that, so please elaborate. And of course one doesn't need to lower it - but why artificially limiting the usable devices when there is no reason?> Second, changing target SDK should be supported via build servers to not fail.No idea what you mean by that. Target SDK is the version that is definitely supported, i.e. in this case the version that runs on a device I personally own, did personally test with. But again, no biggie to leave that at present values.> Third, we are not interested at moment in switching from ABS to ABCWho is ""we""?> because LO Android port uses ABS anyway and,How is the LO Android port related to the Impress Remote? The remote(s) have already been decoupled translation wise, release-schedule wise, so I fail to see how the remote is bound to the Android port.Again the changes are small, the android support libraries stack up easily to support newer features.You mentioned that newer versions have nice features and you'd rather drop support for older devices: using the android support libs makes that easy. In Fact the ABS one already used the v4 support library itself.> again, this should be supported via build servers.And again no idea what you mean by that. If you mean it should be buildable by ant/using the makefiles and not by using Eclipse, you should see that I also updated the makefile.I didn't bother to add a check whether the v7 support library has been installed on the machine, as it is not built as part of LO anyway, and the error message will be pretty obvious in that case....If you insist, I can also add configure checks. Or do the easy way as with the abs and check it into the repo.> Fourth, SettingsActivity after your change wouldnÔÇÖt have an action bar on pre-Honeycomb versions.It will.> I agree with you that ABS ÔåÆ ABC migration makes sense but there is a *really low* percentage of users using Gingerbread.I didn't change it because I wanted to lower the minimumSDK, that was just the result of the lint check that this is the minimum that the code uses.> It makes a very little sense for me to swap dependencies for things that just work for platform version which *potentially* could be dropped.I don't care about the minimum SDK, so don't fixate on that.  I did swap dependencies for the contrary, to make it easier to extend later with new features. Even the author of the ABS wrote that ABS has done its job, that with the android support lib v7 there is no reason to use ABS anymore. That of course doesn't mean one should swap components, never change a running system yadda,yadda, but the remote is small, the change as a whole is small, so it is (IMHO) a sensible thing to do.You also state on the one-hand pre honeycomb (aka gingerbread) would look different, but on the other hand you're willing to just drop support for gingerbread completely.

PNG compression; if we want to thread it, then let's thread just the compression - that'll make it local, more maintainable, and we can go with as many threads there as we wish (for just the PNG compression piece of code).Wrt. the 342125b8ea - thanks for that!

Moggi was of the opinion that the setPropertyValue() from editeng couldn't be called here. But the current one is unable to support that property (UNO_TC_PROP_TEXTFIELD_TYPE). How would it be possible to proceed?I'm influenced by this comment <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/offapi/com/sun/star/text/textfield/Type.idl#19> when I say the above.Also, I did a '#define UNO_NAME_TEXT_FIELD_TYPE ""TextFieldType""' in <opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sw/inc/unoprnms.hxx> taking other properties from here <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/include/editeng/unonames.hxx> as an example.

12101,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1So, Markus and I had the same discussion years ago.  The reason why we still keep auto_ptr there was 2 things: 1) make the code exception safe, and 2) ptr_set requires auto_ptr to be passed to be truly exception safe.  2) is a loose requirement and you can also pass a raw pointer to ptr_set (as you noticed).  But your current change is a step backward in terms of 1).The best strategy for this use case is to use o3tl::heap_ptr to replace auto_ptr, and call heap_ptr's release() when passing it to ptr_set.

12423,"Patch Set 1: (4 inline comments)1) IMHO the negative year fix should go in independently of the time zone issue.3) Why should DateTimeRange contain only one time zone, as opposed to one for   the start value and one for the end value?3) You add time zone information to dates. I don't know the meaning of that.   What would it mean, how would it behave, what would it be used for?   For example, naively, one would think that combining a date with a time,   one would get a datetime. How does one get a datetime by combining   2003-05-17+05 with 23:00-06?   FWIW, SQL does not define a DATE WITH TIME ZONE type.4) I have my doubts about time-zoned time without a date.   How do you convert 20:00+00 to time zone +10?   Just ""wrap around"" modulo 24, i.e. make it 06:00+10?   If you answer yes to that question (that is, always compute modulo 24),   then what is the difference between 06:00+11 and 06:00-13?   The difference only makes sense if one speaks of dates...   Which says that timezones don't make sense unless we know at what date   to apply them.   FWIW, SQL defines a TIME WITH TIME ZONE TYPE, *but* here's what   the PostgreSQL documentation has to say about it:   The type time with time zone is defined by the SQL standard, but the definition exhibits properties which lead to questionable usefulness. In most cases, a combination of date, time, timestamp without time zone, and timestamp with time zone should provide a complete range of date/time functionality required by any application.   (...) we recommend using date/time types that contain both date and time when using time zones. We do not recommend using the type time with time zone (though it is supported by PostgreSQL for legacy applications and for compliance with the SQL standard).I have half a mind to add timezone *only* to DateTime and DateTimeRange,not to Date and not to Time. Note that this would more-or-less eliminateall conversion problems, and ""unlock"" the scenario ""don't add timezoneto structs, but convert everything to UTC"", since conversion of datetimevalues across timezones is AFAIK well-defined. ""Convert everything to UTC""is SQL's behaviour; in SQL all non-timezoned values are assumed to be atlocal time and a date is converted to the timestamp ""same date at time 00:00"".Alternative approach to your ""isTimezoned"": have a separate struct ""DateTimeTZ""?Your ""isTimezoned"" flag should IMHO be called ""isUTC"".Do we actually *need* *any* ""unknown timezone / local timezone"" value in memory?We could just make some assumption (UTC or local TZ) on import/parse/readand store only UTC in memory. Oh, but it would be convenient for our APIs to havethe capacity to take implicitly-localTZ values, yes.If we go the ""assume that values without explicit time zone are in local time"" route,then that flag should be called ""isUTC"".So, I've spoken of what SQL does as a reference;https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/LibreOffice4#Changes_deferred_until_4.1mentions XMLSchema-2. Let's see what it does for another reference: - It (optionally) timezones everything: date, time and datetime. - I don't see a datetimerange in it. - It understands a date as a 24-hour interval   (a DateTimeRange, from date 00:00:00.00000000 to 23:59:59.999999999 for most days,    that is except for leap seconds),    while SQL seems to consider it more like an instant, time 00:00 at that day. - A value without timezone is ""unknown timezone"" and not comparable   to a value with timezone, but on the other hand, section 3.2.7 also calls   untimezoned values ""local values"", which supports the idea that they are   ""local time"". But ""local time"" is unspecified in an interchange file format,   because the file may move from one timezone to the other.   In SQL, everything is convertible/comparable because each session has an   active ""local timezone"" which is used for all untimezoned values.Pragmatically, how close to XMLSchema-2 do we need to be?1) Is there any part of ODF/OOXML/any other format where we need to import   or export a date with timezone?2) Is there any part of ODF/OOXML/any other format where we need to import   or export a time (*not* datetime) with timezone?3) Is there any part of ODF/OOXML/any other format where there can be a   datetime with timezone OR a datetime without timezone and the difference   has some semantic significance (other than ""interpret value without   timezone in this timezone"").4) Is there any part of ODF/OOXML/any other format where we need to import   or export a datetime value without timezone and preserve unmodified as   without timezone?   The kind of scenario I'm thinking of is:   We read a datetime value without timezone from some file, and the file   does not give a context that tells us what time zone to interpret that in,   the user changes stuff, but not the part with that datetime value,   *and* when saving the file again, we need to write back the same value,   as opposed to say the UTC value of that datetime-in-local-timezone   or the same datetime value with local-timezone affixed.5) Is there any part of ODF/OOXML/any other format where we need to import   or export a datetime value without timezone, do changes on it and preserve   it as without timezone?   The kind of scenario I'm thinking of is:   We read a datetime value without timezone from some file, and the file   does not give a context that tells us what time zone to interpret that in,   the user e.g. tells us ""add one hour to that datetime value"",   *and* when saving the file again, we need to write back the new value   as untimezoned, as opposed to say the UTC value of that   datetime-in-local-timezone or the same datetime value with local-timezone   affixed.",1,27499,2013-06-27 22:43:19,2013-06-28 15:39:48,16,ABANDONED,51.0,400.0,2,2,2,positive

12652,Patch Set 1:Have you looked at the code in LibreOffice4Android? IIRC that has some document chooser as well.

12658,"Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisIn general, such ifdeffed-out code should not be removed just blindly, but one should check for how long it has been ifdeffed out, and whether there is any comment indicating it is soemthing a still active developer intends to get back to, etc.In this case, I think this code might well be useful, if only we had somebody who was working on this part of the code and was interested in this self-check functionality.(Personally I have no idea what a ""job"" or ""job URL"" is.)There is a comment in joburl.cxx that says: ""It's used for internal purposes only and never a part of a legal product. Use it for testing and debug only!"" so I think it's clear that the intent is that you #define ENABLE_COMPONENT_SELF_CHECK only in your own work copy while working on this code, and that such a #define never gets into version control.Now, another question is then whether we have anybody who knows what this code does, and is interested in debugging and developing it.

12676,"Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisHi Mathias,first thanks for your patch. It is great start; Well, it does some non-standard things. I suggest to re-shufle it a bit :-)1. You already mentioned that you were unsure about    downloading the files inside configure. I suggest to   do it using the download script.   You might already see the many @FILENAME@ entries in   ooo.lst.in. They are optional. If you do not define such    variable in configure, it will be empty in the generated    ooo.lst file and it will not be downloaded.2. If you use download, it will get the files into the   $TARFILE_LOCATION instead of $SRC_ROOT/moz/zipped.      I suggest to modify the related makefiles in ""moz""    module to find the .zip archives in $TARFILE_LOCATION   Note that this approach follows the current trends.   In the past, we copied many 3rd party tarballs into   the related build subdirectories. We do not longer   do it. We already updated most makefiles to unpack the    tarballs directly from the $TARFILE_LOCATION.   3. I suggest to do not copy the dlls in configure because    it is not typical. Instead, I suggest to define variables   that will point to the files. Then you could copy the   files in the makefile that need to use the dlls.4. Please, do not remove the TABs from configure.in from    lines 4469-4515. These lines are copied into ""Makefile""    that is later tested. TABs are important in Makefiles,   so your change breaks this test.Thanks a lot for working on it. Feel free to ask if you are in doubts.",1,27953,2012-10-14 21:24:19,2012-10-14 21:24:19,0,ABANDONED,1.0,67.0,2,2,1,positive

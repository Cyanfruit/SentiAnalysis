(either redirect directly to askbot or show a overview page, depending on language. That then can be maintained/updated independently from LO (you cannot change the hardcoded URLs in a released version of LO after all)so again:* make it a generic page instead (not ""Questions and Answers"" but something like ""Get help online"" or something similar)* all URLs in LibreOffice itself should be http://hub.libreoffice.org/something ones.definite -2 because of the special handling of locales, without it it would still be a fat -1 from me",5,2702,2016/7/7 22:57,2016/7/8 23:10,24,MERGED,25,72,3,6,10,positive

Different units? I looked into its code, it seems to > pass received values directly to the notify receiver, so I don't > understand.I confirm that at least for .uno:ULSpacing values are different. And the cause is this: Take a look at SvxULSpaceItem::QueryValue and SvxULSpaceItem::PutValue. Both have nMemberId argument. If it's 0, the value is read/write without conversion, but if it's CONVERT_TWIPS then the value is converted from/to 1/100th mm.Now, when the original SfxPoolItem is converted to the UNO status thing, that conversion is made (as documented in offapi/com/sun/star/frame/status/UpperLowerMarginScale.idl ...) - see SfxDispatcher::QueryState and SfxDispatchController_Impl::StateChanged. But when this is used in SfxToolBoxControl::statusChanged to re-construct the SfxPoolItem, there is simply hardcoded 0 passed to SfxPoolItem::PutValue. Of course this doesn't affect ControllerItem, because it gets the original SfxPoolItem from sfx2.",3,3856,2016/5/31 14:57,2016/6/8 17:10,194,MERGED,12,1312,3,7,14,negative

It does not affect how other code handles it. Of course if we get a lot of SEH excepions from outside of our control that are currently caught in one of the catch all handlers we are going to crash a lot.EHs has basically two effects on the code. catch(...) will not catch SEH exceptions and there is no stack nwinding and destructor calls going to be for SEH exceptions.I think both are fine in our code. The case that some external part is handling SEH with EHa should not concern us as if we get a SEH from that cod ewe will just crash and if that code handles it we are not going to see it anyway.,2,4026,2016/6/20 7:02,2016/6/20 13:55,6,MERGED,9,70,5,9,2,positive

But i don't > know how can i handle it.It has a switch where you can handle the commands similar to the Execute method, but this time for the command state. A state of a command is how the UI element (toolbar button, menu item etc.) that bound to this command presented to the user. It can be enabled/disabled, checked/unchecked, its text can dynamically change etc.wrt our case, I see that .uno:FreezePanes is enabled always, even in a read-only doc, and so should be the new commands, so this isn't an issue. What GetState currently does for .uno:FreezePanes is that it sets checked/unchecked state. But I wonder whether we want something similar for the new commands (i.e. detect if the first row/column is frozen and set checked state accordingly), or maybe such indication isn't that useful, and we can just drop the GetState part from tabvwsh.sdi as well.Eike: What do you think on this?",13,7632,2016/1/19 14:32,2016/1/26 10:59,164,MERGED,12,332,4,8,16,negative

For example the code now expects 3 cases: nextmessage, single-line, and a 3rd undocumented case.Please add the const (see note) and I'll submit this patch, then we need to review the protocol(.txt) and the code and make sure we have a solid situation.

It's basic functionality to convert SVG XML to ODF XML is a good basic functionality, the only reasons to 'park' it now and not to invest more work is that SVGIO is capable of more features, that the XML conversion is limited in getting perfect due to ODF restrictions and that it is too much work to develop both.

My first attempt  already broke the Redline handling (which Michael fixed by reverting my patch).Not sure if I should start an other attempt on the single-node copy and an additional parameter to prevent node merging in case of document copying...But since I had to rely on the special semantics of CopyRange here, this results in an additional node compared to the originally intended CopyRange behavior.This patch actually fixes the crash for me and correctly copies the bookmarks.

I tried that. And can give it another try. But it would require a much bigger change, obviously. The main problem is that wingdi.h is actually included from other windows headers too. So we can't fully control when it's included. But can give it another shot and narrow it down further.

But my change will neither help nor harm that case :)(I only fixed the reverse, which is that wingdi.h is included before Common.hxx.)And I believe that case doesn't exist now (if they existed, I fixed them).Containing windows headers in postwin.h will help (which I fully support). But even then, once a header that includes wingdi.h (directly or indirectly) is included in the pch, then we still face the same issue. So it's really tricky.Since I was working on pch files, it was this latter case that really made things complicated. The way to avoid that is to never include an uncontained header that leaks in the pch, which is what we do. So the only case that breaks the build is when RGB is defined before Office/Common.hxx, which I patched.Actually, I think what we should do is add #undef RGB to postwin.h (even when currently it's not needed).

All the code that is behind the *MSO* flags in the chart2/source/view/* code will only be hit for documents that have been saved by MSO.None of these code paths will be hit if the same document has been saved by LibreOffice.Additionally I consider the idea to put such code into the chart2/source/view/* the worst idea since the decision to use UNO inside chart2/*. The chart2/source/view code should never ever contain checks for the file format and even less for the producer of the file.At least I would never accept such code inside of chart2.,2,10358,2015/7/31 20:14,2015/9/28 9:22,1405,MERGED,14,172,4,6,5,negative

Someone else has to do that.If this fix is otherwise acceptable, I'd push it even without handling the corner case. It stops the bleeding and helps the users.

I mentioned this somewhere as a limitation. The reason for this is that the page size is the same, but the margins are removed/reduced. So the text is allowed to fill in more surface area. This could be solved by changing the page dimensions in hide-whitespace mode. I didn't try to do that, again, to get initial feedback. > In case i didnt mention it before, i am part of the design and UX > teams. :DFantastic!

Good to know. The reason I wrote this script is because I have another patch that improves pch generation (a rewrite of update_pch in python that updates every single pch in the codebase in a few seconds). It was obvious to me that to improve the pch generation to make builds faster I had to deal with the problem of conflicting headers (that are excluded from pch) and required headers (that will break the build if left out). This script solves the latter problem, so now what is included in pch headers is purely to accelerate builds, not to prevent the build from breaking.Will submit the update_pch script and updated pch files sometime soon, as time permits.",1,11103,2015/9/1 0:33,2015/9/1 0:33,0,MERGED,16,378,4,6,2,negative

I only submitted when I was confident enough that they won't cause immediate instability (evident from the commit message and the test design/code). What I'm saying in the message is that there are no strong guarantees from the OS, and the tests _can_ fail (doesn't mean _will_ fail). I just don't know how often.

I think all that is required is to adjust http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/basic/source/classes/sbxmod.cxx#1809 (or get rid of that method and adjust the caller (in scriptcont) to pass the current binary format versionplease see https://bz.apache.org/ooo/show_bug.cgi?id=64377needless to say that stuff needs to be retested too (but it would be good to get it in)It is of course possible to juggle the version numbers (and code) in such away to implement just this new update to the binary format (and skip enabling aoo#64377) that's fine too, but... I think a version bump in necessary in anycase",5,11517,2015/8/17 11:28,2015/8/18 9:50,22,MERGED,3,194,1,1,5,negative

Any chance you can create one ? > Thanks !Depends what you mean by ""work."" The timers of course _do_ work, but that is not the problem I'm fixing. I'm fixing the issue with high idle CPU utilization. Periodic timers should reset their start time so that they re-fire only after the duration has expired. The issue, I found, is that Timer thinks it's ready to fire again at the next tick. Ticks come in for the _soonest_ next timer delay (this is because we really have only one system timer callback, and we need it to fire for the next timer in the queue). In the worst case they come in immediately (after 1ms) and in those cases Timer thinks it's ready to fire again, which it does. This doesn't cause any obvious problems, other than CPU utilization where there shouldn't be any (because Timer handles background jobs, like spellchecking, which wastes some CPU and returns, but the waste is proportional to the document size and number of documents open).It is clear from the code that nowhere is the start-time reset. Of course I had the luxury of debugging and seeing what was happening, but the code and my comments make it almost trivial to trace the variable in question and see that without changing it, it will trick Timer into firing again. (See Timer::ReadyForSchedule where mnUpdateTime is used.)I can add unittest for this but, from experience, timers are not reliable enough to trap them within a reasonable time frame from make the test meaningful. On a non-realtime OS, they come with no guarantees. And they are less consistent across a number of OSes. We can have a crude ""test fire once"" and ""test don't fire too soon"" but it's harder to have ""fired too late."" Also, it's much harder to simulate the myriads of jobs we have and the arbitrary periods of each (and how they overlap).I'll give it a shot, but applying and running a large document with this 1 liner will show that the idle CPU utilization does go to 0.",5,11525,2015/7/19 17:33,2015/7/20 0:08,6,MERGED,1,3,5,7,5,negative

Also in ScFormulaCfg::ImplCommit() CONV_A1_XL_A1 is not handled.In sc/source/filter/oox/workbookhelper.cxx in WorkbookGlobals::initialize() has aCalcConfig.meStringRefAddressSyntax = getConvention(xDocProps); where getConvention() returns CONV_OOO if the generator was not Microsoft.

At line number 2340, in this method, pImp->m_pInstream is populated from pImp->xStream rather than pImp->xInputStream due to the order of if-else statements. I think that pImp->xStream is uncompressed as I did not set MediaDescriptor::PROP_STREAM property in media descriptor in the detect code.The csv import dialog uses the xInputStream directly where as the ScDocShell::ConvertFrom() uses SvStream from SfxMedium::GetInStream()I tried to reverse the order of if-else statement in SfxMedium::GetMedium_Impl() (starting at line number 2340). But soon realized that it is not correct as1) it breaks some unit tests (import of pdf files failed)2) Though the spreadsheet now shows uncompressed data, the csv import dialog shows empty data !. I thought it was due to file stream position set to the end, but seeking the pImp->xInputStream to the beginning did not solve that.So I reverted this change and instead tried assigning to both MediaDescriptor::PROP_STREAM and MediaDescriptor::PROP_INPUTSTREAM properties in the textdetect filter code as follows :uno::Reference<io::XStream> xStreamDecompressed(new utl::OStreamWrapper(*pDecompressedStream));                                                                                                    aMediaDesc[MediaDescriptor::PROP_STREAM()] <<= xStreamDecompressed;                                                                                                                                aMediaDesc[MediaDescriptor::PROP_INPUTSTREAM()] <<= xStreamDecompressed->getInputStream();This change seems to work, no unit test failed, and uncompressed data in both spreadsheet and csv import dialog.

That's why I did it in a more conservative way, putting it in import tests.It is my concern that numbering types are not one to one mapping. A sequence like import, export, import lose information by nature. For example there are many cases fallback into NUMBER_LOWER_ZH. However it seems that the patchset for rtfexport can compile ( did it ever make check? ) , It contradict my guess.",3,15875,2014/11/8 15:45,2014/11/9 21:42,29,MERGED,10,104,3,6,3,negative
3230,"Patch Set 3:When designing the framework, we had two basic ideas:- interesting document models are easier to be loaded from some format, than building them from code- checking an in-memory document model is reasonably easy (usually by using the UNO API), at least easier than asserting a written file (think of manually checking a binary .doc result)That's why for export tests, we do an import->export->import sequence. That ensures that the doc. models can be still stored in a file, allows asserting the result using the UNO API, and still export problems are detected. (I'm just re-stating what's in sw/qa/extras/README, just in case for some reason that file is not clear.) Hopefully this makes it clear how export tests are done. :-)Regarding loosing data during import/export: sure, sometimes that's necessary when e.g. our numbering types and MSO's numbering types do not match. In your case, the provided tests passed just fine when also the exporter got included in the chain, that's why I changed that. As long as it passes, it's safe to change, and it ensures that your export improvements won't break in the future silently. ;-)",3,15875,2014/11/8 15:45,2014/11/9 21:42,29,MERGED,10,104,3,6,3,positive

4413,"Patch Set 1:> Please try to provide atomic changes instead of all-in-one commit.This is an atomic commit. Splitting that up would result in unbuildable project/mix of abs and android support lib. Not what you want.And did you even bother to look at the patch? All those changes are trivial, basically replacing ""Sherlock"" with ""Compat"" or similar> First, you are changing minimum SDK version we are not interested in ÔÇö there is a sweet ICS future, it is more wise to move forward instead of backward.Changing the minimum version doesn't impact use of new ICS features at all. That's what the support libraries are for. ActionBarSherlock previously, and the default android support library in the proposal.You fail to mention what ICS features are lost by that, so please elaborate. And of course one doesn't need to lower it - but why artificially limiting the usable devices when there is no reason?> Second, changing target SDK should be supported via build servers to not fail.No idea what you mean by that. Target SDK is the version that is definitely supported, i.e. in this case the version that runs on a device I personally own, did personally test with. But again, no biggie to leave that at present values.> Third, we are not interested at moment in switching from ABS to ABCWho is ""we""?> because LO Android port uses ABS anyway and,How is the LO Android port related to the Impress Remote? The remote(s) have already been decoupled translation wise, release-schedule wise, so I fail to see how the remote is bound to the Android port.Again the changes are small, the android support libraries stack up easily to support newer features.You mentioned that newer versions have nice features and you'd rather drop support for older devices: using the android support libs makes that easy. In Fact the ABS one already used the v4 support library itself.> again, this should be supported via build servers.And again no idea what you mean by that. If you mean it should be buildable by ant/using the makefiles and not by using Eclipse, you should see that I also updated the makefile.I didn't bother to add a check whether the v7 support library has been installed on the machine, as it is not built as part of LO anyway, and the error message will be pretty obvious in that case....If you insist, I can also add configure checks. Or do the easy way as with the abs and check it into the repo.> Fourth, SettingsActivity after your change wouldnÔÇÖt have an action bar on pre-Honeycomb versions.It will.> I agree with you that ABS ÔåÆ ABC migration makes sense but there is a *really low* percentage of users using Gingerbread.I didn't change it because I wanted to lower the minimumSDK, that was just the result of the lint check that this is the minimum that the code uses.> It makes a very little sense for me to swap dependencies for things that just work for platform version which *potentially* could be dropped.I don't care about the minimum SDK, so don't fixate on that.  I did swap dependencies for the contrary, to make it easier to extend later with new features. Even the author of the ABS wrote that ABS has done its job, that with the android support lib v7 there is no reason to use ABS anymore. That of course doesn't mean one should swap components, never change a running system yadda,yadda, but the remote is small, the change as a whole is small, so it is (IMHO) a sensible thing to do.You also state on the one-hand pre honeycomb (aka gingerbread) would look different, but on the other hand you're willing to just drop support for gingerbread completely.

6687,"Patch Set 3:> Lionel, any response to Michael's review?So, in general terms, the situation is that I stumbledupon broken code while doing something else and Ifixed it. Details:>> possibly this could be replaced by sax::ConverterYes, that seems desirable in the middle-to-long term.However, the name of the function referred to anotherstandard than what sax::Converter aims at, so I consideredit more prudent to fix the code ""locally"", referring to thestandard it purposes to implement, rather than replaceby a call to sax::Converter::parseISO8601 (or some such).Especially since I meant for this to go into our release branch(es).If someone wants to invest the time to merge this withsax::Converter, I agree it would enhance the code qualityof LibreOffice: one (hopefully not buggy) implementationof parsing date/time (that is well-tested because used much,tested by unittests, etc) instead of multiple implementationswith different bugs that possibly show up only in corner cases(and thus linger for a long time before being found).However, that someone is not me, at least not in the shortterm. > I had a look at ""ECMA-376 Part 1 3rd edition"" > (is this the relevant reference?)Dunno. Not my area of expertise. Looks plausible to me. > ST_DateTime (...) W3C XML Schema dateTime datatype > Dates and Time (...) SpreadsheetML (...) ISO 8601-formatted > string > Date (...) SpreadsheetML (...) stored in the ISO 8601 format > however can't find any reference to > http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime in there > where did the idea come from that that was relevant?The function is called GetDateTimeFromW3CDTF. Duckduckgoing(or Googling) for W3CDTF makes it clear that ""W3CDTF"" usuallymeans http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime, so I assumed thatthis was the format the function was supposed to parse. 1) Was the W3CDTF in the function name meant as a reference     to that note? Dunno, ask its author. 2) In that case, was the reference itself an error? Michael's     research seems to indicate this would be the case.IRC (or mailing list?) discussion also basically said that as faras we know, the timezone component of this fix may not mattermuch since Microsoft Office always writes UTC (Zulu) time,so the bug would never get triggered. I think that it is stillpreferable to fix the bug to avoid that other code calls thisfunction in situations where the bug happens.So, my opinion would be:1) As proactive safety, apply this patch to master & 4-1.    (possibly an adapted part of it to 4-0; adapted because    sub-second stuff is different in 4-0: centiseconds instead    of nanoseconds) 2) In master, provided we have a volunteer to unravel that     quagmire (that knows about OOXML or willing to find out     about it), merge with sax::Converter date/time-parsing     if appropriate... If not appropriate, maybe migrate this     function to sax::Converter (along with documentation-by-     comment explaining why we need different parsers for     different formats and the difference between them), so     that our date/time-parsing code is all in one place.Since nobody clearly vetoed this patch, I'm going to push ""1)"" to master soon, unless someone vetoes.",3,21753,2013/7/5 15:12,2013/8/9 6:59,831,MERGED,1,56,2,5,4,negative

11288,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1(1 comment)The idea to merge the two threads (callback handler and tile rendering) is reasonable, but we should discuss the approach.The starvation you noticed happens because you are using the tile-queue, which is designed for... well, yes, tiles! :)It reorders the messages such that it renders tiles in large blocks first. So with heavy typing the callback messages always end up getting overtaken by tiles, which the queue explicitly favors, thereby starving callback events.So this is one problem with the current implementation. I think the tiles should have its own queue, and callbacks a separate one. The thread that pumps them would process one callback, then one tile-rendering.Another issue with combining these threads is that there will be reduction in performance. This is because before and after rendering a tile there is significant work being done that does *not* execute with the Solar lock. This code (mostly encoding to PNG) is CPU intensive and can run in parallel to other code (even to other rendering calls).Finally, I have submitted my patch (342125b8ea) to fix the missing tiles issue. Should be easier to read than describe it here (it's only +27, -6). It comes with detailed commit log too. So this approach is mostly an optimization to reduce the thread-count, but, as mentioned, we need multiple threads because we have opportunity to parallelize, and merging them will reduce performance (unless benchmark proves otherwise, of course).",1,25170,2016/9/22 19:59,2016/9/22 20:49,0,ABANDONED,1,163,2,4,1,negative
11289,"Patch Set 1:Wrt. the starvation - actually that was due to the logging; we have so much debugging stuff that it was blocking considerably when writing to the console, making the queue grow.  Without that, all works fine even with the unmodified TileQueue :-)But I worked on the TileQueue too - it seems unnecessary to do all the priority shuffling when inserting, when the prioritization changes with every view switch, and instead do it only when the tile is requested - which seems to work nicely.Wrt. an own queue for tiles - that is exactly the thing that makes the synchronzation hard, as then it is necessary to synchronize between those 2 queues; which in turn kills all the advantage of 2 queues :-)Wrt. PNG compression; if we want to thread it, then let's thread just the compression - that'll make it local, more maintainable, and we can go with as many threads there as we wish (for just the PNG compression piece of code).Wrt. the 342125b8ea - thanks for that!

11437,Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1(2 comments)So there are my two purely coding style related comments but also one about memory corruption that I need to think about.I think some dispose calls are wrong and might cause access to deleted objects.

11438,Patch Set 3: Code-Review-2I have to change my -1 to a -2. The code in XMLTableMasterPageExport.cxx is wrong. The lifecycle is messed up by these dispose calls on objects returned from getPropertyValue.This either leads to bugs (the object has been destroyed while it should not and therefore we have empty references) or even worse to access to deleted memory. Both cases are not something that I want to see in a backport.Another point is that instead of the normal public dispose methods these classes should inherit from XComponent. I'm not a fan of UNO myself but reinventing a new way to break cyclic references will only lead to problems later.Now for a way forward we need to fix the problems mentioned here and if it is safe enough we can think about a backport again.

11471,"Patch Set 1:Hi Kendy,Please look into this and tell me if it is the right way to proceed.This throws the Unknown Property Exception as indicated below.I think we may need to call this setPropertyValue() <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/editeng/source/uno/unofield.cxx#675> instead of the one currently being called <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sw/source/core/unocore/unofield.cxx#2152> which is throwing up an Unknown Property Exception at <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sw/source/core/unocore/unofield.cxx#2165> One is sw's implementation while the other is editeng's implementation. Moggi was of the opinion that the setPropertyValue() from editeng couldn't be called here. But the current one is unable to support that property (UNO_TC_PROP_TEXTFIELD_TYPE). How would it be possible to proceed?I'm influenced by this comment <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/offapi/com/sun/star/text/textfield/Type.idl#19> when I say the above.Also, I did a '#define UNO_NAME_TEXT_FIELD_TYPE ""TextFieldType""' in <opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sw/inc/unoprnms.hxx> taking other properties from here <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/include/editeng/unonames.hxx> as an example. But I'm unsure if this is the right way to proceed.Since I've mentioned '[optional, property]long TextFieldType;' as optional in <opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/offapi/com/sun/star/text/textfield/ExtendedUser.idl>, I might need a boolean to indicate when 'setPropertyValue()' must be called for each of the fields from <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/offapi/com/sun/star/text/textfield/Type.idl> in here <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/xmloff/source/text/txtfldi.cxx#706>. I don't think we need to call it for all 15 properties all the time. How do I use the boolean variable - like for example - how do I use it to indicate when to set EXTENDED_TIME and when not to..?Regarding the comment thread on the bug page - you'd asked what happens when I run it without removing certain stuff from content.xml . The exact same exceptions are thrown in the order of Comment 13 first and then Comment 14.On a side note, I would like to say that I'm doing this coz you'd asked me to work on LO code (with respect to GSoC) and this was a bug reported by you. Since you didn't remember filing this bug, if there is something else that you'd want me to work on, please do tell.I would have loved to work on creating MAR files (from onlineupdate module), and still do think that's the best thing to do as it would mean I would get a headstart when it comes to the actual coding period begin dates, and had sent a mail to you regarding that. But on not receivng a reply, I'd assumed you didn't want me to work on that. Please do indicate what you think I should be working on.Thanks :-)",1,25556,2016/4/4 14:12,2016/4/4 14:12,0,ABANDONED,5,23,4,20,1,positive

I was a bit upset that the headless patch was merged even though the ESC asked the author not to merge it in its current form. The opengl situation on our Android port is a bit unclear. On one hand, we disable opengl in configure, OTOH it seems we build most of the opengl code in vcl. My commit just restored that status quo, fixing the build. I also verified that the build result actually works. :-)Given that at the end Android uses cairo to render the tiles, the opengl code is not useful on Android. However, probably it's a good idea to not work on removing it from the Android binary till it's not clear if those opengl #ifdefs will go away or not in the long run.

11525,Patch Set 1:(1 comment)So this is going to be an ugly one.We are now hitting a limitation of the current test framework. Currently all our tests don't have access to the UI configuration as it breaks the tests. Now I don't remember why I went the way of pointing the ui path to the user profile but it still seems to be necessary. Back when I wrote that code there were however no UI files so it was still so that the whole UI should have worked. Now with the UI files this is no longer true and pointing the UI config path to a place that does not the UI files causes an exception and later a crash.I will need some time to get back into the details of the configuration management during the tests.,1,25668,2016/3/21 14:48,2016/3/21 14:48,0,ABANDONED,3,60,3,7,2,negative

12423,"Patch Set 1: (4 inline comments)1) IMHO the negative year fix should go in independently of the time zone issue.3) Why should DateTimeRange contain only one time zone, as opposed to one for   the start value and one for the end value?3) You add time zone information to dates. I don't know the meaning of that.   What would it mean, how would it behave, what would it be used for?   For example, naively, one would think that combining a date with a time,   one would get a datetime. How does one get a datetime by combining   2003-05-17+05 with 23:00-06?   FWIW, SQL does not define a DATE WITH TIME ZONE type.4) I have my doubts about time-zoned time without a date.   How do you convert 20:00+00 to time zone +10?   Just ""wrap around"" modulo 24, i.e. make it 06:00+10?   If you answer yes to that question (that is, always compute modulo 24),   then what is the difference between 06:00+11 and 06:00-13?   The difference only makes sense if one speaks of dates...   Which says that timezones don't make sense unless we know at what date   to apply them.   FWIW, SQL defines a TIME WITH TIME ZONE TYPE, *but* here's what   the PostgreSQL documentation has to say about it:   The type time with time zone is defined by the SQL standard, but the definition exhibits properties which lead to questionable usefulness. In most cases, a combination of date, time, timestamp without time zone, and timestamp with time zone should provide a complete range of date/time functionality required by any application.   (...) we recommend using date/time types that contain both date and time when using time zones. We do not recommend using the type time with time zone (though it is supported by PostgreSQL for legacy applications and for compliance with the SQL standard).I have half a mind to add timezone *only* to DateTime and DateTimeRange,not to Date and not to Time. Note that this would more-or-less eliminateall conversion problems, and ""unlock"" the scenario ""don't add timezoneto structs, but convert everything to UTC"", since conversion of datetimevalues across timezones is AFAIK well-defined. ""Convert everything to UTC""is SQL's behaviour; in SQL all non-timezoned values are assumed to be atlocal time and a date is converted to the timestamp ""same date at time 00:00"".Alternative approach to your ""isTimezoned"": have a separate struct ""DateTimeTZ""?Your ""isTimezoned"" flag should IMHO be called ""isUTC"".Do we actually *need* *any* ""unknown timezone / local timezone"" value in memory?We could just make some assumption (UTC or local TZ) on import/parse/readand store only UTC in memory. Oh, but it would be convenient for our APIs to havethe capacity to take implicitly-localTZ values, yes.If we go the ""assume that values without explicit time zone are in local time"" route,then that flag should be called ""isUTC"".So, I've spoken of what SQL does as a reference;https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/LibreOffice4#Changes_deferred_until_4.1mentions XMLSchema-2. Let's see what it does for another reference: - It (optionally) timezones everything: date, time and datetime. - I don't see a datetimerange in it. - It understands a date as a 24-hour interval   (a DateTimeRange, from date 00:00:00.00000000 to 23:59:59.999999999 for most days,    that is except for leap seconds),    while SQL seems to consider it more like an instant, time 00:00 at that day. - A value without timezone is ""unknown timezone"" and not comparable   to a value with timezone, but on the other hand, section 3.2.7 also calls   untimezoned values ""local values"", which supports the idea that they are   ""local time"". But ""local time"" is unspecified in an interchange file format,   because the file may move from one timezone to the other.   In SQL, everything is convertible/comparable because each session has an   active ""local timezone"" which is used for all untimezoned values.Pragmatically, how close to XMLSchema-2 do we need to be?1) Is there any part of ODF/OOXML/any other format where we need to import   or export a date with timezone?2) Is there any part of ODF/OOXML/any other format where we need to import   or export a time (*not* datetime) with timezone?3) Is there any part of ODF/OOXML/any other format where there can be a   datetime with timezone OR a datetime without timezone and the difference   has some semantic significance (other than ""interpret value without   timezone in this timezone"").4) Is there any part of ODF/OOXML/any other format where we need to import   or export a datetime value without timezone and preserve unmodified as   without timezone?   The kind of scenario I'm thinking of is:   We read a datetime value without timezone from some file, and the file   does not give a context that tells us what time zone to interpret that in,   the user changes stuff, but not the part with that datetime value,   *and* when saving the file again, we need to write back the same value,   as opposed to say the UTC value of that datetime-in-local-timezone   or the same datetime value with local-timezone affixed.5) Is there any part of ODF/OOXML/any other format where we need to import   or export a datetime value without timezone, do changes on it and preserve   it as without timezone?   The kind of scenario I'm thinking of is:   We read a datetime value without timezone from some file, and the file   does not give a context that tells us what time zone to interpret that in,   the user e.g. tells us ""add one hour to that datetime value"",   *and* when saving the file again, we need to write back the new value   as untimezoned, as opposed to say the UTC value of that   datetime-in-local-timezone or the same datetime value with local-timezone   affixed.",1,27499,2013/6/27 22:43,2013/6/28 15:39,16,ABANDONED,51,400,2,2,2,positive

I think http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/commit/?id=98f56121858b4bea54d056a073005a10648785c6 should work instead.In MultiSalLayout::GetBoundRect we loop through each fallback font and union each level's GetBoundRect to get the result, which seems reasonable, except that for each level that's means a call to SalLayout::GetBoundRect which calls X11SalGraphics::GetGlyphBoundRect.Those sublevels SalLayouts don't know that they are sublevels so they never set the level bits on their glyphs. Which results in X11SalGraphics::GetGlyphBoundRect always searching for that glyph in the level 0 font, so there's a mismatch between the font the SalLayout's are created to use and the font that gets used.Now, SalLayout::GetBoundRect is a fairly simple thing, it just calls GetNextGlyphs 1 by 1 and X11SalGraphics::GetGlyphBoundRect on the result of that.  So I *think* that if we remove the specialized MultiSalLayout::GetBoundRect in favour of the default implementation, then because MultiSalLayout::GetNextGlyphs is specialized to do-the-right-thing and set up the glyph ids correctly, then we bubble the ids down to X11SalGraphics::GetGlyphBoundRect correctly to get it to use the right font and we get the correct bounding size.",3,27824,2013/1/16 13:26,2013/1/16 13:33,0,ABANDONED,1,21,2,3,3,negative

12676,"Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisHi Mathias,first thanks for your patch. It is great start; Well, it does some non-standard things. I suggest to re-shufle it a bit :-)1. You already mentioned that you were unsure about    downloading the files inside configure. I suggest to   do it using the download script.   You might already see the many @FILENAME@ entries in   ooo.lst.in. They are optional. If you do not define such    variable in configure, it will be empty in the generated    ooo.lst file and it will not be downloaded.2. If you use download, it will get the files into the   $TARFILE_LOCATION instead of $SRC_ROOT/moz/zipped.      I suggest to modify the related makefiles in ""moz""    module to find the .zip archives in $TARFILE_LOCATION   Note that this approach follows the current trends.   In the past, we copied many 3rd party tarballs into   the related build subdirectories. We do not longer   do it. We already updated most makefiles to unpack the    tarballs directly from the $TARFILE_LOCATION.   3. I suggest to do not copy the dlls in configure because    it is not typical. Instead, I suggest to define variables   that will point to the files. Then you could copy the   files in the makefile that need to use the dlls.4. Please, do not remove the TABs from configure.in from    lines 4469-4515. These lines are copied into ""Makefile""    that is later tested. TABs are important in Makefiles,   so your change breaks this test.Thanks a lot for working on it.

12699,"Patch Set 1: AbandonedEike Rathke is right. This patch introduces a performance regression and this is not acceptable. Anyway, there is a merge conflict and fixing it was not worth the effort since this is only a minor rewrite. The goal was to do a firts timer job in the code base before doing a more in depth contribution. So I am going to the next step :)",1,28005,2012/7/22 2:50,2012/7/22 2:50,0,ABANDONED,7,325,3,4,1,negative

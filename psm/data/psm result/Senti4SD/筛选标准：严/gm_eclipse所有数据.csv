Even paying attention to copyright statements.This change certainly cuts neatly through a bunch of unnecessary and wonky code.  I was going to complain that changing the APIs in the UI classes from working with URIs to working with IResources results in a loss of generality, so that it would be more difficult to support exporting diagrams to the host filesystem (which is desperately needed, IMO) or other destinations, and that IResource is not even as appropriate a type as IContainer, but then I observed that the entire export infrastructure beneath the UI is all pinned to the IResource contract, anyways.  That, combined with the fact that any clients trying to use these UI bits would have had to construct nonsense URIs, means that I don't mind that this technically is an API-breaking change because that API was already non-functional and it will have to break again some time anyways to support exporting to non-workspace destinations.  Besides that none of these UI classes should ever have been exposed as API to begin with.All of which is to say thanks for working through the contribution process and do come back for more.",1,970,2016-10-13 21:08:40,2016-10-13 21:08:40,0,MERGED,5.0,118.0,4,5,1,negative

Are we supposed to import only the top-level releng/ folder into the workspace as a project, or the individual nested folders within it?  The actual formulation of these include URIs depends in any case (whether relative or absolute platform:/resource URIs) on how the projects are imported.  I would be much happier if we could just eliminate the confusion by not using nested projects at all so that everybody imports the projects in the same way and the include references work for everybody.",2,1186,2016-09-21 18:02:01,2016-09-21 19:48:33,1,MERGED,6.0,27.0,4,17,3,positive

I can add it but then the warning will arise that the first line of the commit message is too long. :) > Should we change the reference to org.eclipse.equinox.event in > org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.addons.swt.test too?IMHO yes, and everywhere it was added just to satisfy the test-runtime. In the ticket Markus also says that there are similar issues in JDT builds. But we can add it to this commit for the platform. But it looks like in the platform this is the last remaining direct Require-Bundle entry. > Should all bundles with a Service-Component add a Require-Capability > on osgi.extender?Yes I think so. There was a contribution about this in the past, but it didn't work that time because p2 doesn't support OSGi capabilities.

758,"Patch Set 4:> Wow - this was really close. I tested this on Windows and already > typed in my +2 message. Only picking up one cup of coffee saved us > from accidentily submitting thisI still think this fix is the right thing to do, not closing resource is never a good idea but this change is defeating the RepositoryCache creator original intent, which I think was to keep stuff around as long as possible by using SoftReference.I tested this series and so far the memory consumption drastically improved because the RepositoryCache is no longer slowly growing but I can see that the disk IO increased and performance degraded in operations involving many repositories, like listing projects in Gerrit (ls-projects command).Relying on the SoftReference mechanism to evict old unused repository is not a good idea because the eviction becomes unpredictable. For example, our Gerrit master JVM heap is set to 58GB, the old generation space(Tenured Generation) is 44GB which leaves 14GB for the eden and survivor spaces. The old generation space eventually becomes full (mostly by the caches including the unbound RepositoryCache) and then the application starts slowing down because GC keeps kicking in. The SoftReference are still not being collected at that point because the buffer of available memory is not bellow the threshold that would make GC consider the SoftReference.All this to say that I will do more testing on our production server but if it turns out that the performance impact is too big, I(we) will need to consider reimplementing the RepositoryCache to achieve the goal of keeping repository in memory but without being forever (I am not sure yet what would be the eviction criteria).",4,3100,2015-09-04 19:32:28,2015-09-18 19:27:35,335,MERGED,3.0,30.0,3,7,6,negative

884,"Patch Set 7:> ""allowNulls"", the design of the state system is that there should be no null values when returning from a query. It's not explicitely enforced in the backends' runtime code, but it could be. Testing this means testing cases that are not supposed to happen.When used along with a StateSystem, the query does not return null because the StateSystem first fills the interval list with a subset of the intervals and the backend fills it with the remaining subset, and both subsets complete each other and are mutually exclusive. So it is perfectly valid and expected in our runtime implementation that a backend does not fill some of the elements in the interval list. I could easily foresee test cases asserting that some elements must be null in the result of a query. These assertions could be checked after executing testDoQuery() which should therefore complete without failing.> The two ""abstract"" methods (getBackendForBuilding/getBackendForQuerying). The concept of ""reopening"" only applies to the HistoryTreeBackend, this notion should remain in that test class, not in the -Base. Parameters and the ""reopen"" constructor parameter is a nice way to offer both alternatives.Any backend could support reopening and then should override getBackendForQuerying(). Those backends that don't support it don't have to do anything. I think this is perfectly fine. My solution has the advantage to reduce code duplication. In the context of unit test code, I believe this is more important than conceptual considerations.> The abstract method I'm suggesting tells the implementation to ""create a backend and insert these intervals"". This is a clear initialization step.This clear initialization method is implemented in a final protected method that performs these steps in the base class in my patch. I think it is much better.> The pattern of an abstract method to set a protected field is used in other tests. It should be kept as consistent as possible.I hope you are not suggesting that forcing all subclasses to implement a method that can more easily be provided by the base class is preferable for reasons of consistency.I therefore respectfully disagree with your remaining objections. I think this patch is now way, way above the review threshold for unit test code.

This fixes my most serious concern in regard to honoring the IProgressConstants2.SHOW_IN_TASKBAR_ICON_PROPERTY flag.(b) I can confirm that the system task bar is *not* yet triggered during the RCP startup process, there exists two reasons for this:(b.1) Previous 3.x Workbench code did enter in WorkbenchAdvisor.openWindows() a different code branch, because the lineIStatus status = myConfigurer[0].restoreState();could give a not-OK-status, this is no longer possible, because now WorkbenchConfigurer.restoreState() *always* returns OK_STATUS.(b.2) Now Workbench.createAndRunWorkbench does not wrap the splash handlers progress monitor using TaskBarDelegatingProgressMonitor.(b.3) My test program omits to set SHOW_PROGRESS_ON_STARTUP=true in the plugin_customization.iniTherefore my action items for this week end are:- Upload an improved test program that ensures that the startup presents progress on startup- Try to fix the second unwrapped progress monitorMy most serious concerns for this issue are fixing to honor IProgressConstants2.SHOW_IN_TASKBAR_ICON_PROPERTY.

1050,"Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1Seems to work on MacOS for valid links. Apparently also for broken links.However, I'm extremely wary of having these links editable in the compare editor. I get very strange things and follow-up errors if I edit a link in the compare editor and make it invalid in doing so.And I didn't even try to do really bad things, like setting the link content to multiple lines of text.In particular:0. Start off with a valid link in the workspace, pointing to another file in the workspace. (Link created with ln -s in shell, committed in shell, then pulled in EGit.)1. Select ""Context menu->Compare with index"" and edit the workspace link's contents (append a zero to make it invalid -- assuming there is no such file). Save.2. Link is shown in staging view as deleted. cgit git status reports it as modified.3. Stage and commit the broken link in EGit. 4. On disk, the broken link is still there! No error logged. Compare editor remains open. cgit reports the broken link suddenly as untracked.5. Do a ""Reset Hard"" on the parent commit. Now the valid link does not re-appear in package explorer. Even worse, it's gone on disk! cgit git status reports it as a staged deletion, and so does EGit's staging view. If I do the hard reset instead using cgit, the link is restored fine. Looks like EGit/JGit cannot restore a valid link if the workspace contains a broken link in that place.Other case:0: Start off with a valid top-level valid link (top-level is not in workspace) pointing to a file inside a project.1. On disk, break the link by doing ln -s doesntexist.txt link.txt2. In Eclipse, refresh staging view.2. Link is shown in git staging view as unstaged modification. Agrees with cgit.3.

1155,"Patch Set 4:(1 comment)Gabor, the latest patches of JDT Core and UI seem to be working quite well at a first glance. I am yet to test the feature properly. Before that, please have a look at the following as well:- It is not working for type names, e.g. when you type a substring of a class name to declare a field.- The relevance / proposal order is mixed up when fields are proposed with types. Example:public class C {	int intField;	String stringField;	{		field|	}}- In case of methods, the substring is also matched in its parameters, return type, declaring type etc. I think it should be restricted to only the method name.- Filtering of the results still seems to have some issue. Not sure if the filtered results look confusing or non-relevant due to the above issue of not restricting the match to just the name or if it is due to the non-subsequent matching. We can check that once the above issue is fixed. Also, pattern highlighting in the proposal will be very useful with this feature. Please check if it is simple to implement. Otherwise, we can do that later.",4,4800,2015-07-14 13:11:53,2015-07-27 12:12:26,311,MERGED,4.0,62.0,3,5,15,negative

Now start typing ""long"" which is the parameter/return type of different methods and you still get proposals.- Please comment the non-subsequent substring match code in JDT/Core patch for now. - The camel case matching in Eclipse is broken now. In the above example, press ctrl+space after ""b.aSL"" and it doesn't complete to ""addSelectionListener(..)"". - Please include line comments and Javadocs with all the code changes in JDT/Core and JDT/UI patches to make the review simpler.- You should test the existing and new features properly before uploading new patch sets.Pending:- Substring completion for types (to be handled after substring completion works properly for methods).- Test cases.",8,4800,2015-07-14 13:11:53,2015-08-03 21:14:59,488,MERGED,1.0,10.0,3,5,15,positive

I suppose, the names were chosen before support for camel case matching was added. For now, I have updated Javadoc to reflect how validation is done but have not touched the method names since that change would affect subclasses as well.

It's the branch that always points to the latest release. The Git master branch does not have this semantic.Also my guess is that in most cases, when users want to convert their repository to Gitflow, it would make more sense to turn the existing master into develop (e.g. the EGit repository).",4,5398,2015-08-28 21:44:57,2015-09-09 22:53:08,289,MERGED,10.0,386.0,3,6,6,negative

There are quite a few places where SnapshotException is caught, and it is either wrapped in a RuntimeException or reported as an error.In some cases we have to do one of those since the catching method cannot throw a checked exception, but we should make sure that the choice of throwing SnapshotException, wrapping in RuntimeException, or reporting the error is correct.In general, is the approach that ""user facing"" things like queries should report errors, but that ""code facing"" things like the collection extraction API should throw exceptions?There are some places where the existing query code catches SnapshotException and reports an error, but since the logic is now pushed inside the collection extraction API it throws a runtime exception and the query no longer catches it (e.g. CollectionFillRatioQuery). This means that previously there would be an error reported to the user but it would now lead to an uncaught RuntimeException.If we wanted to not wrap in RuntimeException, basically every method that does not implement an existing API would need to throw SnapshotException since implementing code may want to call another method that does.

It was a lousy copy-paste from my side.As for the approach to this I don't think I clearly understand what you mean. We need this to run also on startup and on theme change and this is OS-specific. Do you have some pointer in the code where we are doing something similar with CSS handlers?

Basically when you go through IEB (not EventAdmin) the data object is put in the dictionary with the key IEventBroker.DATA.

1666,"Patch Set 3:Let me explain the reset functionality. Before 4.4. if you applied a theme and afterwards another theme all stuff that was not overriden in the new theme remained styled as in the first theme. That was annoying and therefore we had this ""Restart"" warning in the Preference dialog (which you implemented).In 4.4. we introduced the ""reset to default"" functionality. If you switch from theme A to B, everything would be set to ""default"" and afterwards everything would be styled accordingly to B. This allows new themes to control everything without side effects from older themes. Please note that we still have a few bugs in the reset stuff, e.g., Form controls do not all support the reset functionality.So in your case, if I switch from one theme to ""Something else"" all styling must be resetted to the default, e.g., preferences, colors, etc. As you are now argue this reset requirement away for the OS settings in this review, we also tried to argue that away for the preferences but this was strongly requested by the JDT team.",3,6922,2015-04-17 10:16:07,2015-04-17 10:16:07,0,MERGED,14.0,218.0,3,13,10,negative

1720,"Patch Set 1:Sorry, I was on easter vacation and couldn't respond early enough.Could we please revert this change?  It dramatically reduces theperformance in case of non-bare repositories. Hey Shawn, what'sup? I have not seen such a small change with such a bad performanceimpact passing your review eyes :-)Semantically I think this change is correct. We want to avoiddealing with pathes where there are no diffs. How to achieve that?You could either apply a ANY_DIFF filter to the treewalk or comparethe tree entries manually when walking over the unfiltered trees.Previously ResolveMerger was manually comparing TreeEntriesand skipped over those where there are no diffs. Now you added the ANY_DIFF filter.ANY_DIFF sounds logical but performance wise it's not soo good.Its a very generic filter which compares content-IDs of all participatingTreeIterators. It doesn't differentiate between the differentiterators and blindly computes id's for the content unless it findsdifferent ids. If the treewalk happens to have a FileSystem basedWorkingTreeIterator included this means that you will have to readnearly every single File in the working tree and compute it's content SHA1to do the merge. ANY_DIFF has no idea that there may be a DirCacheIteratoralso in the TreeWalk which already contains the SHA1 of the non-dirtyworkingtree files. ANY_DIFF will always compute the SHA1 again. Onlyexception: if ANY_DIFF detects already a difference between e.g.OURS and THEIRS then it knows early that there is a diff and canskip calculating SHA1's for filesystem content.If we manually do the detection of diffs in an unfiltered treewalkwe can be much faster. Look at ResolveMerger.processEntry() to lookat all the cheap shortcuts we can use. E.g. if the index is dirty(somebody added something for that path) we can let the merge fail becauseof that.If OURS, THEIRS, BASE don't contain anything for that path we knowit's only index and working tree which may contain something for thefile - no need to process this path during the merge. If OURSis equal to BASE then the merge result is clear: It must be in THEIRS.All these are decisions we can take and completely ignoring whatsin the expensive working tree.Long talk - but here comes real world performance measurements showinghow this change compares performance wise to it's predecessor commit.

Then assign p1 and p2 to w1; p2 and p3 to w2.Next, try to DnD p1 and p2 (together) from w1 to w2. The result is that p1 is moved to w2, but p2 is not removed from w1.In Package Explorer this operation is not allowed (i.e. moving a group of projects which contain some projects that are already in the target working set).I think that for now we should keep the same behavior in both explorers.I also took a quick look at the code.

1877,"Patch Set 1:None as far as I can see. The class (PathEnvironmentVariable) is private and only used to contribute to the PATH environment variable when cross-compiling. The contribution is the path to the cross compiler you specify in your project settings. Normally that path is prepended. It normally works fine, unless you use say ${ARM_TOOL_PATH} which java.io.File does not understand.

This is bad UI behavior and switching Top Level elements also preserves the selection.- The menu items swap:	- first time the new menu item is second	- exit and restart: the new menu item is at the top	You need to specify the order/position relative to the existing item (Top Level Elements) - afaik this is possible- Empty folders get the + (or >) sign, but clicking does nothing.

It doesn't matter what the defaults were when the perspective was created, only that the perspective remember what actionSets are active at the moment.This is still true, but ActionSetManager (and also no one else) never persisted the ""disabled"" action sets as user choice. So you could request to show/hide them (depending on the application needs), but once user decides to get rid of some action set, this decision must ""override"" application choice. The best example is the debug action sett with the global debug buttons. In the old implementation you could try to ""hide"" them - but on next restart they will come back again, or, even worse, as soon as you hit a breakpoint - and this mean they will be back in a minute. See the nice comment about it in the LaunchView (written *before* the big e4 changes), line 1442:			// When the launch view becomes visible, turn on the			// debug action set. Note that the workbench will handle the			// case where the user really doesn't want the action set			// enabled - showActionSet(String) will do nothing for an			// action set that's been manually disabled.",8,7937,2014-12-21 15:32:17,2015-01-07 12:52:48,405,MERGED,3.0,66.0,4,7,14,negative

2343,"Patch Set 5:(2 comments)Hi,I've been working on this change-set, but unfortunately I get an error when trying to push the changes to gerrit[2].Until I manage to solve it and push the code, I thought it's best to write some comments about the changes I made.I found this forum post [1] that describes a way to solve the dirty editor problems. Basically, we'll need to call the doSave() method for all the editor pages to remove their dirty status. After this, calling the editorDirtyStateChanged(); method will remove the * mark from the editor.There are more comments in-line.[1]: http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/96716/[2]: Resolving deltas: 100% (16/16)Processing changes: refs: 1, done----------Reviewing commit: a88dc2a0Authored by: Andreas Sewe <andreas.sewe@codetrails.com>The author is a committer on the project.error: You are not a project committer.error: Only project committers can push on behalf of others.Please see http://wiki.eclipse.org/CLA",5,8960,2014-06-12 19:10:02,2014-07-10 07:24:01,660,MERGED,19.0,705.0,2,4,18,negative

2346,"Patch Set 8:(3 comments)> If I create a new snippet (Either through the ""Create Snippet"" context menu or through ""Add"" in the Snippets view) the snippet doesn't start out as needing to be saved (the little * symbol).Hi Andreas,I am not sure if this is a bug. I think this is the normal behavior of an editor. For example, if you create a new Java class in your IDE, the java editor won't pop-up and expect you to save the class before making any modifications to it.I think the snippet editor should not do this either.And you are right, the data-binding framework and the form editor framework are both tracking changes in the view/model. If we use only the form editor framework, we'll have to update the model by hand. (See the in-line comments)Also, I just realized that I might have made a mistake when using the data binding framework. This will update the model whenever changes occur in the editor, but we need to update it only when the save action takes place (i.e. in the commit method of the form parts). Although this is not visible as it only updates the in-memory model, not the actual json file, I think we still should avoid it. So this would be another +1 for not using the data binding framework.",8,8960,2014-06-12 19:10:02,2014-08-13 08:54:17,1477,MERGED,20.0,743.0,3,14,18,negative

See my latest patch for the workaround. > When pressing ""Clear model cache"" i get an unrelated message in the dialog (The search was cancelled.  Not all results may have been displayed.)The filter can still search while the index job is running.  It starts a search job.  Clearing the cache cancels that job.  The search finds all items by default without typing, so it was most likely running when you cleared the cache.  See the progress view to verify there are 2 jobs running.I like having results in the table immediately, and that is why the search starts before typing anything.  Especially when the default 'Project Only' is selected. > When pressing ""run in background"", the list is not updated upon completion.The results will only update when the filter is changed due to lack of provider feedback.  See final comment on provider status callback. This is a very narrow scoped feature with much overhead.  I can't see initializing on startup, or even when the dialog first opens.  It should only happen on first use.  The provider chooses to to initialize, and the GUI has no idea this is even taking place.  The current filter/provider mechanism has no callbacks regarding initialization (only a clear cache method).   This leaves us with 2 choices:  Go back to the modal dialog with cancel option, or create a provider status callback mechanism.  I am leaning towards the thought that if you can't use the filter while the provider is initializing, there is no harm in the modal dialog.

Clicking on a column gives multiple of the following NPEs:java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Index: 8, Size: 8    at java.util.ArrayList.RangeCheck(ArrayList.java:547)    at java.util.ArrayList.get(ArrayList.java:322)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.osview.OSData.getColumnText(OSData.java:123)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.osview.ContentLabelProviderWrapper.getColumnText(ContentLabelProviderWrapper.java:67)    at org.eclipse.jface.viewers.TableColumnViewerLabelProvider.update(TableColumnViewerLabelProvider.java:70)2- Starting a session and choosing a different resource to display from the drop down gave me this NPE:Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.osview.OSResourcesView.populateViewMenu(OSResourcesView.java:536)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.osview.OSResourcesView.showTable(OSResourcesView.java:400)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.osview.OSResourcesView.update(OSResourcesView.java:365)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.osview.OSResourcesView.access$3(OSResourcesView.java:294)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.osview.OSResourcesView$6.update(OSResourcesView.java:271)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.osview.SessionOSData$3.run(SessionOSData.java:231)3- I also saw another NPE once in a while:java.lang.NullPointerException    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.osview.ResourceClassContributionItem.updateClasses(ResourceClassContributionItem.java:96)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.osview.OSResourcesView.update(OSResourcesView.java:309)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.osview.OSResourcesView.setDebugContext(OSResourcesView.java:282)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.osview.OSResourcesView.setDebugContext(OSResourcesView.java:245)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.osview.OSResourcesView.setupContextListener(OSResourcesView.java:198)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.osview.OSResourcesView.createPartControl(OSResourcesView.java:177)    at org.eclipse.ui.internal.e4.compatibility.CompatibilityPart.createPartControl(CompatibilityPart.java:129)    at org.eclipse.ui.internal.e4.compatibility.CompatibilityView.createPartControl(CompatibilityView.java:155)    at org.eclipse.ui.internal.e4.compatibility.CompatibilityPart.create(CompatibilityPart.java:300)    at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)    at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:39)    at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:25)    at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:597)4- The view menu seems broken.  When I remove a column, the column stays, but when I try to add it, it adds a new duplicate one.5- If I scroll down the view and then change the debug context (but stay in the same launch) the view scrolls back to the top.  I think it would be more user-friendly to not change the view at all.  Maybe it is as simple as noticing that the context change can be ignored since the ICommandControlDMContext is the same.6- I got this NPE when switching from one launch to antoher sometimes.  I might have screwed up my launch, but it shows that it could happen:java.lang.NullPointerException    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.osview.OSResourcesView.setDebugContext(OSResourcesView.java:256)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.osview.OSResourcesView.setDebugContext(OSResourcesView.java:245)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.osview.OSResourcesView.access$4(OSResourcesView.java:214)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.osview.OSResourcesView$4.debugContextChanged(OSResourcesView.java:193)    at org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.contexts.DebugWindowContextService$1.run(DebugWindowContextService.java:212)    at org.eclipse.core.runtime.SafeRunner.run(SafeRunner.java:42)    at org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.contexts.DebugWindowContextService.notify(DebugWindowContextService.java:210)    at org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.contexts.DebugWindowContextService.notify(DebugWindowContextService.java:185)    at org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.contexts.DebugWindowContextService.debugContextChanged(DebugWindowContextService.java:408)    at org.eclipse.debug.ui.contexts.AbstractDebugContextProvider$1.run(AbstractDebugContextProvider.java:79)7- In all-stop mode, I like how the menus become grayed out when the target is not available.  However, the 'fetch' link remains usable, which will trigger a ""Fething data..."" which will only complete once the inferior is interrupted8- If there are multiple debug contexts selected,  the code choosed the first one arbitrarily.  This is not clear to the user. I suggest one of two things:  a) If all selected contexts have the same parent ICommandControlDMContext, then display resources as done now using any one context. If the parents are different, then disable and empty the view or   b) Always disable and empty the view for multi-selection9- The case where -info-os returns an error does not seem to be handled properly.  For example, if I have the OSResources view open when using a post-mortem session (core file), GDB gives:   448,664 [MI]  24-info-os   448,666 [MI]  24^error,msg=""Can not fetch data now.""   or   600,684 [MI]  25-info-os modules   600,686 [MI]  25^error,msg=""Can not fetch data now.""But the view is stuck showing ""Determining available OS resource classes..."" or ""Fetching data..."" depending on the timing.10- One time I got the following reply from GDB (maybe my gdbserver was wrong), but it caused an NPE that I think we should guard against:   915,516 [MI]  42-info-os semaphores   921,522 [MI]  ~""Ignoring packet error, continuing...\n""   921,523 [MI]  42^error,msg=""Can not fetch data now.""Exception in thread ""MI RX Thread"" java.lang.NullPointerException    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.output.MIInfoOsInfo.get(MIInfoOsInfo.java:173)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.output.MIInfoOsInfo.parseResourcesInformation(MIInfoOsInfo.java:128)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.output.MIInfoOsInfo.<init>(MIInfoOsInfo.java:75)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.commands.MIInfoOs.getResult(MIInfoOs.java:47)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.commands.MIInfoOs.getResult(MIInfoOs.java:1)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.AbstractMIControl$RxThread.processMIOutput(AbstractMIControl.java:907)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.AbstractMIControl$RxThread.run(AbstractMIControl.java:754)11- The new osresources.gif icon should go under the view16 folder and should be renamed to osresources_view.gif,    i.e., dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/icons/full/view16/osresources_view.gif    Don't forget to update the plugin.xml file to match12- In MANIFEST.MF, please export the new osview package, as the other packages are exported",7,9709,2012-05-05 08:54:55,2012-09-12 08:43:28,3119,MERGED,17.0,1896.0,2,4,9,negative

The old code was flat out wrong to skip commits already marked SEEN.

If the candidate is still in the queue, merge in the regions from the 2nd (or nth) path for future processing. If it was already popped, put it back in and reprocess that part of the DAG until you find an ancestor candidate that is still sitting in the queue and can have the region(s) merged into it.I mostly had style nits, and some questions about why the time equality topo sort is necessary.",1,9995,2014-04-13 17:21:06,2014-04-13 17:33:29,0,MERGED,4.0,224.0,4,6,6,negative

3001,"Patch Set 2:(16 comments)Thanks for the valuable feedback!Regarding the distinction of C++11 attributes and GCC attributes: I left the GCC attributes as is and added the attribute specifiers for representing C++11 attributes. The distinction can be seen for example in the NodeWriter. If an I(CPP)ASTAttribute is encountered in a IASTAttributeOwner it is expected to be a GCC attribute. If an ICPPASTAttributeSpecifier is encountered there, it is expected to be a C++11 attribute. The previous implementation of attributes is a bit limiting regarding the capabilities required by C++11 attributes (scope and multiple attributes in one specifier).I also thought about a solution which introduces an attribute specifier for GCC attributes, but that would break the current API. It's related to the problem mentioned in my comment (Line 23) in ICPPASTAttributeSpecifier.",2,10251,2014-01-30 08:46:18,2014-02-26 12:06:41,651,MERGED,39.0,1681.0,3,6,10,negative

3048,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1Hi,thanks for contributing via Gerrit. I know about the contribution in the ticket itself, but I didn't had time to dig into this in more detail.Some things about your contribution:1. It seems you have the trailing whitespace issue. Looking at the ScrollBarHandlerTemplate there seem to be more changes marked as there are really. Could you please try to solve that so checking the changes is easier?2. This change may break backwards compatibility in case the ActiveCellEditorRegistry was used outside NatTable to perform modifications inside. Like exchanging the data or deleting a current selected value (e.g. https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=425176)Although the intention about the change is correct, I would like to keep the AbstractCellEditorRegistry for backwards compatibility. But it should be marked as deprecated, pointing to the new instance and telling about the issue when using it further. So users who will update won't get compile errors immediatelly.3. ScrollBarHandlerTemplateAlthough I'm not quite sure how to solve it better, I don't like the solution so far. The first thing is the instanceof check that seems to be not necessary. I thought you wanted to get rid of it?The second thing is that this change might not be compatible with the split viewport feature that was added lately. If you check the _703_HorizontalSplitViewportExample you will see that the sliders will be created by using the parent composite of the NatTable instance and are then added later on. So in case of split viewports, your change will break functionality.",1,10320,2014-01-13 13:15:12,2014-01-20 22:46:04,177,MERGED,11.0,656.0,2,3,8,positive

3572,"Patch Set 2:> This is by design. Merely changing null.unboxInt() to return 0 instead of -1 will break MANY things only in the state system (like stack attributes, off the top of my head). And that's without talking about views.There's a few things broken as it is now:- You can't get a -1 Int value from the factory method but you can get one using incrementAttribute() on a -2 Int value- Calling incrementAttribute() on this -1 Int value skips 0 and goes to 1.- The State System Explorer view cannot display a factory-made -1 Int value (as it is nullValue), it shows a blank value.If there is any code that is using the unboxed value of nullValue to check for null, that is badly designed code because it cannot differentiate with a real Int of that same value, it should use isNull(). I believe it's better to bite the bullet and correct that code now. Hopefully all of it is fixed by the patch now.Mathematically, I think it makes more sense to use zero as the null value's numerical value.> This is also by design. If we start to allow unboxing from one type to another, people might stop caring about what the actual type is, and always unbox their things into longs for example, doing costly casts over and over.It's a point to consider, but I prefer to give the benefit of the doubt and the flexibility to the designers. In the code I'm doing now, I have to do floating point mathematical operations on a list of state values that can be a mix of Int, Long, Double or nullValue. Using unboxDouble() gives much cleaner code than having a if-else or switch statement on the value Type to figure out the correct unboxing method.The unit tests should be correct now. The LTTng kernel state system creates a Threads/-1 attribute because the first events arrive before the Current_thread attribute has any value set. I considered updating the expected test state system with these events using the Threads/0 attribute (due to the current thread nullValue's int value), but decided against it because it would still be incorrect to consider that these events occurred in the swapper (0) thread. So the nullValue current thread continues uses the -1 attribute for the 'unknown' thread.",2,10842,2013-09-12 22:00:50,2013-09-13 19:47:48,21,MERGED,7.0,51.0,3,6,6,positive

Finally I'm having a few observations/questions on the model:    For the Approval and Requirements, I think the model is generic enough, although I never worked with requirements in Gerrit and I'm not sure how they work really.

Am I right in this?    The TaskReference is gone from the Review, but is still in the ReviewGroup.  I am a little confused by this.  I thought that the REview itself was a Mylyn task, so now where is the link?  Also, why do we still have a taskReference at the Review Group level?  I don't think we need it.

What is> the rationale behind this?  Can't all the info be in a single Review EClass?I isolated Change because it supports those changes that don't have an associated review. And it's also a practical thing because we want to be able to create one-off parent and children changes attached to reviews. These aren't actually changes per se, they're (in Gerrit) simply git references. I think this distinction is useful beyond Gerrit as you're likely to want to have change references that allow you to see the dependency tree..?> Also, I noticed that review now> has Change parents and childrens elements.

4993,"Patch Set 8:The code was adapted to work with the new Remotes API that was just merged in.  Basically the functionality is as before and is tested (except for comparing review items which I could not test due to new bug 403389).There is one part missing to resolve the File Revisions when opening a file from the Review Navigator.  Miles I will need your help for this one, see the TODO comments in OpenCompareEditorProvider#init.Right now I use the ReviewBehavior object to pass in the parent repository needed to resolve the file revision from the team repository and the resolution is done when the file is opened in the compare editor.  Ideally, we should add a reference to the repository in the ReviewItemSet model element and a team IFileRevision reference in the Mylyn Review IFileRevision.  This would enable use to decorate the IFileItem icon in the GErrit Task editor and Review Navigator at all times.  However, to make that work, we need a way to detect that the workspace file has changed to redo the resolution when the user changes his workspace (e.g. when checking out another git branch).  This should be investigated and done as part of the effort for bug 371428, which is the evolution of the solution provided here).We should also change the Mylyn Review IFileRevision element name to IFileVersion to avoid confusion with the team API element (see bug 403393)In any case, except for the OpenCompareEditorProvider problem, this is ready for the final review",8,11986,2013-03-14 19:42:26,2013-03-14 19:42:26,0,MERGED,17.0,597.0,4,9,11,negative

6058,"Patch Set 10:Content can't change during reading. Or at least it shouldn't. The correct way to modify the config file is to write a new copy of it to config.lock, then atomically rename config.lock to config. Anyone who edits the file in place is just asking to corrupt the file, and/or confuse a concurrent reader.But since this code is opening the file and then later stats it to find the length to estimate the read, and these are both resolving the path down to the inode separately it is possible for the file to change in length if someone renames an updated version in between the two calls.This is low level enough, and used often enough by JGit, that I want it to robustly handle the file size changing when the lock file rename protocol was followed by a concurrent writer. Otherwise servers will fall over periodically when a concurrent writer races against a reader, and the reader will eventually get caught between the two path->inode translations.Go ask Sun why the felt it wasn't necessary to be able to determine the length of an open file from a FileInputStream using the fstat() system call.

Let me know if you see any problems with it.The generator should now return all commits up to the specified depth, ignoring any that were part of commonBase.  But it will correctly start returning any commits below the boundary of a previous shallow checkout, and return all commits at the old boundary as UNINTERESTING so that the PackWriter can exclude the right things from the pack.  As far as I can tell, this is correct behavior in all cases.I couldn't do the SEEN thing like I was planning on doing, because uninteresting commits get the flag set on them as well (as part of markStart()), so sometimes it's already present on commits in our queue even though we haven't added all their parents yet.  I reworked the depth stuff a bit and added some comments, hopefully making it clear enough that the depth sorting accomplishes the same thing.I'm cautiously optimistic that this is getting pretty close.

I had to turn off my reorder commits logic when a shallow clone is being used, because the reordering was packing parent commits that should not have been included in the pack. Not your fault, since the code is newer than the last version you touched in the patch. :-)I think I also busted shallow clone over smart HTTP. The server always crashes with an exception during the exchange, but it works correctly. Smart HTTP clients have an extra intermediate request that the UploadPack code isn't expecting.

N=2560000, D=793, time/(N*D):1.49E0, time/(N*D^2):1.88E-3This tells us that Patience diff can be even faster then Myers. But even more interesting to me is the value for D (the size of the found edit-script). PatienceDiff found an 5 times lesser edits than myers. I won't say that smaller edit-scripts (with probably huger regions) are better, but my big hope is that PatienceDiff brings ""better diffs"" regarding readability by humans. We should have tests with real-world content which proof that. Tests which show better quality of the diffs as listed here: http://bramcohen.livejournal.com/73318.html",6,13292,2010-09-02 21:41:15,2010-09-04 06:55:47,33,MERGED,4.0,751.0,2,6,10,positive
6475,"Patch Set 6: (5 inline comments)FWIW, I'm still not done speeding up PatienceDiff.  I think we can do even better than we are doing right now.  Some of the ideas may even be leveraged back into MyersDiff.  I just haven't thought about doing that yet because its still a big ugly black box to me.Coming up with D=793 on PatienceDiff when MyersDiff comes up with D=4210 is because we are only looking at unique common lines.  When PatienceDiff cannot find a unique line in a region, it just bails and does a giant replace, while MyersDiff continues to look for context.If we plugged in MyersDiff at this point as a fallback, we should get D=4210 again.  But I'm not sure that is the best immediate fallback strategy.  We could instead build a histogram of the common lines and pick the least duplicated common lines and try to find the LCS around those.  By using least duplicated we should still avoid nasty cases like ""\t}\n"" as being an anchor point for the matching, but would still be able to break out of the degenerate case.Thus far I have done only very limited testing of PatienceDiff on real-world input.  I did wire it into DiffFormatter and run `jgit log -p` to scan through the diffs.  I didn't see any obvious variations from MyersDiff, but I don't think recent JGit history is a poster child for where patience diff is supposed to produce more readable results.In case you didn't know, my motivation behind PatienceDiff was to find another solution to Gerrit issue 487 [1], infinite loop in MyersDiff.  Unfortunately patience diff really fails on single-character sequences (due to insufficient common unique points), but the algorithm is trivially simple and easy to prove that it will terminate.  I'm probably going to try and do a word-level variant of RawText and see if we can get a word-level thing to work better under PatienceDiff for the intraline difference coloring in Gerrit.Also, MyersDiff is really slow for Gerrit.  For some patches it takes 2.5s to display the page.  Of that 2.5s, 2.450s is spent in MyersDiff doing the intraline work.  Getting a faster algorithm under it would be nice.[1] http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=487",6,13292,2010-09-02 21:41:15,2010-09-04 06:55:47,33,MERGED,4.0,751.0,2,6,10,negative

7165,Patch Set 1:This seem to hurt LT proxy design. I'm not certain how to handle this change too. So lets discuss some ideas.I think it should be designed as:1. Create a new interface org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.IRemoteConnection2. Provides an implementation of IRemoteConnection for local connections (org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.LocalConnection)3. Your RDTConnection goes to package org.eclipse.linuxtools.internal.rdt.proxy. It should implement the IRemoteConnection interface too.4. The method RDTConnection#getConnectionsName goes to org.eclipse.linuxtools.internal.rdt.proxy.RDTProxyManager. Perhaps it should return a list of IRemoteConnection instead of the connections name. Notice that RDTProxyManager has already a getConnection(uri) method5. Finally create a method in org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.RemoteProxyManager to return either LocalConnection or RDTConnection based upon the URI and/or IProject.Notice that org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch has already two classes about remote connection: RemoteConnection and RemoteConnectionException. They doesn't fit in current LT proxy design but I am not sure how to deal with it... :(,1,14238,2015-10-20 18:20:45,2015-10-20 18:20:45,0,ABANDONED,12.0,292.0,3,4,3,negative

If this was done to give dirty editors chance to save their content - this doesn't work either, because first of all user denied once that he won't save it and second because the editor immediately recognize that resource is gone and simply stops to render the content and shows ""file does not exist"" error.The good news: with https://git.eclipse.org/r/41675 patch dirty editors of closed project will be closed too.Not so good news: this works only for projects closed with the ""standard"" CloseResourceAction - all other ""closing"" possibilities (custom actions or direct API use) will still not close the editor.So I think this change still makes sense.",3,14765,2015-02-10 21:46:15,2015-02-11 05:54:05,8,ABANDONED,1.0,7.0,4,8,3,negative

Someone who wishes to use the ObjectInserter directly probably doesn't want external processes to kick-in... not to mention the hooks themselves expect to be run in a particular environment; most notably, in an environment where the repository isn't locked (.git/index.lock doesn't exist). A hook (for example, post-commit) could very well checkout another branch, copy create a copy of the commit there, then re-checkout the original branch. On the other hand, CommitBuilder shouldn't be used without having locked the repo beforehand IIUC.Likewise, the pre-commit hook can ""block"" a commit entirely, which wouldn't be possible without some hickups if done too low-level : the CommitCommand, RebaseCommand, CherrypickCommand... or anything called by EGit might setup some preparation on the repository before calling the lower level ObjectInserter... but if the hook rejects the commit, all of this setup is not only useless but needs to be reverted.I'll try and pull them down a few level if you think that's necessary, but I don't really know how to do it cleanly.",3,14794,2014-10-31 14:20:14,2014-11-03 09:32:07,67,ABANDONED,6.0,78.0,3,5,9,negative

Why not in this case?  Or are we free now to introduce more POM hierarchy for other purposes?  That would be fine with me; I just thought that was not currently policy.  Also, I'm concerned that we're adding POM files that aren't maintained within the Eclipse projects and are therefore not easily managed within the Eclipse environment (they are only accessible in the Git directories).  For example, there isn't a plugins/infra/gmfdiag/css/xtext/.project file to create an Eclipse project that makes the pom.xml accessible within Eclipse.Any comment on the site.xml and xdoc files that look like auto-generated stubs?  AFAIK, we don't use these in Papyrus.  And all of the files that are changed in plug-ins that aren't generated?What I was hoping to see was common infrastructure that I could re-use in my own Xtend projects to simplify their build configuration (which, granted, isn't exactly complex:  the xtend-maven-plugin is quite simple).

And, what about the ModelExplorer, where we don't have any graphical information?The direct editors also require the diagrams to be regenerated to work properly, and I think Sequence Diagram is not up-to-date.A more powerful framework for declaring direct editors may be required (Currently, editors are declared on a metaclass, regardless of the edition context)Let's postpone this task until the requirements are complete & accurate",3,14975,2014-05-26 16:11:05,2014-09-29 11:14:51,3019,ABANDONED,1.0,131.0,3,6,3,negative

7319,"Patch Set 1:Hi J Langley,First, thanks for the contribution!   Your patch looks excellent.  I think we should easily be able to get this incorporated into ECF 3.9.1.A few very minor comments:1) For the ScpBrowseFileTransferFactory class:  Is there any need to have this class be in a new (and exported) package org.eclipse.ecf.provider.filetransfer.scp?  Unless you already know that this class is going to be accessed by some other bundle, I would prefer that it be placed in the existing internal package:  org.eclipse.ecf.internal.provider.scp.  That way, the scp provider code would all be exposed by internal-only packages...and this browse edition would be consistent with the retrieve and send classes (which are in the internal package now).2) If you move the ScpBrowseFileTransferFactory class into the internal package, it would make it unnecessary to export a new package in the manifest.mf.  For maintenance, it would be nice for us to continue to not export any non-internal packages.I can make the following changes if you wish...just wanted to include them in public review:3) The Bundle-Version in the manifest should be updated from 2.0.100.qualifier to 2.1.0.qualifier (minor revision because of new functionality).4) In org.eclipse.ecf.internal.provider.filetransfer.scp.ScpFileSystemBrowser there are a couple of commented lines:		// FIXME - This code is from ScpOutgoingFileTransfer, but it throws		// exceptions		// if (scpUtil != null) {		// scpUtil.sendZeroToStream(outputStream);		// scpUtil.checkAck(inputStream);		// }Probably best just to remove these lines...unless they are needed for the browse.But overall things look great.  I will fix 3 and 4 prior to commit if you prefer.  If you could address 1/2...or just let me know that there is a good reason for creating/exporting a new package for this class...then I will approve, get things published, submitted and built/tested via the ECF builder for deployment.

7526,"Patch Set 1:The pack is normally closed when the last window to it is evicted from the WindowCache.This eviction occurs one of two ways:The first is by the weak LRU popping the least-recently-used window in order to release resources to keep the cache under the byte or open file limits. As these windows are popped the open window count on PackFile gets decreased, and the file is closed when the count drops to 0.The second is when WindowCache spins the ReferenceQueue. If the JVM GC killed some of our SoftReferences in order to free up heap memory WindowCache will (eventually) spin those now dead references out and decrement the open window count on the associated PackFile. When the count drops to 0, the file is closed.I just made a patch to C Git today that doesn't keep the file open if there is exactly 1 window on it. This might be useful in JGit too, but less so because the default window size is so much smaller (8 Kib in JGit).

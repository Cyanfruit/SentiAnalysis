I've tested it with GTK2 and GTK3 and it's the same. I don't see any abnormal indent.Concerning ""Remember selected filters"" in filters preference page it does not seems to be the same for the two tabs. Is it normal or these two tabs should have this option?

351,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1 Verified+1(1 comment)Hi Simon,thanks for the work! Looks good already! Just a few more thoughts on the pages below. Thanks a lot!Page Engines  * In the Configuration group for tab Match is some padding to the right and hence makes the min width larger then needed.  * The description area has a slightly different background than the rest (on my Linux box using GTK2). It has the right background in the post processor page and the item providers page.Page Filters  * I'd decrease min width a bit  * The description area has a slightly different background than the rest (on my Linux box using GTK2). It has the right background in the post processor page and the item providers page.  * The label ""Automatic behavior"" is misleading. Firstly, this label doesn't really mean a lot. Maybe something like ""Remember selected group"" would be better. Secondly, this preference is independent from the selected group/filter, still it is on the same level as the Description group, which is dependent on the selection. Maybe we should put the description and the list of filters into a group?Page Groups  * Label at the top has a larger margin to the list below than on previous pages.  * Same last two as for filtersItem Providers  * To be consistent with other pages in EMF Compare (e.g. post processors), it'd be good to have a brief label at the top.

So far, it tracks the milestones and is equivalent to the milestone TPD.

The difference is what the default is if the string is missing in the configuration. If there is no configuration then the settings.getBoolean() will return false (IIRC) which means that you can't tell the difference between someone who hasn't set this value and someone who has explicitly disabled the setting. In fact I think this will have the opposite behaviour in that skipGeneration will now explicitly be false and thus always generate it in the case of a missing value. At least that is the case if getBoolean returns a boolean (as opposed to a Boolean).

The problem is that tab and org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote.tabs.RemoteCDSFMainTab do the same thing, but the latter for debug and the former for run.

1200,"Patch Set 7:> ""allowNulls"", the design of the state system is that there should be no null values when returning from a query. It's not explicitely enforced in the backends' runtime code, but it could be. Testing this means testing cases that are not supposed to happen.When used along with a StateSystem, the query does not return null because the StateSystem first fills the interval list with a subset of the intervals and the backend fills it with the remaining subset, and both subsets complete each other and are mutually exclusive. So it is perfectly valid and expected in our runtime implementation that a backend does not fill some of the elements in the interval list. I could easily foresee test cases asserting that some elements must be null in the result of a query. These assertions could be checked after executing testDoQuery() which should therefore complete without failing.> The two ""abstract"" methods (getBackendForBuilding/getBackendForQuerying). The concept of ""reopening"" only applies to the HistoryTreeBackend, this notion should remain in that test class, not in the -Base. Parameters and the ""reopen"" constructor parameter is a nice way to offer both alternatives.Any backend could support reopening and then should override getBackendForQuerying(). Those backends that don't support it don't have to do anything. I think this is perfectly fine. My solution has the advantage to reduce code duplication. In the context of unit test code, I believe this is more important than conceptual considerations.> The abstract method I'm suggesting tells the implementation to ""create a backend and insert these intervals"". This is a clear initialization step.This clear initialization method is implemented in a final protected method that performs these steps in the base class in my patch. I think it is much better.> The pattern of an abstract method to set a protected field is used in other tests. It should be kept as consistent as possible.I hope you are not suggesting that forcing all subclasses to implement a method that can more easily be provided by the base class is preferable for reasons of consistency.I therefore respectfully disagree with your remaining objections. I think this patch is now way, way above the review threshold for unit test code. Thank you for your constructive feedback along the way.",7,3467,2016/1/15 22:36,2016/1/6 23:38,2016/1/15 18:57,3,MERGED,4,361,3,5,13,positive
1201,"Patch Set 4:(8 comments)Looking good. Having both the -Base and a HistoryTreeBackendTest separates nicely what is specific to all backends (like the backend fixture), while HistoryTreeBackendTest owns what is specific to that backend, like the temp file.Good idea about splitting testDoQuery too, it will make it easy to re-use for different interval sets.I'd keep InMemoryBackendTest for another patch. We could move the tests in that class into the new base class to have them run on other backends.I'd also prefer to stick it to one abstract class that sets the backend. This pattern is used in other test classes in the tree. Each test would have to run prepareBackend(something), but then they don't have to worry about disposing it.New patchset inc.",4,3467,2016/1/15 6:34,2016/1/6 23:38,2016/1/14 21:54,8,MERGED,4,323,4,8,13,positive

It's the branch that always points to the latest release. The Git master branch does not have this semantic.Also my guess is that in most cases, when users want to convert their repository to Gitflow, it would make more sense to turn the existing master into develop (e.g. the EGit repository).",4,5398,2015/9/9 23:20,2015/8/28 21:44,2015/9/9 22:53,0,MERGED,10,386,3,6,6,positive

But you are right that it could be nice for the single process case.  We could look into an enhancement to show the exited process node even after GDB dies. I suggest we do that separately.  Note that the exit code is still visible in the title of the console in that case (as long as the process exited on its own).  > * I like this additional way to restart the terminated process from > the same session :-)Me too :)  But of course, that can only work if GDB is kept alive. > * Using the setting to ""Automatically debug forked process"" and > getting a small program which sequentially creates child forked > processes, don't preserve the exit code for all children but one. > This may be related to the collision of re-used group ids.Thanks for doing that test.

And how can the user create filters with no trace opened if he has to go look for field names in another view, which will be empty because no trace is opened?Well you could create a filter monitoring for a certain critical alarm detail without any trace where the alarm has ever happened.> In a sense TmfEventFieldAspect is just a shim between the new aspect API and ITmfEventField.I think it's a useful framework support for any aspect that is made of fields and sub-fields.What I find restrictive about it is that it can only be used for fields that are stored in the event content. I'll update it so that it can be extended to use any other member of the event (that is an ITmfEventField).

This is bad UI behavior and switching Top Level elements also preserves the selection.- The menu items swap:	- first time the new menu item is second	- exit and restart: the new menu item is at the top	You need to specify the order/position relative to the existing item (Top Level Elements) - afaik this is possible- Empty folders get the + (or >) sign, but clicking does nothing.

3348,"Patch Set 1:Hi Neal,you messed things up a bit.1. On updating a patch you need to amend you changes so they have the same change id and we can see it in Gerrit in a clean timeline. You have created a new patch, which is not that good.2. You created a new example, which is also good. :) But I asked for tests. We have several JUnit test cases in the org.eclipse.nebula.widgets.nattable.core.test project. Adding the test cases will help us to verify that everything is working as expected and if anybody changes code later, it still works.3. I can see the whitespace issues in the Gerrit web view. Just open your changes there and you will see them marked red.I haven't pushed the modified code as I'm waiting for your modifications. :) And Gerrit will nofify you when I've done it.Greez,DirkP.S.

And the tab remains empty until I switch e.g. from a Class to a Property, probably because they have different contents in their appearance tab)Steps:- Create a Class diagram with classes and properties- Select the diagram and go to the General tab- Select a Class and go to the Appearance tab- Switch back to the diagram: the General tab is empty- Switch back to the class: the Appearance tab is empty- Select a Property: the Appearance tab is now populated- Select the Class: the Appearance tab is now populated- Select the Diagram: the General tab is still empty- Repeat from step 3 :)Performances are otherwise really good, when switching between similar elements. Maybe this could be extended to ""Similar Sections"" (In addition to ""Similar Tabs""): for the Appearance tab, almost all sections are the same, and this is the most heavy properties tab.

4081,Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1(1 comment)nice improvement :)I propose to- show relative dates (easier to read and needs less space) or add an option to switch the format like done in the history view- either show both author and committer information or show commit date instead of author date since that gives the time when this commit was last updated which IMO is more interesting than the authoring date,1,10433,2014/2/6 0:59,2014/1/29 8:03,2014/1/29 8:03,184,MERGED,4,178,2,3,3,positive
4082,Patch Set 15: Code-Review+1A good starting point for symlink tests regarding checkout. +1 from me.An idea for more tests: All the tests here work mainly with two different states.

So we need (maybe in subsequent changes) tests where the working tree is dirty (differs from index) and where we have staged but uncommitted changes.,15,10435,2014/2/10 23:36,2013/12/3 9:25,2014/2/10 22:29,1,MERGED,2,264,4,5,20,positive

4346,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1(15 comments)Hi XavierVery nice addition! Our user will want that.Beside the inline commends I have two requests below. Please let me know what you think about it.Currently, there is no means to trigger the export command handler. I would suggest to add this to the TmfEventsTable Pop-up menu.Here how you could call the command handler in the method createPopupMenu() of the TmfEventsTable programmatically:final IAction exportToTextAction = new Action(""ExportToText"") {            @Override            public void run() {                IWorkbenchPage activePage = PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getActiveWorkbenchWindow().getActivePage();                IHandlerService handlerService = (IHandlerService) activePage.getActiveEditor().getSite().getService(IHandlerService.class);handlerService.executeCommand(""org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.exportToText"", null);            }        };tablePopupMenu.add(exportToTextAction);-------I also would like to ask you to change the format of the text file to match the columns in the table and instead of a hard-coded order of columns (which are actually the default TMF table columns). This you can achieve using methods extractFieldItems() of TmfEventsTable and getColumns() of the TmfVirtualTable instance which is a member of TmfEventsTable. You will need some public methods to access these information and pass a reference to the TmfEventsTable instance as command parameter.",1,10972,2013/11/11 14:27,2013/10/28 9:09,2013/10/28 9:09,341,MERGED,7,322,2,3,5,positive

It tried both. Your observation might be true for distribution-installed plug-ins. Nevertheless, I'm OK with the change.

6506,"Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisI like the idea to cleanup certain timestamps during checkout, but we can't do this so blindly. It's wrong to always update the index entry with the timestamp of the associated work-tree file. Sometimes we keep index entries although we know that the filesystem has already been modified. Simply copying the filesystem timestamp would be wrong. Think about this: git init touch f.txt        // lastmodified(f.txt) = m git add f.txt      // timestamp(indexEntry(f.txt)) = m git commit -m initial git checkout -b side touch g.txt git add g.txt git commit -m modified1 sleep 2            // to avoid smudged entries echo x > f.txt     // lastmodified(f.txt) = m + 1 git checkout masterIn the last checkout we want to keep the index entry for f.txt with the timestamp of 'm' although we know that thefilesystem has already 'm + 1'Another issue is that this may be quite expensive (not sure about it). Imagine you have the linux kernel repo with 38000 files. You switch from branch master to develop. Since you have not touched the files we want to keep all 38000 files. And youre change forces us to ask the filesystem 38000 times for a timestamp. Without your change we can completely ignore the filesystem and the index for all those files where the HEAD version and the BRANCH version are equal (BRANCH version is the active version on the branch you want to checkout). I love this feature of git to be able to switch branches without having to check the dirtyness of the index and the working tree for 99% of the files.But: maybe you could check for smudged entries and update only them. If for smudged entries (timestamp=0) the filesystem content is the same as the index content then we could use copy over the filesystem lastmodified date and unsmudge the entry.",3,12614,2012/6/5 14:38,2012/6/4 11:18,2012/6/4 11:18,27,MERGED,1,18,3,8,6,positive
6507,"Patch Set 3:thanks for the review. i'm clearly no expert in this area (not yet ;)), and i knew this approach is (probably) not perfect. if you have ideas on how to do better, please feel free to instruct me (instruct me like a 4 year old, pls ;)) or even take over the change.i can only say about the performance: we have a repo with ~33000 files, and this was the reason i tried to improve the situation: re-indexing took ~5-10 minutes (!), and with this change is down to a few seconds, which is way better. AFAICT, the reading of the filestamp is rather unexpensive (at least compared to not reading it, and re-hashing file contents all the time ;)).if the keep() method is the wrong place, or if more care needs to be taken when to call it with zero (old behaviour) or the current file's timestamp (new behaviour) - i can't tell, but you may tell me, and i'll do my best :)currently i just can say that all unit tests go ok, and that i'm quite satisfied with how /fast/ this makes working with JGit/EGit; it really is approximately 50 times faster in most situations, and i had to wait _a lot_ before.",3,12614,2012/6/5 15:12,2012/6/4 11:18,2012/6/4 11:18,27,MERGED,1,18,3,8,6,positive

In fact because gzip and deflate are only different in the compressor and content type that are passed in, I probably would have gone with just a compressable stream class and passed those things into the constructor.    I would also drop the enum for compression type, as that is not compatible with polymorphism anyway. Just use the string mime type instead.I'll review again later this weekend and verify operation.",1,12723,2012/3/30 22:59,2012/3/30 9:02,2012/3/30 9:02,13,MERGED,21,2013,1,4,1,positive

6927,"Patch Set 3:Ok, here's Round 2.  I think I hit all of the style issues from before, and addressed the commonBase problem we discussed.  I did it in a slightly different way than your suggestion, but I think it makes a little bit more sense given how the data comes into the generator.  Let me know if you see any problems with it.The generator should now return all commits up to the specified depth, ignoring any that were part of commonBase.  But it will correctly start returning any commits below the boundary of a previous shallow checkout, and return all commits at the old boundary as UNINTERESTING so that the PackWriter can exclude the right things from the pack.  As far as I can tell, this is correct behavior in all cases.I couldn't do the SEEN thing like I was planning on doing, because uninteresting commits get the flag set on them as well (as part of markStart()), so sometimes it's already present on commits in our queue even though we haven't added all their parents yet.  I reworked the depth stuff a bit and added some comments, hopefully making it clear enough that the depth sorting accomplishes the same thing.I'm cautiously optimistic that this is getting pretty close.

Not your fault, since the code is newer than the last version you touched in the patch. :-)I think I also busted shallow clone over smart HTTP.

Although the branch would be different in each case they have the same name. The entry set could give branches in arbitrary order if I read this correctly.

7261,"Patch Set 6: (5 inline comments)Regarding the latest performance improvements: that's really great and also votes for Patience diff as default diff.But one more general view on it here: Shawn last comment contained lines like:     testMyers 1280000 bytes took  21600751000 ns. N=2560000, D=4210, time/(N*D):2E0, time/(N*D^2):4.76E-4   testPatience 1280000 bytes took   3022629000 ns. N=2560000, D=793, time/(N*D):1.49E0, time/(N*D^2):1.88E-3This tells us that Patience diff can be even faster then Myers. But even more interesting to me is the value for D (the size of the found edit-script). PatienceDiff found an 5 times lesser edits than myers. I won't say that smaller edit-scripts (with probably huger regions) are better, but my big hope is that PatienceDiff brings ""better diffs"" regarding readability by humans. We should have tests with real-world content which proof that.

8321,"Patch Set 1:Hi J Langley,First, thanks for the contribution!   Your patch looks excellent.  I think we should easily be able to get this incorporated into ECF 3.9.1.A few very minor comments:1) For the ScpBrowseFileTransferFactory class:  Is there any need to have this class be in a new (and exported) package org.eclipse.ecf.provider.filetransfer.scp?  Unless you already know that this class is going to be accessed by some other bundle, I would prefer that it be placed in the existing internal package:  org.eclipse.ecf.internal.provider.scp.  That way, the scp provider code would all be exposed by internal-only packages...and this browse edition would be consistent with the retrieve and send classes (which are in the internal package now).2) If you move the ScpBrowseFileTransferFactory class into the internal package, it would make it unnecessary to export a new package in the manifest.mf.  For maintenance, it would be nice for us to continue to not export any non-internal packages.I can make the following changes if you wish...just wanted to include them in public review:3) The Bundle-Version in the manifest should be updated from 2.0.100.qualifier to 2.1.0.qualifier (minor revision because of new functionality).4) In org.eclipse.ecf.internal.provider.filetransfer.scp.ScpFileSystemBrowser there are a couple of commented lines:		// FIXME - This code is from ScpOutgoingFileTransfer, but it throws		// exceptions		// if (scpUtil != null) {		// scpUtil.sendZeroToStream(outputStream);		// scpUtil.checkAck(inputStream);		// }Probably best just to remove these lines...unless they are needed for the browse.But overall things look great.  I will fix 3 and 4 prior to commit if you prefer.  If you could address 1/2...or just let me know that there is a good reason for creating/exporting a new package for this class...then I will approve, get things published, submitted and built/tested via the ECF builder for deployment.

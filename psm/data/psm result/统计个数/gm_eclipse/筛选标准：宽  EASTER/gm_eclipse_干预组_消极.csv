206,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2 Verified+1Thanks for the contribution, Fred!  Even paying attention to copyright statements.This change certainly cuts neatly through a bunch of unnecessary and wonky code.  I was going to complain that changing the APIs in the UI classes from working with URIs to working with IResources results in a loss of generality, so that it would be more difficult to support exporting diagrams to the host filesystem (which is desperately needed, IMO) or other destinations, and that IResource is not even as appropriate a type as IContainer, but then I observed that the entire export infrastructure beneath the UI is all pinned to the IResource contract, anyways.  That, combined with the fact that any clients trying to use these UI bits would have had to construct nonsense URIs, means that I don't mind that this technically is an API-breaking change because that API was already non-functional and it will have to break again some time anyways to support exporting to non-workspace destinations.  Besides that none of these UI classes should ever have been exposed as API to begin with.All of which is to say thanks for working through the contribution process and do come back for more.",1,970,2016/10/14 0:26,2016/10/13 21:08,2016/10/13 21:08,3,MERGED,5,118,4,5,1,negative

But it's worth soliciting feedback from the users who strongly wanted this feature back.I think we should *always* show other projects in the Other category.  The menu item to enable this (""ÔÇªand show remaining projects in "") looks rather bizarre.

1039,Patch Set 1:> What's up now? findbugs crashed...While struggling with https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/69099/ to finally switch the build to compile against neon I switched the build to java 8 and the findbugs version we currently use doesn't support Java 8. There are some bundles in neon which can't be unpacked by Java 7's unpack200 since they have been packed using Java 8 and Java 7 is unable to unpack them and p2 is too dumb to use the corresponding jar as a fallback :-(I switched back the egit.gerrit job to use Java 7 and retriggered the buildI am now first trying to find the cause for the problems I currently face with running egit core tests from maven (also using mars target platform). So I am now first bisecting these problems before tackling the additional problems caused by the switch to neon,1,3107,2016/4/6 21:36,2016/4/5 22:13,2016/4/5 22:13,23,MERGED,2,42,4,9,1,negative

1653,"Patch Set 3:This change is functional, but not entirely ""clean"" yet, for the following reasons:- The modification of the MANIFEST.MF and plugin.xml happens after the original EMF code generation. It would be cleaner to incorporate the necessary changes directly into the EMF code generation step somehow, instead of generating code and immediately patching it.- The XML modification completely changes the format of the XML file regarding white spaces, since it re-exports the entire DOM.- The detection of the correct files happens by checking whether the URI fits the format <something>/plugion.xml and <something>/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF. This happens by String equals() methods, I have not found a nicer solution for this, but it still seems awkward.- The icon for the editor entry is still hardcoded (I have not found a way to extract the icon from the data available at runtime).",3,4916,2015/10/22 9:04,2015/10/21 14:10,2015/10/22 8:17,0,MERGED,4,347,4,8,3,negative

It was a lousy copy-paste from my side.As for the approach to this I don't think I clearly understand what you mean. We need this to run also on startup and on theme change and this is OS-specific.

If you switch from theme A to B, everything would be set to ""default"" and afterwards everything would be styled accordingly to B. This allows new themes to control everything without side effects from older themes. Please note that we still have a few bugs in the reset stuff, e.g., Form controls do not all support the reset functionality.So in your case, if I switch from one theme to ""Something else"" all styling must be resetted to the default, e.g., preferences, colors, etc. As you are now argue this reset requirement away for the OS settings in this review, we also tried to argue that away for the preferences but this was strongly requested by the JDT team.",3,6922,2015/4/17 13:56,2015/4/17 10:16,2015/4/17 10:16,3,MERGED,14,218,3,13,10,negative

2433,"Patch Set 1:(5 comments)Looks great.  A couple of minor improvements suggested in-line.For caching, we have a couple of options.1- we use the generic IGDBHardwareAndOS2.getResourcesInformation() so we could add caching to that call, but just for ""cpus"".  I don't like that because it makes the code less generic, and it may happen that the output of ""-info-os cpus"" does change2- we put a cache in GDBHardwareAndOS_7_10.  This makes sense because it is that service that knows if the data it uses can change.  Personally, I'd use a global array of ICoreInfo[] that gets filled once and then re-used. Don't forget to override flushCache() to also clear that cache (this is for a user operation where we just want to clear everything)",1,7025,2015/4/10 15:20,2015/4/8 16:42,2015/4/9 10:49,28,MERGED,3,236,3,8,3,negative

Problem is with filtering by mylyn workingset (see also bug 460592).IType.getChildren() isn't important, because namespace and type declarations should be reported on same level (IType.getNamespace() and you can forget about namespace declaration, also see what happens in IType.getParent()). Like in JDT for one type per file pattern. Import declarations use only package names (bug 455754). In general, IPackageDeclaration is lighter than IType.

2591,"Patch Set 1:Sorry for the delay. I uploaded a small example at http://www.mathematik.uni-marburg.de/~strueber/henshin_container_example.pngIn the meta-model underlying this example, ""club"" and ""player"" are EOpposite containment/container references. Consequently, both rules in this example have the same effect, which includes the removing and adding of the Player at a different place in the containment hierarchy (potentially a different model instance). However, B does not indicate this effect in the graphical syntax, which makes it difficult for the developer to understand the meaning of this rule.In a small example, the maintainability drawback might not be too drastic. But imagine that the meta-model might be complex and, worse, evolving over time. In an earlier version of the meta-model, Players might have been contained somewhere else, so that Version B actually meant something different at that time. In this case, the warning should definitively make sense.",1,7378,2015/3/2 14:55,2015/2/23 13:10,2015/2/23 13:10,169,MERGED,3,25,4,16,2,negative

2976,"Patch Set 8:> I'm not sure why you're moving the information about disabled actionSets from the actionSets into the page hidden.  It is not moving but adding the persistence layer.> Is it just the regular mechanism is disconnected? I didn't get it, sorry.> For any given window, the perspective worked with the ActionSetManager to turn on or off actionSets (it seems to do it via the IContextService). It doesn't matter what the defaults were when the perspective was created, only that the perspective remember what actionSets are active at the moment.This is still true, but ActionSetManager (and also no one else) never persisted the ""disabled"" action sets as user choice. So you could request to show/hide them (depending on the application needs), but once user decides to get rid of some action set, this decision must ""override"" application choice. The best example is the debug action sett with the global debug buttons. In the old implementation you could try to ""hide"" them - but on next restart they will come back again, or, even worse, as soon as you hit a breakpoint - and this mean they will be back in a minute. See the nice comment about it in the LaunchView (written *before* the big e4 changes), line 1442:			// When the launch view becomes visible, turn on the			// debug action set. Note that the workbench will handle the			// case where the user really doesn't want the action set			// enabled - showActionSet(String) will do nothing for an			// action set that's been manually disabled.",8,7937,2015/1/8 19:12,2014/12/21 15:32,2015/1/7 12:52,30,MERGED,3,66,4,7,14,negative

For public methods in specific objects, you could have getPacketSize(), getResponseSize() etc. IFixedSize is unnecessary.- Having some private methods where size() actually means something different (only first packet) is crazy design. You know today, but 2 months from now nobody will remember, and we'll have lots of fun debugging size problems. Specific methods names, like sizeOfFirstPacket() etc. would be safer.- If there is no interface, then the methods can be static (if the size is constant, of course). If it's static, it should be a public static final int, not a method.

4189,Patch Set 1:Are you talking about changeContextLocale()? I don't have strong feelings about this. I just followed the discussion on the mailing list. But IMHO it is a goof idea for a framework to grant the most possible flexibility. In about 99% nobody will ever use it. But there will be the one percent that will need it. So should we remove it because we don't see the use case for it? Or should we keep it because there might be a use case and it doesn't hurt to be there?,1,10679,2013/12/16 20:42,2013/12/5 14:30,2013/12/13 8:38,84,MERGED,1,77,5,10,3,negative

Pain and tears ensue. Moving to the in-band approach would undoubtedly be the correct way to fix this.(those is-the-statesystem-started-yet? latches make me cringe ;) )However, this is a very big undertaking.

5236,"Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; IP review completed(3 inline comments)See inlined comments.  Also, the editor icons are the ones generated by EMF.  Nothing wrong with that, but we will have to update them when we do the EMF edit part.  Finally I'm having a few observations/questions on the model:    For the Approval and Requirements, I think the model is generic enough, although I never worked with requirements in Gerrit and I'm not sure how they work really.    I think the model is overly complex now with ReviewItemSets, ReviewItems and File items.  Do we really need the ReviewItem element anymore?  To me the information it holds pretty much relates to the ReviewItemSet (i.e. Gerrit PatchSet) anyways, so why keep it?    I saw that you introduced a Change element as a Review superclass.  What is the rationale behind this?  Can't all the info be in a single Review EClass?  Insn't Change a little bit too Gerrit-specific?  Also, I noticed that review now has Change parents and childrens elements.  I suppose this is to take care of the Depends and Needs Changes in Gerrit to see dependencies accross reviews.  Am I right in this?    The TaskReference is gone from the Review, but is still in the ReviewGroup.  I am a little confused by this.  I thought that the REview itself was a Mylyn task, so now where is the link?  Also, why do we still have a taskReference at the Review Group level?  I don't think we need it.    The location right now is restricted to line ranges i.e. textual input.  This will eventually have to change if we want to support Model Reviews, where the ""location"" is not a line range.  This is okay for now but to keep in mind longer term.    ",3,11869,2013/4/17 19:37,2013/4/10 23:53,2013/4/11 0:26,163,MERGED,88,10187,3,11,4,negative

However, this whole thing started out by some colleague (and me) being irritated by exactly such References. You do a Rebase, it finishes, and suddenly you have that ORIG_HEAD thing popping into your face from the HistoryView. Instead of the nice linear history you wanted to achieve by the Rebase, you suddenly have something looking very much like two branches....I think that turning the toggle into some Always/Unreferenced/Never switch would confuse the poor user too much. They would have some branch on a commit and no white label, but once the branch moves to the next commit, the white label would magically appear?So perhaps the solution to this could be to make the Additional Refs visible by default and put a button close to the ""Show All Branches"" button so that users can more easily suppress the Refs?

Equinox DS provides the osgi.extender capability since Neon M4. Now the e4 bundles can specify Require-Capability to that osgi.extender.

8040,Patch Set 1:This seem to hurt LT proxy design. I'm not certain how to handle this change too. So lets discuss some ideas.I think it should be designed as:1. Create a new interface org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.IRemoteConnection2. Provides an implementation of IRemoteConnection for local connections (org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.LocalConnection)3. Your RDTConnection goes to package org.eclipse.linuxtools.internal.rdt.proxy. It should implement the IRemoteConnection interface too.4. The method RDTConnection#getConnectionsName goes to org.eclipse.linuxtools.internal.rdt.proxy.RDTProxyManager. Perhaps it should return a list of IRemoteConnection instead of the connections name. Notice that RDTProxyManager has already a getConnection(uri) method5. Finally create a method in org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.RemoteProxyManager to return either LocalConnection or RDTConnection based upon the URI and/or IProject.Notice that org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch has already two classes about remote connection: RemoteConnection and RemoteConnectionException. They doesn't fit in current LT proxy design but I am not sure how to deal with it... :(,1,14238,2015/10/21 13:34,2015/10/20 18:20,2015/10/20 18:20,19,ABANDONED,12,292,3,4,3,negative

They are thrown away by the ViewRegistry, but shouldn't be.  This is a blocker, IMHO.  * I don't much like the category story, especially with how the ""general"" category is pulled out. But this is forced due to how our current model is built, where an MPartDescriptor's category is not the actual category id and the category is actually encoded as a tag (and hence not localizable?).  ViewRegistry should be fixed, but that doesn't have to be done as part of this work.  I'd at least like this category-finding code pulled out with a comment.  I wonder if we could use the MCategory for this purpose too.  * Change CapabilityFilter to know how to build an activity-style IIdentifier for model elements.

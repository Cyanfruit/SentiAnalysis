951,"Patch Set 14:I still have some unanswered comments from AQRC:> Finally, I still think this would be a good idea:> > we can have both methods here in the abstract class, and then imlpementors would have to override one of them.> In other words we could still have the default implementations of the old ensure/isIndexed(key) methods here, as proposed in Path Set 1. That way, ""legacy"" indexer solutions such as MPS can keep overriding the old methods (and have the new methods implemented here convert the new API calls if a query backend already uses them). At the same time, we can update the EMFQRC to override the new methods to distinguish between indexing services (and have the old methods implemented here convert the old API calls made by ""legacy"" query backends such as Rete).>If we choose this route, there should be some ""implementors notice"" explaining the preceding paragraph - e.g. ""implement exactly one of these two methods"".Maybe this would be too complicated, and not needed here, so I do not really mind if the code is submitted as is, but I would like some response / closure here.",14,1864,2016-07-15 16:20:00,2016-06-16 07:26:24,2016-07-14 11:34:40,28,MERGED,5.0,1747.0,4,12,16,positive

2180,"Patch Set 7:> ""allowNulls"", the design of the state system is that there should be no null values when returning from a query. It's not explicitely enforced in the backends' runtime code, but it could be. Testing this means testing cases that are not supposed to happen.When used along with a StateSystem, the query does not return null because the StateSystem first fills the interval list with a subset of the intervals and the backend fills it with the remaining subset, and both subsets complete each other and are mutually exclusive. So it is perfectly valid and expected in our runtime implementation that a backend does not fill some of the elements in the interval list. I could easily foresee test cases asserting that some elements must be null in the result of a query. These assertions could be checked after executing testDoQuery() which should therefore complete without failing.> The two ""abstract"" methods (getBackendForBuilding/getBackendForQuerying). The concept of ""reopening"" only applies to the HistoryTreeBackend, this notion should remain in that test class, not in the -Base. Parameters and the ""reopen"" constructor parameter is a nice way to offer both alternatives.Any backend could support reopening and then should override getBackendForQuerying(). Those backends that don't support it don't have to do anything. I think this is perfectly fine. My solution has the advantage to reduce code duplication. In the context of unit test code, I believe this is more important than conceptual considerations.> The abstract method I'm suggesting tells the implementation to ""create a backend and insert these intervals"". This is a clear initialization step.This clear initialization method is implemented in a final protected method that performs these steps in the base class in my patch. I think it is much better.> The pattern of an abstract method to set a protected field is used in other tests. It should be kept as consistent as possible.I hope you are not suggesting that forcing all subclasses to implement a method that can more easily be provided by the base class is preferable for reasons of consistency.I therefore respectfully disagree with your remaining objections. I think this patch is now way, way above the review threshold for unit test code. Thank you for your constructive feedback along the way.",7,3467,2016-01-15 22:36:49,2016-01-06 23:38:17,2016-01-15 18:57:36,3,MERGED,4.0,361.0,3,5,13,positive

4444,"Patch Set 1:(5 comments)Looks great.  A couple of minor improvements suggested in-line.For caching, we have a couple of options.1- we use the generic IGDBHardwareAndOS2.getResourcesInformation() so we could add caching to that call, but just for ""cpus"".  I don't like that because it makes the code less generic, and it may happen that the output of ""-info-os cpus"" does change2- we put a cache in GDBHardwareAndOS_7_10.  This makes sense because it is that service that knows if the data it uses can change.  Personally, I'd use a global array of ICoreInfo[] that gets filled once and then re-used. Don't forget to override flushCache() to also clear that cache (this is for a user operation where we just want to clear everything)",1,7025,2015-04-10 15:20:29,2015-04-08 16:42:56,2015-04-09 10:49:57,28,MERGED,3.0,236.0,3,8,3,positive

5741,"Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1I've been playing a little bit with the selection and tab changes, and at some point the Appearance tab became completely empty. (Apparently, this happens when switching from the Diagram's ""General"" tab and a graphical element's ""Appearance"" tab. And the tab remains empty until I switch e.g. from a Class to a Property, probably because they have different contents in their appearance tab)Steps:- Create a Class diagram with classes and properties- Select the diagram and go to the General tab- Select a Class and go to the Appearance tab- Switch back to the diagram: the General tab is empty- Switch back to the class: the Appearance tab is empty- Select a Property: the Appearance tab is now populated- Select the Class: the Appearance tab is now populated- Select the Diagram: the General tab is still empty- Repeat from step 3 :)Performances are otherwise really good, when switching between similar elements. Maybe this could be extended to ""Similar Sections"" (In addition to ""Similar Tabs""): for the Appearance tab, almost all sections are the same, and this is the most heavy properties tab. Currently, if we reuse the same sections between two selections, but add a new one (or remove it), everything is redrawn (Although 80% of the contents is the same)I also have quite a lot of exceptions when switching selection, especially in the dispose() methods, when using multiple selection (I'll attach the log file to the associated bugzilla)",3,9145,2014-07-03 09:35:27,2014-05-23 02:44:04,2014-06-10 17:41:15,543,MERGED,74.0,4208.0,3,6,6,positive

6658,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1Hi,thanks for contributing via Gerrit. I know about the contribution in the ticket itself, but I didn't had time to dig into this in more detail.Some things about your contribution:1. It seems you have the trailing whitespace issue. Looking at the ScrollBarHandlerTemplate there seem to be more changes marked as there are really. Could you please try to solve that so checking the changes is easier?2. This change may break backwards compatibility in case the ActiveCellEditorRegistry was used outside NatTable to perform modifications inside. Like exchanging the data or deleting a current selected value (e.g. https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=425176)Although the intention about the change is correct, I would like to keep the AbstractCellEditorRegistry for backwards compatibility. But it should be marked as deprecated, pointing to the new instance and telling about the issue when using it further. So users who will update won't get compile errors immediatelly.3. ScrollBarHandlerTemplateAlthough I'm not quite sure how to solve it better, I don't like the solution so far. The first thing is the instanceof check that seems to be not necessary. I thought you wanted to get rid of it?The second thing is that this change might not be compatible with the split viewport feature that was added lately. If you check the _703_HorizontalSplitViewportExample you will see that the sliders will be created by using the parent composite of the NatTable instance and are then added later on. So in case of split viewports, your change will break functionality.",1,10320,2014-01-21 09:23:19,2014-01-13 13:15:12,2014-01-20 22:46:04,10,MERGED,11.0,656.0,2,3,8,positive

What I was doing previously was setting the priority of ServiceInfoFactory registration to lowest possible...Integer.MIN_INTEGER or something...so that any other IServiceInfoFactory registration would take priority.3) In the previous code (for accessing the IEndpointDescriptionAdvertiser service) there's doPriveleged block...i.e.	IEndpointDescriptionAdvertiser advertiser = AccessController		             .doPrivileged(new PrivilegedAction<IEndpointDescriptionAdvertiser>() {		This was put in place because of need to run under security manager for CT tests.

In fact because gzip and deflate are only different in the compressor and content type that are passed in, I probably would have gone with just a compressable stream class and passed those things into the constructor.    I would also drop the enum for compression type, as that is not compatible with polymorphism anyway.

10629,"Patch Set 3:Ok, here's Round 2.  I think I hit all of the style issues from before, and addressed the commonBase problem we discussed.  I did it in a slightly different way than your suggestion, but I think it makes a little bit more sense given how the data comes into the generator.  Let me know if you see any problems with it.The generator should now return all commits up to the specified depth, ignoring any that were part of commonBase.  But it will correctly start returning any commits below the boundary of a previous shallow checkout, and return all commits at the old boundary as UNINTERESTING so that the PackWriter can exclude the right things from the pack.  As far as I can tell, this is correct behavior in all cases.I couldn't do the SEEN thing like I was planning on doing, because uninteresting commits get the flag set on them as well (as part of markStart()), so sometimes it's already present on commits in our queue even though we haven't added all their parents yet.  I reworked the depth stuff a bit and added some comments, hopefully making it clear enough that the depth sorting accomplishes the same thing.I'm cautiously optimistic that this is getting pretty close.

Instead this branch has been created to save the work and all future work on automatic generation binded on maven life-cycle.I strongly believe that this kind of work is really important to move Papyrus on the next step of model driven development: - removing generated files from git repository - binding all generations to a the correct life-cycle - avoid any manual generation Regards,Benoit",2,14881,2015-01-08 08:09:10,2014-11-07 12:22:20,2014-11-14 17:14:26,1310,ABANDONED,1049.0,266111.0,4,11,2,positive

11718,"Patch Set 1:Hi J Langley,First, thanks for the contribution!   Your patch looks excellent.  I think we should easily be able to get this incorporated into ECF 3.9.1.A few very minor comments:1) For the ScpBrowseFileTransferFactory class:  Is there any need to have this class be in a new (and exported) package org.eclipse.ecf.provider.filetransfer.scp?  Unless you already know that this class is going to be accessed by some other bundle, I would prefer that it be placed in the existing internal package:  org.eclipse.ecf.internal.provider.scp.  That way, the scp provider code would all be exposed by internal-only packages...and this browse edition would be consistent with the retrieve and send classes (which are in the internal package now).2) If you move the ScpBrowseFileTransferFactory class into the internal package, it would make it unnecessary to export a new package in the manifest.mf.  For maintenance, it would be nice for us to continue to not export any non-internal packages.I can make the following changes if you wish...just wanted to include them in public review:3) The Bundle-Version in the manifest should be updated from 2.0.100.qualifier to 2.1.0.qualifier (minor revision because of new functionality).4) In org.eclipse.ecf.internal.provider.filetransfer.scp.ScpFileSystemBrowser there are a couple of commented lines:		// FIXME - This code is from ScpOutgoingFileTransfer, but it throws		// exceptions		// if (scpUtil != null) {		// scpUtil.sendZeroToStream(outputStream);		// scpUtil.checkAck(inputStream);		// }Probably best just to remove these lines...unless they are needed for the browse.But overall things look great.  I will fix 3 and 4 prior to commit if you prefer.  If you could address 1/2...or just let me know that there is a good reason for creating/exporting a new package for this class...then I will approve, get things published, submitted and built/tested via the ECF builder for deployment.

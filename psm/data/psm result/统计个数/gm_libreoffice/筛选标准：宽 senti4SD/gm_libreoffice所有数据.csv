Ideally eventually it can be fixed...I don't take reverting a unit test lightly, but this one has always been a complete thorn and I'm convinced that keeping in the code that allows it to currently pass is detrimental.  Thus the slightly modified unit test which looks terrible on released versions of 5.x, and mostly correct with all the changes in 5.3.  It certainly is WRONG before this patch hits, so it is a toss-up of one unit test verses another.With the regular page-break, it would be possible to switch to the follow style at that point (which in some cases would be too late, but better than nothing), but doing so has given me round-trip problems that I haven't been able to solve yet.

1830,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2Yes, the code that makes a selection by indices looks unreachable to me. dbaccess seems to assume that ""by bookmark"" and ""by indices"" are two possibilities and to pass a selection along with a boolean flag to document which one it is. I'm not sure of the reasons for that, or if it is just historical cruft that has no reason to be anymore.I thought about just converting this (potentially unreachable) case to bookmarks, but getting the n_th row's bookmark is not immediately obvious... It requires moving the seek cursor (which can muck with expectations of other code about where the cursor is...). The safest would be to make a clone of the resultset and use that to get a bookmark,Anyway, this change is good to go as far as I'm concerned.",1,1706,2016-09-22 10:29:51,2016-09-20 09:25:01,2016-09-20 12:32:49,45,MERGED,1.0,35.0,4,5,1,negative

3002,"Patch Set 5: Code-Review-2(1 comment)I advise against hardcoding specific services.

(either redirect directly to askbot or show a overview page, depending on language. That then can be maintained/updated independently from LO (you cannot change the hardcoded URLs in a released version of LO after all)so again:* make it a generic page instead (not ""Questions and Answers"" but something like ""Get help online"" or something similar)* all URLs in LibreOffice itself should be http://hub.libreoffice.org/something ones.definite -2 because of the special handling of locales, without it it would still be a fat -1 from me",5,2702,2016-07-12 12:47:46,2016-07-07 22:57:48,2016-07-08 23:10:12,85,MERGED,25.0,72.0,3,6,10,positive

It could be an incomplete formula or an invalid value whichwould result in throwing error for all dependent cells. We only want to updatethese dependent cells in some particular condition, say pressing enter, informula bar. Hence the distinction in this UNO command now, so that when theuser is just typing, we don't commit the contents to the cell.I tried looking for other ways to accomplish this, but this approach made mostsense to me.

You can however argue, that since the old tools work, why change it.

I tried that. And can give it another try. But it would require a much bigger change, obviously. The main problem is that wingdi.h is actually included from other windows headers too. So we can't fully control when it's included. But can give it another shot and narrow it down further. In fact, I spent hours trying to find what file includes the conflicting values to create this patch. > The current fix allows workdir/CustomTarget/officecfg/registry/officecfg/Office/Common.hxx > to be included, but if a source file happens to first include that > officecfg/Office/Common.hxx, then include wingdi.h, and later wants > to acutally use the struct RGB from Common.hxx, it still runs into > a problem.Well, that would be be a problem _only_ if wingdi.h was already included _before_ Office/Common.h, and in that case the build would fail because the macro would conflict with the declaration of RGB (my patch avoids this situation).However, if wingdi.h was _not_ included at the point of #undef RGB, then nothing bad would happen if it is included afterwards. Unless I missed something, I don't see how there would still be a problem, as wingdi.h will define RGB without issue.I should add that I hated this particular line of my patch.

But my change will neither help nor harm that case :)(I only fixed the reverse, which is that wingdi.h is included before Common.hxx.)And I believe that case doesn't exist now (if they existed, I fixed them).Containing windows headers in postwin.h will help (which I fully support). But even then, once a header that includes wingdi.h (directly or indirectly) is included in the pch, then we still face the same issue. So it's really tricky.Since I was working on pch files, it was this latter case that really made things complicated. The way to avoid that is to never include an uncontained header that leaks in the pch, which is what we do. So the only case that breaks the build is when RGB is defined before Office/Common.hxx, which I patched.Actually, I think what we should do is add #undef RGB to postwin.h (even when currently it's not needed).

I mentioned this somewhere as a limitation. The reason for this is that the page size is the same, but the margins are removed/reduced. So the text is allowed to fill in more surface area. This could be solved by changing the page dimensions in hide-whitespace mode.

Good to know. The reason I wrote this script is because I have another patch that improves pch generation (a rewrite of update_pch in python that updates every single pch in the codebase in a few seconds). It was obvious to me that to improve the pch generation to make builds faster I had to deal with the problem of conflicting headers (that are excluded from pch) and required headers (that will break the build if left out). This script solves the latter problem, so now what is included in pch headers is purely to accelerate builds, not to prevent the build from breaking.Will submit the update_pch script and updated pch files sometime soon, as time permits.",1,11103,2015-09-03 21:47:25,2015-09-01 00:33:37,2015-09-01 00:33:37,69,MERGED,16.0,378.0,4,6,2,negative

I only submitted when I was confident enough that they won't cause immediate instability (evident from the commit message and the test design/code).

I think all that is required is to adjust http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/basic/source/classes/sbxmod.cxx#1809 (or get rid of that method and adjust the caller (in scriptcont) to pass the current binary format versionplease see https://bz.apache.org/ooo/show_bug.cgi?id=64377needless to say that stuff needs to be retested too (but it would be good to get it in)It is of course possible to juggle the version numbers (and code) in such away to implement just this new update to the binary format (and skip enabling aoo#64377) that's fine too, but...

Any chance you can create one ? > Thanks !Depends what you mean by ""work."" The timers of course _do_ work, but that is not the problem I'm fixing. I'm fixing the issue with high idle CPU utilization. Periodic timers should reset their start time so that they re-fire only after the duration has expired. The issue, I found, is that Timer thinks it's ready to fire again at the next tick. Ticks come in for the _soonest_ next timer delay (this is because we really have only one system timer callback, and we need it to fire for the next timer in the queue). In the worst case they come in immediately (after 1ms) and in those cases Timer thinks it's ready to fire again, which it does. This doesn't cause any obvious problems, other than CPU utilization where there shouldn't be any (because Timer handles background jobs, like spellchecking, which wastes some CPU and returns, but the waste is proportional to the document size and number of documents open).It is clear from the code that nowhere is the start-time reset. Of course I had the luxury of debugging and seeing what was happening, but the code and my comments make it almost trivial to trace the variable in question and see that without changing it, it will trick Timer into firing again. (See Timer::ReadyForSchedule where mnUpdateTime is used.)I can add unittest for this but, from experience, timers are not reliable enough to trap them within a reasonable time frame from make the test meaningful. On a non-realtime OS, they come with no guarantees. And they are less consistent across a number of OSes. We can have a crude ""test fire once"" and ""test don't fire too soon"" but it's harder to have ""fired too late."" Also, it's much harder to simulate the myriads of jobs we have and the arbitrary periods of each (and how they overlap).I'll give it a shot, but applying and running a large document with this 1 liner will show that the idle CPU utilization does go to 0.",5,11525,2015-08-17 14:10:40,2015-07-19 17:33:11,2015-07-20 00:08:15,686,MERGED,1.0,3.0,5,7,5,negative

The configuration's default ""Use formula syntax"" doesn't match the actual default value used in INDIRECT() now. The configuration dialog probably has to check also mbHasStringRefSyntax and if not set present the ""Calc A1 | Excel A1"" setting selected instead.Also, there are a few places left where meStringRefAddressSyntax is set directly, e.g. sc/source/core/tool/formulaopt.cxx in ScFormulaCfg::UpdateFromProperties() that doesn't handle CONV_A1_XL_A1 and doesn't set via SetStringRefSyntax() so mbHasStringRefSyntax remains unset. Also in ScFormulaCfg::ImplCommit() CONV_A1_XL_A1 is not handled.In sc/source/filter/oox/workbookhelper.cxx in WorkbookGlobals::initialize() has aCalcConfig.meStringRefAddressSyntax = getConvention(xDocProps); where getConvention() returns CONV_OOO if the generator was not Microsoft.

At line number 2340, in this method, pImp->m_pInstream is populated from pImp->xStream rather than pImp->xInputStream due to the order of if-else statements. I think that pImp->xStream is uncompressed as I did not set MediaDescriptor::PROP_STREAM property in media descriptor in the detect code.The csv import dialog uses the xInputStream directly where as the ScDocShell::ConvertFrom() uses SvStream from SfxMedium::GetInStream()I tried to reverse the order of if-else statement in SfxMedium::GetMedium_Impl() (starting at line number 2340). But soon realized that it is not correct as1) it breaks some unit tests (import of pdf files failed)2) Though the spreadsheet now shows uncompressed data, the csv import dialog shows empty data !. I thought it was due to file stream position set to the end, but seeking the pImp->xInputStream to the beginning did not solve that.So I reverted this change and instead tried assigning to both MediaDescriptor::PROP_STREAM and MediaDescriptor::PROP_INPUTSTREAM properties in the textdetect filter code as follows :uno::Reference<io::XStream> xStreamDecompressed(new utl::OStreamWrapper(*pDecompressedStream));                                                                                                    aMediaDesc[MediaDescriptor::PROP_STREAM()] <<= xStreamDecompressed;                                                                                                                                aMediaDesc[MediaDescriptor::PROP_INPUTSTREAM()] <<= xStreamDecompressed->getInputStream();This change seems to work, no unit test failed, and uncompressed data in both spreadsheet and csv import dialog.

28216,"Patch Set 3:> Lionel, any response to Michael's review?So, in general terms, the situation is that I stumbledupon broken code while doing something else and Ifixed it. Details:>> possibly this could be replaced by sax::ConverterYes, that seems desirable in the middle-to-long term.However, the name of the function referred to anotherstandard than what sax::Converter aims at, so I consideredit more prudent to fix the code ""locally"", referring to thestandard it purposes to implement, rather than replaceby a call to sax::Converter::parseISO8601 (or some such).Especially since I meant for this to go into our release branch(es).If someone wants to invest the time to merge this withsax::Converter, I agree it would enhance the code qualityof LibreOffice: one (hopefully not buggy) implementationof parsing date/time (that is well-tested because used much,tested by unittests, etc) instead of multiple implementationswith different bugs that possibly show up only in corner cases(and thus linger for a long time before being found).However, that someone is not me, at least not in the shortterm. > I had a look at ""ECMA-376 Part 1 3rd edition"" > (is this the relevant reference?)Dunno. Not my area of expertise. Looks plausible to me. > ST_DateTime (...) W3C XML Schema dateTime datatype > Dates and Time (...) SpreadsheetML (...) ISO 8601-formatted > string > Date (...) SpreadsheetML (...) stored in the ISO 8601 format > however can't find any reference to > http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime in there > where did the idea come from that that was relevant?The function is called GetDateTimeFromW3CDTF. Duckduckgoing(or Googling) for W3CDTF makes it clear that ""W3CDTF"" usuallymeans http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime, so I assumed thatthis was the format the function was supposed to parse. 1) Was the W3CDTF in the function name meant as a reference     to that note? Dunno, ask its author. 2) In that case, was the reference itself an error? Michael's     research seems to indicate this would be the case.IRC (or mailing list?) discussion also basically said that as faras we know, the timezone component of this fix may not mattermuch since Microsoft Office always writes UTC (Zulu) time,so the bug would never get triggered. I think that it is stillpreferable to fix the bug to avoid that other code calls thisfunction in situations where the bug happens.So, my opinion would be:1) As proactive safety, apply this patch to master & 4-1.    (possibly an adapted part of it to 4-0; adapted because    sub-second stuff is different in 4-0: centiseconds instead    of nanoseconds) 2) In master, provided we have a volunteer to unravel that     quagmire (that knows about OOXML or willing to find out     about it), merge with sax::Converter date/time-parsing     if appropriate... If not appropriate, maybe migrate this     function to sax::Converter (along with documentation-by-     comment explaining why we need different parsers for     different formats and the difference between them), so     that our date/time-parsing code is all in one place.Since nobody clearly vetoed this patch, I'm going to push ""1)"" to master soon, unless someone vetoes.",3,21753,2013-08-09 07:44:20,2013-07-05 15:12:51,2013-08-09 06:59:13,0,MERGED,1.0,56.0,2,5,4,negative

36104,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1(1 comment)The idea to merge the two threads (callback handler and tile rendering) is reasonable, but we should discuss the approach.The starvation you noticed happens because you are using the tile-queue, which is designed for... well, yes, tiles! :)It reorders the messages such that it renders tiles in large blocks first. So with heavy typing the callback messages always end up getting overtaken by tiles, which the queue explicitly favors, thereby starving callback events.So this is one problem with the current implementation. I think the tiles should have its own queue, and callbacks a separate one. The thread that pumps them would process one callback, then one tile-rendering.Another issue with combining these threads is that there will be reduction in performance. This is because before and after rendering a tile there is significant work being done that does *not* execute with the Solar lock. This code (mostly encoding to PNG) is CPU intensive and can run in parallel to other code (even to other rendering calls).Finally, I have submitted my patch (342125b8ea) to fix the missing tiles issue. Should be easier to read than describe it here (it's only +27, -6). It comes with detailed commit log too. So this approach is mostly an optimization to reduce the thread-count, but, as mentioned, we need multiple threads because we have opportunity to parallelize, and merging them will reduce performance (unless benchmark proves otherwise, of course).",1,25170,2016-09-23 02:57:05,2016-09-22 19:59:12,2016-09-22 20:49:06,6,ABANDONED,1.0,163.0,2,4,1,negative
36105,"Patch Set 1:Wrt. the starvation - actually that was due to the logging; we have so much debugging stuff that it was blocking considerably when writing to the console, making the queue grow.  Without that, all works fine even with the unmodified TileQueue :-)But I worked on the TileQueue too - it seems unnecessary to do all the priority shuffling when inserting, when the prioritization changes with every view switch, and instead do it only when the tile is requested - which seems to work nicely.Wrt. an own queue for tiles - that is exactly the thing that makes the synchronzation hard, as then it is necessary to synchronize between those 2 queues; which in turn kills all the advantage of 2 queues :-)Wrt. PNG compression; if we want to thread it, then let's thread just the compression - that'll make it local, more maintainable, and we can go with as many threads there as we wish (for just the PNG compression piece of code).Wrt. the 342125b8ea - thanks for that!  Unfortunately that again just adds code :-(Either way, please check https://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/online/log/?h=private/kendy/tilesandcallbacks , I'd really like to get that in...

36282,"Patch Set 1:Hi Kendy,Please look into this and tell me if it is the right way to proceed.This throws the Unknown Property Exception as indicated below.I think we may need to call this setPropertyValue() <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/editeng/source/uno/unofield.cxx#675> instead of the one currently being called <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sw/source/core/unocore/unofield.cxx#2152> which is throwing up an Unknown Property Exception at <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sw/source/core/unocore/unofield.cxx#2165> One is sw's implementation while the other is editeng's implementation. Moggi was of the opinion that the setPropertyValue() from editeng couldn't be called here. But the current one is unable to support that property (UNO_TC_PROP_TEXTFIELD_TYPE). How would it be possible to proceed?I'm influenced by this comment <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/offapi/com/sun/star/text/textfield/Type.idl#19> when I say the above.Also, I did a '#define UNO_NAME_TEXT_FIELD_TYPE ""TextFieldType""' in <opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sw/inc/unoprnms.hxx> taking other properties from here <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/include/editeng/unonames.hxx> as an example. But I'm unsure if this is the right way to proceed.Since I've mentioned '[optional, property]long TextFieldType;' as optional in <opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/offapi/com/sun/star/text/textfield/ExtendedUser.idl>, I might need a boolean to indicate when 'setPropertyValue()' must be called for each of the fields from <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/offapi/com/sun/star/text/textfield/Type.idl> in here <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/xmloff/source/text/txtfldi.cxx#706>. I don't think we need to call it for all 15 properties all the time. How do I use the boolean variable - like for example - how do I use it to indicate when to set EXTENDED_TIME and when not to..?Regarding the comment thread on the bug page - you'd asked what happens when I run it without removing certain stuff from content.xml . The exact same exceptions are thrown in the order of Comment 13 first and then Comment 14.On a side note, I would like to say that I'm doing this coz you'd asked me to work on LO code (with respect to GSoC) and this was a bug reported by you. Since you didn't remember filing this bug, if there is something else that you'd want me to work on, please do tell.I would have loved to work on creating MAR files (from onlineupdate module), and still do think that's the best thing to do as it would mean I would get a headstart when it comes to the actual coding period begin dates, and had sent a mail to you regarding that.

I was a bit upset that the headless patch was merged even though the ESC asked the author not to merge it in its current form. The opengl situation on our Android port is a bit unclear. On one hand, we disable opengl in configure, OTOH it seems we build most of the opengl code in vcl. My commit just restored that status quo, fixing the build. I also verified that the build result actually works. :-)Given that at the end Android uses cairo to render the tiles, the opengl code is not useful on Android. However, probably it's a good idea to not work on removing it from the Android binary till it's not clear if those opengl #ifdefs will go away or not in the long run.

36336,Patch Set 1:(1 comment)So this is going to be an ugly one.We are now hitting a limitation of the current test framework. Currently all our tests don't have access to the UI configuration as it breaks the tests. Now I don't remember why I went the way of pointing the ui path to the user profile but it still seems to be necessary. Back when I wrote that code there were however no UI files so it was still so that the whole UI should have worked. Now with the UI files this is no longer true and pointing the UI config path to a place that does not the UI files causes an exception and later a crash.I will need some time to get back into the details of the configuration management during the tests.,1,25668,2016-03-22 00:18:41,2016-03-21 14:48:24,2016-03-21 14:48:24,9,ABANDONED,3.0,60.0,3,7,2,negative

I made more tests, and the code is still slightly faster (1 to 2%), but i think it is in the error tolerance, and anyways things are really more important than percent... i was talking about saving three seconds over a ten minutes computation. Not really worth it ;)So i will revert to the original code and the functor.Now my question is, do you you have a prefered way to send information between ScColumn::StartListeners and class StartListenersHandler ?My first idea is to add an extra parameters to the constructor, a reference to the column, so it could set the FomulaFlag?

Please start working at the bug you asked about (45904), but there are a couple of BIG BUTs:- please save all the calc (sc) to last- please make your commit message ""converted java test to python""- do NOT refer to the bug in the commit.Background for this, is that we have one person who feels strongly about C++, while the rest of us just want it converted....Your work is really apriciated, and fact is that it will not be done for C++.Looking forward to blog about your camp, keep up the motivation. Please tell the others, that we are all proud of your work.There is at the moment an efford ongoing to organize a formal hackathon (hackfest) in turkey.

He changed outInvish.cxx, (so did I,) but that isn't the point that needed change. The visible page numberings are at SlsSlotManager.cxx and drviewsa.cxx, which do actually the same work, but first one takes effect when the Slides Manager (on the left side) is active, and drviewsa.cxx when the slide editor itself is active.

37417,"Patch Set 3: Fails; I would prefer that you didn't submit thisThe hardest part of this was finding out that X11SalGraphics::GetGlyphBoundRect was involved, so kudos to discovering that.The workaround to search the lower levels if a glyph isn't found however is a bit of a bodge, because I don't think we shuold be asking for the wrong glyphs there in the first place. I think http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/commit/?id=98f56121858b4bea54d056a073005a10648785c6 should work instead.In MultiSalLayout::GetBoundRect we loop through each fallback font and union each level's GetBoundRect to get the result, which seems reasonable, except that for each level that's means a call to SalLayout::GetBoundRect which calls X11SalGraphics::GetGlyphBoundRect.Those sublevels SalLayouts don't know that they are sublevels so they never set the level bits on their glyphs. Which results in X11SalGraphics::GetGlyphBoundRect always searching for that glyph in the level 0 font, so there's a mismatch between the font the SalLayout's are created to use and the font that gets used.Now, SalLayout::GetBoundRect is a fairly simple thing, it just calls GetNextGlyphs 1 by 1 and X11SalGraphics::GetGlyphBoundRect on the result of that.  So I *think* that if we remove the specialized MultiSalLayout::GetBoundRect in favour of the default implementation, then because MultiSalLayout::GetNextGlyphs is specialized to do-the-right-thing and set up the glyph ids correctly, then we bubble the ids down to X11SalGraphics::GetGlyphBoundRect correctly to get it to use the right font and we get the correct bounding size.",3,27824,2013-01-23 14:52:28,2013-01-16 13:26:26,2013-01-16 13:33:33,169,ABANDONED,1.0,21.0,2,3,3,negative

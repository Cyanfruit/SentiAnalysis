1830,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2Yes, the code that makes a selection by indices looks unreachable to me. dbaccess seems to assume that ""by bookmark"" and ""by indices"" are two possibilities and to pass a selection along with a boolean flag to document which one it is. I'm not sure of the reasons for that, or if it is just historical cruft that has no reason to be anymore.I thought about just converting this (potentially unreachable) case to bookmarks, but getting the n_th row's bookmark is not immediately obvious... It requires moving the seek cursor (which can muck with expectations of other code about where the cursor is...).

But my change will neither help nor harm that case :)(I only fixed the reverse, which is that wingdi.h is included before Common.hxx.)And I believe that case doesn't exist now (if they existed, I fixed them).Containing windows headers in postwin.h will help (which I fully support). But even then, once a header that includes wingdi.h (directly or indirectly) is included in the pch, then we still face the same issue. So it's really tricky.Since I was working on pch files, it was this latter case that really made things complicated. The way to avoid that is to never include an uncontained header that leaks in the pch, which is what we do. So the only case that breaks the build is when RGB is defined before Office/Common.hxx, which I patched.Actually, I think what we should do is add #undef RGB to postwin.h (even when currently it's not needed).

12884,Patch Set 4:How big is the chance that this incompatible (IIUC) change breaks external code (and breaks compatibility with AOO for external code)?  Do any benefits of this change outweigh those drawbacks?,4,10862,2015-09-15 19:38:15,2015-09-14 13:58:37,2015-09-15 16:09:42,3,MERGED,3.0,193.0,2,3,4,negative
12913,"Patch Set 6:I had just done ""make offapi.build"" and it was ok.Now, seeing that even Linux build hasn't succeeded, I tried to fix this.The first error made me change vcl/unx/gtk/fpicker/SalGtkFilePicker.hxx, then the second error indicates the fpicker part.In brief, I don't know how to change API only without changing the rest of the code (beginning with Linux part).You talked about UNO implementation, could you be more specific by giving some example files?",6,10885,2015-08-08 11:22:26,2015-07-15 11:24:07,2015-08-08 08:45:26,2,MERGED,3.0,12.0,3,7,14,negative

12951,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1It doesn't work for me. There is still ""Drois Sans"" in new files. Besides that I suggest to modify the usual character styles too to have double strike through (perhaps without the two internet link styles). In addition it would help users, if the display is set to ""Custom styles"".

12952,"Patch Set 1:Yes i set it to Liberation Serif in 'Default Style' and thought that was the only place it was set to Droid Sans, but is seems it is set elsewhere as well, so i'll fix that. Which are the usual character styles that this should be added to (emphasis, strong emphasis)?I dont think there is a means to set it to 'Custom Styles', but i could check with kendy to confirm. Also i'll be added the important paragraph and character styles to the toolbar for easy access.Web view sounds interesting, so i'll enable that.",1,10911,2015-09-12 19:40:21,2015-09-12 07:53:24,2015-09-12 07:53:24,11,MERGED,1.0,0.0,2,4,4,negative

I mentioned this somewhere as a limitation. The reason for this is that the page size is the same, but the margins are removed/reduced. So the text is allowed to fill in more surface area. This could be solved by changing the page dimensions in hide-whitespace mode.

Good to know. The reason I wrote this script is because I have another patch that improves pch generation (a rewrite of update_pch in python that updates every single pch in the codebase in a few seconds). It was obvious to me that to improve the pch generation to make builds faster I had to deal with the problem of conflicting headers (that are excluded from pch) and required headers (that will break the build if left out). This script solves the latter problem, so now what is included in pch headers is purely to accelerate builds, not to prevent the build from breaking.Will submit the update_pch script and updated pch files sometime soon, as time permits.",1,11103,2015-09-03 21:47:25,2015-09-01 00:33:37,2015-09-01 00:33:37,69,MERGED,16.0,378.0,4,6,2,negative

I only submitted when I was confident enough that they won't cause immediate instability (evident from the commit message and the test design/code).

Any chance you can create one ? > Thanks !Depends what you mean by ""work."" The timers of course _do_ work, but that is not the problem I'm fixing. I'm fixing the issue with high idle CPU utilization. Periodic timers should reset their start time so that they re-fire only after the duration has expired. The issue, I found, is that Timer thinks it's ready to fire again at the next tick. Ticks come in for the _soonest_ next timer delay (this is because we really have only one system timer callback, and we need it to fire for the next timer in the queue). In the worst case they come in immediately (after 1ms) and in those cases Timer thinks it's ready to fire again, which it does. This doesn't cause any obvious problems, other than CPU utilization where there shouldn't be any (because Timer handles background jobs, like spellchecking, which wastes some CPU and returns, but the waste is proportional to the document size and number of documents open).It is clear from the code that nowhere is the start-time reset. Of course I had the luxury of debugging and seeing what was happening, but the code and my comments make it almost trivial to trace the variable in question and see that without changing it, it will trick Timer into firing again. (See Timer::ReadyForSchedule where mnUpdateTime is used.)I can add unittest for this but, from experience, timers are not reliable enough to trap them within a reasonable time frame from make the test meaningful. On a non-realtime OS, they come with no guarantees. And they are less consistent across a number of OSes. We can have a crude ""test fire once"" and ""test don't fire too soon"" but it's harder to have ""fired too late."" Also, it's much harder to simulate the myriads of jobs we have and the arbitrary periods of each (and how they overlap).I'll give it a shot, but applying and running a large document with this 1 liner will show that the idle CPU utilization does go to 0.",5,11525,2015-08-17 14:10:40,2015-07-19 17:33:11,2015-07-20 00:08:15,686,MERGED,1.0,3.0,5,7,5,negative

At line number 2340, in this method, pImp->m_pInstream is populated from pImp->xStream rather than pImp->xInputStream due to the order of if-else statements. I think that pImp->xStream is uncompressed as I did not set MediaDescriptor::PROP_STREAM property in media descriptor in the detect code.The csv import dialog uses the xInputStream directly where as the ScDocShell::ConvertFrom() uses SvStream from SfxMedium::GetInStream()I tried to reverse the order of if-else statement in SfxMedium::GetMedium_Impl() (starting at line number 2340). But soon realized that it is not correct as1) it breaks some unit tests (import of pdf files failed)2) Though the spreadsheet now shows uncompressed data, the csv import dialog shows empty data !. I thought it was due to file stream position set to the end, but seeking the pImp->xInputStream to the beginning did not solve that.So I reverted this change and instead tried assigning to both MediaDescriptor::PROP_STREAM and MediaDescriptor::PROP_INPUTSTREAM properties in the textdetect filter code as follows :uno::Reference<io::XStream> xStreamDecompressed(new utl::OStreamWrapper(*pDecompressedStream));                                                                                                    aMediaDesc[MediaDescriptor::PROP_STREAM()] <<= xStreamDecompressed;                                                                                                                                aMediaDesc[MediaDescriptor::PROP_INPUTSTREAM()] <<= xStreamDecompressed->getInputStream();This change seems to work, no unit test failed, and uncompressed data in both spreadsheet and csv import dialog.

The big problem is that it changes the current cursor position and so ""flashes around a lot"" especially when multiple tabs are involved.

The ::find function does work quietly, but adds a ->Select() at the end of the function.

SpreadsheetML (...) stored in the ISO 8601 format > however can't find any reference to > http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime in there > where did the idea come from that that was relevant?The function is called GetDateTimeFromW3CDTF. Duckduckgoing(or Googling) for W3CDTF makes it clear that ""W3CDTF"" usuallymeans http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime, so I assumed thatthis was the format the function was supposed to parse. 1) Was the W3CDTF in the function name meant as a reference     to that note? Dunno, ask its author. 2) In that case, was the reference itself an error? Michael's     research seems to indicate this would be the case.IRC (or mailing list?) discussion also basically said that as faras we know, the timezone component of this fix may not mattermuch since Microsoft Office always writes UTC (Zulu) time,so the bug would never get triggered. I think that it is stillpreferable to fix the bug to avoid that other code calls thisfunction in situations where the bug happens.So, my opinion would be:1) As proactive safety, apply this patch to master & 4-1.    (possibly an adapted part of it to 4-0; adapted because    sub-second stuff is different in 4-0: centiseconds instead    of nanoseconds) 2) In master, provided we have a volunteer to unravel that     quagmire (that knows about OOXML or willing to find out     about it), merge with sax::Converter date/time-parsing     if appropriate... If not appropriate, maybe migrate this     function to sax::Converter (along with documentation-by-     comment explaining why we need different parsers for     different formats and the difference between them), so     that our date/time-parsing code is all in one place.Since nobody clearly vetoed this patch, I'm going to push ""1)"" to master soon, unless someone vetoes.",3,21753,2013-08-09 07:44:20,2013-07-05 15:12:51,2013-08-09 06:59:13,0,MERGED,1.0,56.0,2,5,4,negative

36104,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1(1 comment)The idea to merge the two threads (callback handler and tile rendering) is reasonable, but we should discuss the approach.The starvation you noticed happens because you are using the tile-queue, which is designed for... well, yes, tiles! :)It reorders the messages such that it renders tiles in large blocks first. So with heavy typing the callback messages always end up getting overtaken by tiles, which the queue explicitly favors, thereby starving callback events.So this is one problem with the current implementation. I think the tiles should have its own queue, and callbacks a separate one. The thread that pumps them would process one callback, then one tile-rendering.Another issue with combining these threads is that there will be reduction in performance. This is because before and after rendering a tile there is significant work being done that does *not* execute with the Solar lock. This code (mostly encoding to PNG) is CPU intensive and can run in parallel to other code (even to other rendering calls).Finally, I have submitted my patch (342125b8ea) to fix the missing tiles issue. Should be easier to read than describe it here (it's only +27, -6). It comes with detailed commit log too. So this approach is mostly an optimization to reduce the thread-count, but, as mentioned, we need multiple threads because we have opportunity to parallelize, and merging them will reduce performance (unless benchmark proves otherwise, of course).",1,25170,2016-09-23 02:57:05,2016-09-22 19:59:12,2016-09-22 20:49:06,6,ABANDONED,1.0,163.0,2,4,1,negative

I wasn't able to finish build with android when I wasbuilding 824139e28b3c9e0d448ee8abc580f06a4a434002.I expect this problem was fixed later as 14060e76e33cfb305c1469fecf7db688bf8a8858 gotbuilt fine.For building 824139e28b3c9e0d448ee8abc580f06a4a434002 I also had to disable opengl - patchin https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/#/c/23614/ but this is probably also invalid.,1,25623,2016-03-31 22:23:00,2016-03-29 21:59:27,2016-03-29 22:36:24,47,ABANDONED,1.0,2.0,5,10,1,negative
36321,"Patch Set 1:Is this necessary after 2428e1164b5f38da9fc2f24c5bb478e548f54a6f?Christian, sorry about the brief commit message. I was a bit upset that the headless patch was merged even though the ESC asked the author not to merge it in its current form. The opengl situation on our Android port is a bit unclear. On one hand, we disable opengl in configure, OTOH it seems we build most of the opengl code in vcl. My commit just restored that status quo, fixing the build. I also verified that the build result actually works. :-)Given that at the end Android uses cairo to render the tiles, the opengl code is not useful on Android. However, probably it's a good idea to not work on removing it from the Android binary till it's not clear if those opengl #ifdefs will go away or not in the long run. (Currently we have those ifdefs, but it's possible they will be reverted, it's not clear yet.)",1,25623,2016-04-01 07:04:41,2016-03-29 21:59:27,2016-03-29 22:36:24,56,ABANDONED,1.0,2.0,5,10,1,negative

36336,Patch Set 1:(1 comment)So this is going to be an ugly one.We are now hitting a limitation of the current test framework. Currently all our tests don't have access to the UI configuration as it breaks the tests. Now I don't remember why I went the way of pointing the ui path to the user profile but it still seems to be necessary. Back when I wrote that code there were however no UI files so it was still so that the whole UI should have worked. Now with the UI files this is no longer true and pointing the UI config path to a place that does not the UI files causes an exception and later a crash.I will need some time to get back into the details of the configuration management during the tests.,1,25668,2016-03-22 00:18:41,2016-03-21 14:48:24,2016-03-21 14:48:24,9,ABANDONED,3.0,60.0,3,7,2,negative

37417,"Patch Set 3: Fails; I would prefer that you didn't submit thisThe hardest part of this was finding out that X11SalGraphics::GetGlyphBoundRect was involved, so kudos to discovering that.The workaround to search the lower levels if a glyph isn't found however is a bit of a bodge, because I don't think we shuold be asking for the wrong glyphs there in the first place. I think http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/commit/?id=98f56121858b4bea54d056a073005a10648785c6 should work instead.In MultiSalLayout::GetBoundRect we loop through each fallback font and union each level's GetBoundRect to get the result, which seems reasonable, except that for each level that's means a call to SalLayout::GetBoundRect which calls X11SalGraphics::GetGlyphBoundRect.Those sublevels SalLayouts don't know that they are sublevels so they never set the level bits on their glyphs. Which results in X11SalGraphics::GetGlyphBoundRect always searching for that glyph in the level 0 font, so there's a mismatch between the font the SalLayout's are created to use and the font that gets used.Now, SalLayout::GetBoundRect is a fairly simple thing, it just calls GetNextGlyphs 1 by 1 and X11SalGraphics::GetGlyphBoundRect on the result of that.  So I *think* that if we remove the specialized MultiSalLayout::GetBoundRect in favour of the default implementation, then because MultiSalLayout::GetNextGlyphs is specialized to do-the-right-thing and set up the glyph ids correctly, then we bubble the ids down to X11SalGraphics::GetGlyphBoundRect correctly to get it to use the right font and we get the correct bounding size.",3,27824,2013-01-23 14:52:28,2013-01-16 13:26:26,2013-01-16 13:33:33,169,ABANDONED,1.0,21.0,2,3,3,negative

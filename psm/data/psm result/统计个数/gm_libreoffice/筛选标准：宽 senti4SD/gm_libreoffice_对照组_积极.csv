1266,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1visually, LO round-trips this just fine, and has no problems with it. Only MS-Word indicates any issues, so no unit test is possible.The regression causing this issue covers an oddball situation already, so just avoiding the whole thing within a table seems like the best solution.I never could figure out what is ultimately causing the problem, because dealing with cells is very complicated. I'm pretty sure it was related to the anchor (position 26) being past the end of the string portions(0-23,24,25).

3002,"Patch Set 5: Code-Review-2(1 comment)I advise against hardcoding specific services. Especially when they are only available in a small subset of languages.Letting special cases creep in like the one in flagged in the comment is even worse.Instead of hardcoding the ask site, make it a generic ""find help online"" or similar, that links to the domain specifically created for those kind of links: http://hub.libreoffice.org/something.That in turn can then redirect to language specific resources. (either redirect directly to askbot or show a overview page, depending on language. That then can be maintained/updated independently from LO (you cannot change the hardcoded URLs in a released version of LO after all)so again:* make it a generic page instead (not ""Questions and Answers"" but something like ""Get help online"" or something similar)* all URLs in LibreOffice itself should be http://hub.libreoffice.org/something ones.definite -2 because of the special handling of locales, without it it would still be a fat -1 from me",5,2702,2016-07-12 12:47:46,2016-07-07 22:57:48,2016-07-08 23:10:12,85,MERGED,25.0,72.0,3,6,10,positive

The SVG filter itself is a good thing, it may be used as pattern for other importers. It's basic functionality to convert SVG XML to ODF XML is a good basic functionality, the only reasons to 'park' it now and not to invest more work is that SVGIO is capable of more features, that the XML conversion is limited in getting perfect due to ODF restrictions and that it is too much work to develop both.

11130,Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1Seems reasonable enough I guess - I would name the member variable something sensible; m_aAsyncLoadsInProgress.I'm also really unclear why we erase the item from the hash if it is already there - when requesting the image [ that seems ... odd ] Surely we want to erase that when the async loading has completed (whether it succeeded or failed) - rather than when the 2nd image request is made (what about a 3rd request ?).Anyhow - conceptually loading the same graphic twice does indeed look bogus & good to stop; though whether this is truly the root cause of the freeze is unclear to me =)Thanks.,3,9434,2015-11-20 10:07:08,2015-11-17 00:23:33,2015-11-19 11:02:07,23,MERGED,2.0,14.0,3,5,7,positive

I tried that. And can give it another try. But it would require a much bigger change, obviously. The main problem is that wingdi.h is actually included from other windows headers too. So we can't fully control when it's included. But can give it another shot and narrow it down further. In fact, I spent hours trying to find what file includes the conflicting values to create this patch. > The current fix allows workdir/CustomTarget/officecfg/registry/officecfg/Office/Common.hxx > to be included, but if a source file happens to first include that > officecfg/Office/Common.hxx, then include wingdi.h, and later wants > to acutally use the struct RGB from Common.hxx, it still runs into > a problem.Well, that would be be a problem _only_ if wingdi.h was already included _before_ Office/Common.h, and in that case the build would fail because the macro would conflict with the declaration of RGB (my patch avoids this situation).However, if wingdi.h was _not_ included at the point of #undef RGB, then nothing bad would happen if it is included afterwards. Unless I missed something, I don't see how there would still be a problem, as wingdi.h will define RGB without issue.I should add that I hated this particular line of my patch. I share your view that it's best avoided altogether. But I couldn't find a better solution. Will try again though.",4,9501,2015-11-13 14:47:12,2015-11-11 01:47:58,2015-11-12 10:55:41,27,MERGED,21.0,483.0,2,7,4,positive

And I checked the ODF attribute name, and I *think* that, although there are several other names we could re-use for this purpose, repeat-item-labels is probably reasonable.Now, 2 things remain.  One is that we need a new unit test to cover this new feature.  Hopefully you can pick one of the existing test cases in ucalc_pivottable.cxx as a model and add a new test case.  Another one is that, because we are adding a new attribute that's not yet in the ODF standard, we need to use a different namespace other than 'table:', to make sure that when we export the document it will be a valid ODF.  I *think* you can use either XML_NP_CALC_EXT or XML_NP_LO_EXT for this.  Eike, do you have any advice on which namespace to use?That's all I have to say on this.

That would at least help out any implementations (like LO before this patch) that import zoom percent but not zoom type.In the end, zoom type takes precedence over zoom factor, so I don't think it is important which way we choose, especially since very few people seemed interested in the bug (i.e. no bibisect).",1,15030,2015-01-02 06:26:06,2015-01-02 04:33:08,2015-01-02 04:36:12,1,MERGED,1.0,16.0,3,8,2,positive

32479,"Patch Set 1:This change is related to columns in text sections, not columns for pages. I guess page columns are not exported to HTML because there is really no generally applicable way of doing that; HTML pages do not have fixed height like pages in Writer do.To test this you need to- Open a new empty Writer document- Choose Insert -> Section- Go to Columns tab and type in a number, 3 for example, click Insert.- now you can see the little grey section markers, paste some long text inside those.- save as HTML, you should end up with a HTML document that has a MULTICOL element that contains the column count both in the old non-standard COLS-attribute and in the new css column-count attribute.PS.

PNG compression; if we want to thread it, then let's thread just the compression - that'll make it local, more maintainable, and we can go with as many threads there as we wish (for just the PNG compression piece of code).Wrt. the 342125b8ea - thanks for that!

36282,"Patch Set 1:Hi Kendy,Please look into this and tell me if it is the right way to proceed.This throws the Unknown Property Exception as indicated below.I think we may need to call this setPropertyValue() <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/editeng/source/uno/unofield.cxx#675> instead of the one currently being called <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sw/source/core/unocore/unofield.cxx#2152> which is throwing up an Unknown Property Exception at <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sw/source/core/unocore/unofield.cxx#2165> One is sw's implementation while the other is editeng's implementation. Moggi was of the opinion that the setPropertyValue() from editeng couldn't be called here. But the current one is unable to support that property (UNO_TC_PROP_TEXTFIELD_TYPE). How would it be possible to proceed?I'm influenced by this comment <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/offapi/com/sun/star/text/textfield/Type.idl#19> when I say the above.Also, I did a '#define UNO_NAME_TEXT_FIELD_TYPE ""TextFieldType""' in <opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sw/inc/unoprnms.hxx> taking other properties from here <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/include/editeng/unonames.hxx> as an example. But I'm unsure if this is the right way to proceed.Since I've mentioned '[optional, property]long TextFieldType;' as optional in <opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/offapi/com/sun/star/text/textfield/ExtendedUser.idl>, I might need a boolean to indicate when 'setPropertyValue()' must be called for each of the fields from <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/offapi/com/sun/star/text/textfield/Type.idl> in here <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/xmloff/source/text/txtfldi.cxx#706>. I don't think we need to call it for all 15 properties all the time. How do I use the boolean variable - like for example - how do I use it to indicate when to set EXTENDED_TIME and when not to..?Regarding the comment thread on the bug page - you'd asked what happens when I run it without removing certain stuff from content.xml . The exact same exceptions are thrown in the order of Comment 13 first and then Comment 14.On a side note, I would like to say that I'm doing this coz you'd asked me to work on LO code (with respect to GSoC) and this was a bug reported by you. Since you didn't remember filing this bug, if there is something else that you'd want me to work on, please do tell.I would have loved to work on creating MAR files (from onlineupdate module), and still do think that's the best thing to do as it would mean I would get a headstart when it comes to the actual coding period begin dates, and had sent a mail to you regarding that.

In the toolbar code, the instantiation would look like mpStatusListener  = new WindowStatusListener<ToolBox>(this, "".uno:ImageOrientation"");2) 2nd that actually implements the functionality for the toolbar.3) [optionally] some style clenaup arnoud, but better to avoid doing much of that.Also - is this all that was necessary to be done to fix the problem in the sidebar, or is an additional patch anticipated?Thank you for your work on this! :-) - and sorry about my initial reaction, the stylistic changes + the wrong comment triggered a warning light in my mind ;-)",3,26082,2015-11-27 11:01:08,2015-11-26 15:58:42,2015-11-27 09:11:24,1,ABANDONED,13.0,321.0,3,5,3,positive

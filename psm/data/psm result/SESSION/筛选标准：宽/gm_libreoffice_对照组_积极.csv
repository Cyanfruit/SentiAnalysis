In this case, we need a way so that client applicationscan simulate a formula bar.> Why not update dependent formula cells, conditional formatting and so on?We do not want to update dependent formula cells with each keystroke when theuser is still writing his/her input into the formula bar because these areintermediate values. It could be an incomplete formula or an invalid value whichwould result in throwing error for all dependent cells. We only want to updatethese dependent cells in some particular condition, say pressing enter, informula bar. Hence the distinction in this UNO command now, so that when theuser is just typing, we don't commit the contents to the cell.I tried looking for other ways to accomplish this, but this approach made mostsense to me.

All paragraphs in the text box are aligned to left, so LO ""optimizes"" the text object alignment to left bottom corner, thus disabling full width setting, and breaks the test position.Another approach could be to either allow full width for any horisontal alignment, or to fix incorrect anchoring in case when text height is greater than the rectangle (IMO, the latter is preferable). But that change is much more invasive, and I suppose that removing the optimization (lines 898-922 and 952-976) that uses word ""sensible"", i.e. it's not mandatory, just intended to be more performant (?) in some cases, may be more suitable here.Also, the line 1034 makes some kinds of text objects to auto-align its contents to the box. As may be seen in tdf#41245, that's not correct, so I removed it. If auto-fit is to be used on import, it must be enabled only when PPT specifies that explicitly.And even with the previous fix, some objects keep getting auto-fit flag just because the template specifies that, and that's why I needed to explicitly override it in 1093-1100. If later the auto-fit is to be enabled, it's the place where we should check for PPT (explicit) auto-fit setting, and enable it if set, and keep disabling otherwise.",1,6843,2015/9/27 12:46,2015/9/27 13:45,0,MERGED,1,126,2,4,7,positive

9070,"Patch Set 13:(5 comments)> I didn't notice ScTabViewShell::GetState() warning. But i don't > know how can i handle it.It has a switch where you can handle the commands similar to the Execute method, but this time for the command state. A state of a command is how the UI element (toolbar button, menu item etc.) that bound to this command presented to the user. It can be enabled/disabled, checked/unchecked, its text can dynamically change etc.wrt our case, I see that .uno:FreezePanes is enabled always, even in a read-only doc, and so should be the new commands, so this isn't an issue. What GetState currently does for .uno:FreezePanes is that it sets checked/unchecked state. But I wonder whether we want something similar for the new commands (i.e. detect if the first row/column is frozen and set checked state accordingly), or maybe such indication isn't that useful, and we can just drop the GetState part from tabvwsh.sdi as well.Eike: What do you think on this?",13,7632,2016/1/19 14:32,2016/1/26 10:59,164,MERGED,12,332,4,8,16,positive

9447,Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1(9 comments)So I left a few inline comments.One small design concern. The whole code still assumes that aCol[i] will never return a null pointer.

9448,Patch Set 4:Hmm. That will most likely hurt us later but well we can deal with it then.I had chats with Kohei and Eike and I think the solution that seems to be acceptable to all of us is to use a std::vector<ScColumn*> or std::vector<std::unique_ptr<ScColumn>> with the additional requirement that there are no nullptr entries.This provides us with some benefits compared to the version without the additional requirement and the version based on std::vector<ScColumn>. We don't need to check every entry while iterating through columns (just compare once against std::vector::size) and we don't need to worry that pointers to ScColumn instances become invalid when we insert or remove a column. I hope this helps you for the rest of the work.,4,7893,2016/1/20 7:37,2016/1/22 0:44,41,MERGED,10,290,3,6,9,positive

12424,"Patch Set 3:(1 comment)Thank you for your advice.I also think that the variable name ""aDocumentName"" is very misleading.1. About the insert point to decode URL.As you wrote, I think that the best way to convert is in PasswordDialog ctor.However, to reduce the influence I now was according to the method for the other formats(odf,etc...).For the other formats, probably insert points to decode URL are just before calling the UNO API, Document(MS)PasswordRequest(2). (e.g.   http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sfx2/source/appl/appopen.cxx#245  http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sw/source/filter/ww8/ww8par.cxx#5468)Somehow, those APIs want ""the name of the document""... Therefore, in the case of OOXML, I think that the insert point to decode URL is either within MediaDescriptor::requestAndVerifyDocPassword() in unotools or DocPasswordHelper::requestAndVerifyDocPassword() in comphelper.Because the latter point has a smaller effect, I will modify the patch.(I think in the comphelper, INetURLObject can not be used because of the module dependencies. So, I will call directly rtl::url::decode().)2. About decodeMechanism for converting URL.I tried the two ways of rtl_UriDecodeWithCharset and rtl_UriDecodeToIuriRI, I have attached screen shots to bug report tdf#89694.https://bug-attachments.documentfoundation.org/attachment.cgi?id=113966https://bug-attachments.documentfoundation.org/attachment.cgi?id=113967I used this patch.https://bug-attachments.documentfoundation.org/attachment.cgi?id=113965I think the case in rtl_UriDecodeWithCharset is more user-friendly.If I mistake,  please point out.",3,10153,2015/2/28 8:43,2015/2/28 11:46,3,MERGED,1,5,3,9,6,positive

12473,"Patch Set 1:The related ""prototype visual adjustment"" patch can help you visually confirm this patch's effectiveness.  Otherwise you need to use MS Office.Reviewer ToDos1.)  I added a vertical adjustment variable in PageDesc.  It looks like Writer merges ÔÇ£sectionÔÇØ and ÔÇ£pageÔÇØ into ÔÇ£MSWORD-pageÔÇØ.  Would putting textVerticalAdjustment in Writer's ÔÇ£sectionÔÇØ be more logical from a LO perspective?  (i.e. would it be more natural to center text in a section or on a full page if that feature was ever added to LO.) I was naturally led to pagedesc - I'm not sure where/how I would interface with section instead.2.)  I add two re-use options for vertical adjustment.  One was SdrTextVertAdjust enum - it looks like both calc and draw use it for adjusting vertical alignment already.  Instead I used offapi/com/sun/star/drawing/TextVerticalAdjust.idl  com::star::drawing::TextVerticalAdjust because it was already fully defined as usable for makeAny().

12602,"Patch Set 1:This bug could be exhibiting multiple problems at higher levels, so I'm considering this fix to be a band-aid.  These problems are way above my expertise to comment on or investigate (see the bug report for background information.)1.)  I'd guess that adding support for some InsertObjectXXX toolbar functions registers a binding for a new textsh, which becomes dirty for every key press.  That seems expensive and buggy.  It is these ""outside events"" that are affecting the selection.2.)  I can't even guess at the circumstance that requires the popping of a cursor to cancel a selection.  Why is that code even in wrtsh1?  It seems to have been there since day1 and I have no idea how to identify whether it would be safe to remove it now.3.)  I hope there aren't any ÔÇ£necessary consequencesÔÇØ of calling push/pop that I've lost in bypassing them.  I think my proposed change is the least intrusive method of resolving this MAB quickly.4.)  I'm dancing around with cursorÔåÆHasMark(), shellÔåÆHasSelection() somewhere, and shellÔåÆIsSelection() with cursor presently in a selection.  Am I correct in equating HasSelection with HasMark?

13304,"Patch Set 1:Undo:  I don't see any example code in calc that sets an undo message, and from what I DO see the text is a hard-coded response based on the type of 'edit'.  If I just type regular text, I also only get ""input"" (from InsertText() call) with no extra detail.  So what I have works identically to regular changes, and I don't see ANY ability to set an undo comment. cell editing:  This would need to be done in a totally different section.  In the editsh EXECUTE(), the Alt-X keystroke isn't even being captured when the cell is only selected.  So, effectively Calc is not in edit mode yet, and thus Alt-X doesn't apply.  If the ""cursor"" is either in the cell itself OR in the top editview, then the alt-x function works.  I would expect people to be editing the text when they use Alt-X, not finding an entire cell of data and trying to convert the whole thing.  So I don't think it is necessary to duplicate all of this code to handle that situation.",1,10884,2015/9/14 4:39,2015/9/14 4:39,0,MERGED,3,67,4,8,1,positive

15423,"Patch Set 6:OK - false alarm.  Sorry - I'm making false connections in my mind about what the old code actually did, and all of the situations it messed up.  The old code DID only handle increasing sequential links - just sometimes it ran across the bigger sequence first, and then reversed the logic to matched with the lower one.  It was MY example doc (albeit vml) that actually was numbered in the reverse order and so wouldn't have worked on the old logic. And your test document loaded/looked fine.  So in my mind I'm combining all that plus some things I saw (can't remember all where) about mso-layout-flow-alt indicating a reverse sequence - where the highest number starts the chain instead of ends the chain, but although this alt-flow is put in the grabbag, it is never used.  In the end the lack of reverse chaining is still a (potentially) missing feature, not a regression.",6,12582,2015/6/30 9:55,2015/7/1 12:19,26,MERGED,6,159,4,8,6,positive

I wanted to make all functions using GetSortArray() and GetNumberSequenceArray() to accept inline text arrays representing dates. I made attachments for both tdf89872 and tdf88547 containing a bit of both types of function calls.These attachments give the same result in Excel as in Calc (with this patch set).I have not tested Excel with inline text arrays like {""1"",""3"",""4""}; my patch will accept this.IMHO the sort of patch you suggest will keep a difference between Excel and Calc and therefor will lead to a bug report sooner or later.

17441,"Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1The basic idea is a good one here. Clearly the ScHorizontalAttrIter is used in a ton of places across the code-base, particularly in filters, and making it ~instant for all the common big-data cases is very helpful.The basic approach looks good too - the nMinNextEnd looks sensible to detect large runs of identical formatting.What doesn't convince me that much is the initialization and management of the pPrevColEnd array. It looks like that is not initialized initially [sic] ;-) and then there is an assumption that:                if ( bRepeatedRow )                    nCol = pPrevColEnd[nCol];-but- (AFAICS) there is no guarentee that pPrevColEnd[nCol] is setup correctly - it rather depends on the value of nCol that was used last time - which (in turn) depends on the shape of the data.So - I would suggest adopting a different approach for generating and managing that - along with some nicer data structure for this case. IIWY I'd detect the case where there is a large run of identical styles - and in that case do more work to analyze them into a complete structure - that can be re-used for several subsequent rows; eg. if there are > 2x rows with the same thing - then allocate & fill that structure in (eg.).Is that do-able ? hopefully it'll make the code flow more pleasant too =)I'd also like to see a unit test created for the case that looks like it should fail in the above =) where we have constant patterns down a run - but a random layout of cell content.Thanks !",3,14212,2015/2/18 0:36,2015/2/18 0:36,0,MERGED,2,51,2,3,6,positive

18112,"Patch Set 4:> of course no STL algorithms that depend on the ordering must be run in such a situation; do you have a concrete example that triggers an assert?Yes. As I said, I have reproduced it. It's not theoretical. Unfortunately, the doc that triggers it is impossible to share (it's private).The assertion happens as a result of calling Delete (line 2853) after entering the loop under ""// change all attributes with key i"". That loop (line 2862-2871) modifies the items of the sorted_vector. If that large loop in that function has more entries to merge, it hits Delete on line 2853 a second time, which calls GetStartOf, which searches for the SwTxtAttr* via lower_bound in the sorted_vector (which might fail because the items are no longer sorted, but asserts in dbgutil builds).The only downside to my fix is the potential performance hit, but I don't see any obvious fixes that prevents the issue, so correctness first.",4,14741,2015/1/18 22:35,2015/1/19 21:46,23,MERGED,1,10,3,6,7,positive

19436,"Patch Set 3:Hi Mikos, I don't understand how export tests were done. That's why I did it in a more conservative way, putting it in import tests.It is my concern that numbering types are not one to one mapping. A sequence like import, export, import lose information by nature. For example there are many cases fallback into NUMBER_LOWER_ZH. However it seems that the patchset for rtfexport can compile ( did it ever make check? ) , It contradict my guess.",3,15875,2014/11/8 15:45,2014/11/9 21:42,29,MERGED,10,104,3,6,3,positive

Isn't it enough to re-use the GETFOCUS_TAB here too?Also about removing if(GETFOCUS_TAB & GetGetFocusFlags()) - what now happens when you click there; won't it lead to extra focusing and unfocusing?  Or is that unrelated?The rest is nitpicking :-) - if we really need GETFOCUS_F6, it should be 0x0800, not 0x1000.  PreNotify() should return true's, not 1's.Thanks so much - and sorry the review took so long; -1's for now, hope that's OK, please set back to 0 when you upload a new patch at some stage.",3,19694,2014/1/17 1:08,2014/1/19 9:28,56,MERGED,7,97,2,7,5,positive

30461,Patch Set 1:Hi I made some enhancements to the svgfilter.I removed some strange code pieces like:   if( mrFilterData.getLength() > 6 )        mrFilterData[ 6 ].Value >>= bRet;Its not good to use a fixed order that is nowhere specified. If a PropertyValue is provided the name should be used.And its now possible to use the SvgWriter and provide FilterData.I hope you can cherry pick my patch for LO 4.1,1,22387,2013/6/29 13:52,2013/6/29 13:52,0,MERGED,6,173,1,1,3,positive

First one is that, we do use the 'b' prefix for boolean variables, so your aProceedHyperlink should actually be bProceedHyperlink.  The second one is that, it's probably better to return the function when bProceedHyperlink is false, which would make the code a bit easier to follow.  Anyway, since this is your first patch submission, I'll make these changes for you. :-)",1,23573,2013/3/23 19:29,2013/3/23 19:52,0,MERGED,1,59,1,3,3,positive

38174,Patch Set 1:(1 comment)So this is going to be an ugly one.We are now hitting a limitation of the current test framework. Currently all our tests don't have access to the UI configuration as it breaks the tests. Now I don't remember why I went the way of pointing the ui path to the user profile but it still seems to be necessary. Back when I wrote that code there were however no UI files so it was still so that the whole UI should have worked. Now with the UI files this is no longer true and pointing the UI config path to a place that does not the UI files causes an exception and later a crash.I will need some time to get back into the details of the configuration management during the tests.,1,25668,2016/3/21 14:48,2016/3/21 14:48,0,ABANDONED,3,60,3,7,2,positive

I had a look now, but didn't find code which would just accept system specific local paths, as there seems to be no system setting for FSYS_*, as FSYS_DETECT will - as far as my fast gimplse at the code told me - happily accept file URLs in any system notation, if you pass FSYS_DETECT.And there are a lot more users of osl::FileBase::getFileURLFromSystemPath, which expect a local path right from the start. Some expect to use the input path, if it's correct, while others want the GetMainURL().

38485,"Patch Set 1:I understand that we want to remove setting the MapModes, I'm just saying that I think that during the conversion process we should ensure that the actual MapMode is HMMs, so the code works in HMMs, and when we change the internal calculations to be HMMs we'll just have to remove one SetMapMode from the beginning of the drawing code.What I don't understand is where is the current MapMode changes to TWIPS from HMMs in DrawFrame. I was trying to use PixelToLogic to convert the vertices of a polygon, but it was not working, and the reason was that somehow the MapMode changes between the call site of DrawFrame and the middle of DrawRotatedFrame. That's the reason why I added it here:https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/#/c/17276/1/sc/source/ui/view/output.cxx@1666I want to remove it but I don't know how to calculate the vertices otherwise, or where the MapMode is changed.

This would also avoid the from my POV unacceptable double definition of StartColor/EndColor.In general it can be done to extend all 'classic' gradients to gradient stops (modular), but is questionable - evtl. implementing the SVG gradient definitions and using these if needed would be superiour.

39784,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1(1 comment)Hi Yogesh, thanks for looking into this.I was worried about the change to wrtw8sty.cxx so I had a bit of a look at the bug myself to understand it better.  I found two different issues which contribute:- the import from docx appears to have a bug which is at play here: when I open the docx in LibreOffice I see that the first page footer has wrong spacing. This affects the export code which tries to join chained page styles into a single word section if they match.  The import bug means that they do not match, so it will try to export this as two different word sections.- however some code recently added to ww8/ww8atr.cxx in a31fbb53dba7 prevents the output of a new section at the page break in this case, as the paragraph on the first page is empty             if( isTextNodeEmpty )                bNewPageDesc = false;So I think these are the two issues that need to be addressed, rather than the change proposed in this item.

I'd rather call it""wallclock time"" because Time/DateTime fields and cell values so farcontain a time not bound to any region. Setting/getting those via UNOAPI always assumed that. Reading/writing ODF assumes it. Passing an UTCtime with IsTimeZoned=true will make existing unchanged code assume theUTC time to be wallclock time instead.To me the IsTimeZoned member doesn't make much sense other than if it isset to false. The application does not know the actual offset, no matterif we define a) true==local_time_with_timezone or b)true==UTC_with_timezone, it will always use the current offsetusing/displaying different values in different timezones for b) orcalculating different UTC for a). For only this reason b) would bebetter because the actual used value would be UTC converted to currentlocal time. But then, if that is wanted, why not useDateTimeWithTimeZone and TimeZone=0 ?Btw, I'm tempted to rename the structs and members and .idl to not useTimeZone but Timezone instead.

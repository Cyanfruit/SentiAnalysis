When an ScAttrArray object is constructed, by default it is set empty that is,  pData <- nullptr and nCount <- 0which is indicative of the default format. If default formatting is stored inScTable instance, for a new document if user adds new content for say first N columnswithout any formatting, then the first N ScColumn instances of ScAttrArray will getcreated by copying the default formatting from the ScTable instance. This can be avoidedby making ScTable's ScAttrArray instance be empty by default indicating default formatting.But the penalty is we have to add special cases everywhere for ScAttrArray methods. But I am not sure if we want this. Should we revert to ScTable instance storing the def.formatting ? - it would make the code simpler.",3,278,2016/4/15 16:13,2016/8/5 7:31,2679,MERGED,12,578,5,18,5,negative

Just to clarify regarding the nCol != -1 check, we need to let methods like Reset(), SetPatternArea(), ApplyStyleArea() to be called for the aNextColAttrArray but *without* changing any document content. An alternative to nCol != -1 checks is that we can have a default parameter or data member called bUnallocated with default value = false for all such methods and use that instead of (nCol != -1) when calling from aNextColAttrArray. Would that be better at least in terms of readability of the code ?In the meantime I will fix the other issues as per your comments.

417,"Patch Set 3:vmiklos: I was planning to re-enable that code once the flip switches for the default to be true, and not false.  That's why I left in that line of code. I thought it would be better to leave all of this compat code in than to rip it all out just to find out that compat is needed for some reason.  There is a TON of code that could be removed if one really wants to strip all of this ""require a border"" code.  But that sounds like a LO5.6 task.The first patch in 5.4 will be one with this comment:tdf41542 globally allow padding without borders: UIThis is the primary fix for tdf#41542 - enabling the UI to adjust thepadding without requiring an enabled border line.  This effectively changesALLOW_PADDING_WITHOUT_BORDERS into a preventative compatibility settinginstead of an enabling one.If an AllowPaddingWithoutBorders=false case is ever found, additional codewill be needed to send the SID_ALLOW_PADDING_WITHOUT_BORDERS setting foreach type of border (page, paragraph, image etc). It currently is only setupfor frames. see commit f013d4a1f4073cda735befd6e446bee35f3db65cThat patch will remove out the comment and add back in the commented out code.",3,472,2016/10/31 8:59,2016/10/31 17:05,8,MERGED,3,16,3,5,5,negative

Ideally eventually it can be fixed...I don't take reverting a unit test lightly, but this one has always been a complete thorn and I'm convinced that keeping in the code that allows it to currently pass is detrimental.  Thus the slightly modified unit test which looks terrible on released versions of 5.x, and mostly correct with all the changes in 5.3.  It certainly is WRONG before this patch hits, so it is a toss-up of one unit test verses another.With the regular page-break, it would be possible to switch to the follow style at that point (which in some cases would be too late, but better than nothing), but doing so has given me round-trip problems that I haven't been able to solve yet.

But it's not a trivial change, and it has been always like this, so not urgent... :-)The fact that in RTF it's OK to specify table properties after the contents of the table, while OOXML specifies it before (and because of this, the RTF tokenizer has to buffer the table contents) is just a cherry on the ""cake"".",2,1590,2016/9/26 13:32,2016/9/27 6:55,17,MERGED,2,80,2,2,2,negative

I didn't want to make it more awkward by injecting member selection into a monstrous expression.What I wanted to achieve is easier debugging.",4,1678,2016/9/20 17:51,2016/9/21 16:02,22,MERGED,42,871,2,4,5,negative

1836,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2Yes, the code that makes a selection by indices looks unreachable to me. dbaccess seems to assume that ""by bookmark"" and ""by indices"" are two possibilities and to pass a selection along with a boolean flag to document which one it is. I'm not sure of the reasons for that, or if it is just historical cruft that has no reason to be anymore.I thought about just converting this (potentially unreachable) case to bookmarks, but getting the n_th row's bookmark is not immediately obvious... It requires moving the seek cursor (which can muck with expectations of other code about where the cursor is...). The safest would be to make a clone of the resultset and use that to get a bookmark,Anyway, this change is good to go as far as I'm concerned.",1,1706,2016/9/20 9:25,2016/9/20 12:32,3,MERGED,1,35,4,5,1,negative

I, or may be > someone else, might pass actual Media Path there.Come on, you can do it ;-) it is trivial by now, when you got this farImplement a new method of MediaControl class, e.g. implUpdateURLField (it could take OUString as an argument). It should do mpMediaPath->SetText($some_url), where $some_url you're going to obtain from maItem (avmedia::MediaItem) member variable, by simply calling its getURL() method.

2385,"Patch Set 2:I'm unable to get the resize function to work. Other mentioned things can be quite easily implemented. The problem is that the media URL is not set the time when we setText() mpMediaPath to ""Insert Media Path Here"". Although media URL is set by the time setState() is called, but I'm only able to update the text of mpMediaPath from there but not the width, which results in cutoff text/overlapping elements. I had implemented this taking into consideration, the example of <TextEdit>mpTimeEdit, which seemed similar in function that it displayed some text. But, it never needs to change it's width, when set once. Not so with mpMediaPath. If there is any example of a <TextEdit>/<FixedText> that updates it's width during runtime, I might be able to do this in a similar way.",2,2169,2016/8/20 10:02,2016/8/22 4:31,42,MERGED,3,34,3,8,4,negative

3038,"Patch Set 5: Code-Review-2(1 comment)I advise against hardcoding specific services. Especially when they are only available in a small subset of languages.Letting special cases creep in like the one in flagged in the comment is even worse.Instead of hardcoding the ask site, make it a generic ""find help online"" or similar, that links to the domain specifically created for those kind of links: http://hub.libreoffice.org/something.That in turn can then redirect to language specific resources. (either redirect directly to askbot or show a overview page, depending on language. That then can be maintained/updated independently from LO (you cannot change the hardcoded URLs in a released version of LO after all)so again:* make it a generic page instead (not ""Questions and Answers"" but something like ""Get help online"" or something similar)* all URLs in LibreOffice itself should be http://hub.libreoffice.org/something ones.definite -2 because of the special handling of locales, without it it would still be a fat -1 from me",5,2702,2016/7/7 22:57,2016/7/8 23:10,24,MERGED,25,72,3,6,10,negative

It could be an incomplete formula or an invalid value whichwould result in throwing error for all dependent cells. We only want to updatethese dependent cells in some particular condition, say pressing enter, informula bar. Hence the distinction in this UNO command now, so that when theuser is just typing, we don't commit the contents to the cell.I tried looking for other ways to accomplish this, but this approach made mostsense to me.

6102,Patch Set 3:But the big question is why we would need a new file format for that and can not use the user data part of the existing BIFF5 filter?For now it looks like a lot of code for something that should be easily detectable in the code and I would not even mind showing a dialog when we don't find a CODEPAGE entry. BIFF5 files are quite rare compared to BIFF8.So what does speak against using the normal BIFF5 filter (should be the MS Excel 95 filter) and if during import we don't discover a CODEPAGE entry and one is provided on the command line that we use that value. For the UI we can always ask for a selection.,3,5255,2016/5/15 22:31,2016/5/15 22:31,0,MERGED,18,113,3,6,5,negative

8077,"Patch Set 1:The problem in tdf#93124 is the following:1. The title text is aligned vertically to bottom, and its height is greater than its rectangle.2. In this case, when text isn't aligned to full width of the object, it ignores the vertical anchor setting (be it to middle or bottom), and aligns vertically to top. So, to retain correct position, the text must be aligned to full width.3. Full width alignment is only available when horisontal alignment is to center.4. All paragraphs in the text box are aligned to left, so LO ""optimizes"" the text object alignment to left bottom corner, thus disabling full width setting, and breaks the test position.Another approach could be to either allow full width for any horisontal alignment, or to fix incorrect anchoring in case when text height is greater than the rectangle (IMO, the latter is preferable). But that change is much more invasive, and I suppose that removing the optimization (lines 898-922 and 952-976) that uses word ""sensible"", i.e. it's not mandatory, just intended to be more performant (?) in some cases, may be more suitable here.Also, the line 1034 makes some kinds of text objects to auto-align its contents to the box. As may be seen in tdf#41245, that's not correct, so I removed it. If auto-fit is to be used on import, it must be enabled only when PPT specifies that explicitly.And even with the previous fix, some objects keep getting auto-fit flag just because the template specifies that, and that's why I needed to explicitly override it in 1093-1100. If later the auto-fit is to be enabled, it's the place where we should check for PPT (explicit) auto-fit setting, and enable it if set, and keep disabling otherwise.",1,6843,2015/9/27 12:46,2015/9/27 13:45,0,MERGED,1,126,2,4,7,positive

9070,"Patch Set 13:(5 comments)> I didn't notice ScTabViewShell::GetState() warning. But i don't > know how can i handle it.It has a switch where you can handle the commands similar to the Execute method, but this time for the command state. A state of a command is how the UI element (toolbar button, menu item etc.) that bound to this command presented to the user. It can be enabled/disabled, checked/unchecked, its text can dynamically change etc.wrt our case, I see that .uno:FreezePanes is enabled always, even in a read-only doc, and so should be the new commands, so this isn't an issue. What GetState currently does for .uno:FreezePanes is that it sets checked/unchecked state. But I wonder whether we want something similar for the new commands (i.e. detect if the first row/column is frozen and set checked state accordingly), or maybe such indication isn't that useful, and we can just drop the GetState part from tabvwsh.sdi as well.Eike: What do you think on this?",13,7632,2016/1/19 14:32,2016/1/26 10:59,164,MERGED,12,332,4,8,16,positive

So the standard paper mentions exactly our test case:  namespace A {      namespace N {          void f();      }  }  void A::N::f() {      i = 5;      // The following scopes are searched for a declaration of i:      // 1) outermost block scope of A::N::f, before the use of i      // 2) scope of namespace N      // 3) scope of namespace A      // 4) global scope, before the definition of A::N::f  }where A::N is connectivity::mork. So according to the standard the declaration of i (ORowSetValue)) should be searched in connectivity namespace, where it's located. So this is clearly a MSVC bug.",4,7728,2016/2/4 20:17,2016/2/11 22:59,170,MERGED,22,200,2,4,4,negative

9447,Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1(9 comments)So I left a few inline comments.One small design concern. The whole code still assumes that aCol[i] will never return a null pointer.

9448,Patch Set 4:Hmm. That will most likely hurt us later but well we can deal with it then.I had chats with Kohei and Eike and I think the solution that seems to be acceptable to all of us is to use a std::vector<ScColumn*> or std::vector<std::unique_ptr<ScColumn>> with the additional requirement that there are no nullptr entries.This provides us with some benefits compared to the version without the additional requirement and the version based on std::vector<ScColumn>. We don't need to check every entry while iterating through columns (just compare once against std::vector::size) and we don't need to worry that pointers to ScColumn instances become invalid when we insert or remove a column. I hope this helps you for the rest of the work.,4,7893,2016/1/20 7:37,2016/1/22 0:44,41,MERGED,10,290,3,6,9,positive

Upload some real samples that generated by other software, Word for example, and describe the expected and observed result.

12424,"Patch Set 3:(1 comment)Thank you for your advice.I also think that the variable name ""aDocumentName"" is very misleading.1. About the insert point to decode URL.As you wrote, I think that the best way to convert is in PasswordDialog ctor.However, to reduce the influence I now was according to the method for the other formats(odf,etc...).For the other formats, probably insert points to decode URL are just before calling the UNO API, Document(MS)PasswordRequest(2). (e.g.   http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sfx2/source/appl/appopen.cxx#245  http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sw/source/filter/ww8/ww8par.cxx#5468)Somehow, those APIs want ""the name of the document""... Therefore, in the case of OOXML, I think that the insert point to decode URL is either within MediaDescriptor::requestAndVerifyDocPassword() in unotools or DocPasswordHelper::requestAndVerifyDocPassword() in comphelper.Because the latter point has a smaller effect, I will modify the patch.(I think in the comphelper, INetURLObject can not be used because of the module dependencies. So, I will call directly rtl::url::decode().)2. About decodeMechanism for converting URL.I tried the two ways of rtl_UriDecodeWithCharset and rtl_UriDecodeToIuriRI, I have attached screen shots to bug report tdf#89694.https://bug-attachments.documentfoundation.org/attachment.cgi?id=113966https://bug-attachments.documentfoundation.org/attachment.cgi?id=113967I used this patch.https://bug-attachments.documentfoundation.org/attachment.cgi?id=113965I think the case in rtl_UriDecodeWithCharset is more user-friendly.If I mistake,  please point out.",3,10153,2015/2/28 8:43,2015/2/28 11:46,3,MERGED,1,5,3,9,6,positive

12473,"Patch Set 1:The related ""prototype visual adjustment"" patch can help you visually confirm this patch's effectiveness.  Otherwise you need to use MS Office.Reviewer ToDos1.)  I added a vertical adjustment variable in PageDesc.  It looks like Writer merges ÔÇ£sectionÔÇØ and ÔÇ£pageÔÇØ into ÔÇ£MSWORD-pageÔÇØ.  Would putting textVerticalAdjustment in Writer's ÔÇ£sectionÔÇØ be more logical from a LO perspective?  (i.e. would it be more natural to center text in a section or on a full page if that feature was ever added to LO.) I was naturally led to pagedesc - I'm not sure where/how I would interface with section instead.2.)  I add two re-use options for vertical adjustment.  One was SdrTextVertAdjust enum - it looks like both calc and draw use it for adjusting vertical alignment already.  Instead I used offapi/com/sun/star/drawing/TextVerticalAdjust.idl  com::star::drawing::TextVerticalAdjust because it was already fully defined as usable for makeAny().

12602,"Patch Set 1:This bug could be exhibiting multiple problems at higher levels, so I'm considering this fix to be a band-aid.  These problems are way above my expertise to comment on or investigate (see the bug report for background information.)1.)  I'd guess that adding support for some InsertObjectXXX toolbar functions registers a binding for a new textsh, which becomes dirty for every key press.  That seems expensive and buggy.  It is these ""outside events"" that are affecting the selection.2.)  I can't even guess at the circumstance that requires the popping of a cursor to cancel a selection.  Why is that code even in wrtsh1?  It seems to have been there since day1 and I have no idea how to identify whether it would be safe to remove it now.3.)  I hope there aren't any ÔÇ£necessary consequencesÔÇØ of calling push/pop that I've lost in bypassing them.  I think my proposed change is the least intrusive method of resolving this MAB quickly.4.)  I'm dancing around with cursorÔåÆHasMark(), shellÔåÆHasSelection() somewhere, and shellÔåÆIsSelection() with cursor presently in a selection.  Am I correct in equating HasSelection with HasMark?  Otherwise, the fix could be further limited to IsSelection.",1,10307,2015/10/3 6:35,2015/10/3 6:56,0,MERGED,1,10,2,5,5,positive

So USING_X11!=TRUE turns out to be equivalent to with_x==no. Unless I miss something;)In theory one could also imagine building a LibreOffice for Windows or OS X that would not use any display-oriented APIs, but that would be fairly pointless, as that functionality is always present in the OS anyway.

13304,"Patch Set 1:Undo:  I don't see any example code in calc that sets an undo message, and from what I DO see the text is a hard-coded response based on the type of 'edit'.  If I just type regular text, I also only get ""input"" (from InsertText() call) with no extra detail.  So what I have works identically to regular changes, and I don't see ANY ability to set an undo comment. cell editing:  This would need to be done in a totally different section.  In the editsh EXECUTE(), the Alt-X keystroke isn't even being captured when the cell is only selected.  So, effectively Calc is not in edit mode yet, and thus Alt-X doesn't apply.  If the ""cursor"" is either in the cell itself OR in the top editview, then the alt-x function works.  I would expect people to be editing the text when they use Alt-X, not finding an entire cell of data and trying to convert the whole thing.  So I don't think it is necessary to duplicate all of this code to handle that situation.",1,10884,2015/9/14 4:39,2015/9/14 4:39,0,MERGED,3,67,4,8,1,positive

15423,"Patch Set 6:OK - false alarm.  Sorry - I'm making false connections in my mind about what the old code actually did, and all of the situations it messed up.  The old code DID only handle increasing sequential links - just sometimes it ran across the bigger sequence first, and then reversed the logic to matched with the lower one.  It was MY example doc (albeit vml) that actually was numbered in the reverse order and so wouldn't have worked on the old logic. And your test document loaded/looked fine.  So in my mind I'm combining all that plus some things I saw (can't remember all where) about mso-layout-flow-alt indicating a reverse sequence - where the highest number starts the chain instead of ends the chain, but although this alt-flow is put in the grabbag, it is never used.  In the end the lack of reverse chaining is still a (potentially) missing feature, not a regression.",6,12582,2015/6/30 9:55,2015/7/1 12:19,26,MERGED,6,159,4,8,6,positive

This is currently the state, it would be wonderful to keep it like that. :-)I've now fixed the problem this patch exposed (see commit 6a71fc9e48654d80f9545f43066ca56103d0cf65), but it would be even better to catch those issues before the patch hits master.Thanks a lot, and for submitting/reviewing patches,Miklos",11,13362,2015/4/16 13:54,2015/5/9 19:55,558,MERGED,5,133,1,1,11,negative

16705,"Patch Set 1:(All mentioned C++ functions are member of SCInterpreter)Creating a slightly different version of GetNumberSequenceArray() will make functions like WORKDAY.INTL and NETWORKDAYS.INTL to work with inline text arrays representing dates.But it will prevent e.g. function MEDIAN to work with inline text arrays representing dates, which is the case with Excel.That's why I used one version of GetNumberSequenceArray(). I wanted to make all functions using GetSortArray() and GetNumberSequenceArray() to accept inline text arrays representing dates. I made attachments for both tdf89872 and tdf88547 containing a bit of both types of function calls.These attachments give the same result in Excel as in Calc (with this patch set).I have not tested Excel with inline text arrays like {""1"",""3"",""4""}; my patch will accept this.IMHO the sort of patch you suggest will keep a difference between Excel and Calc and therefor will lead to a bug report sooner or later. Better discuss this now, don't you agree?",1,13596,2015/3/12 12:10,2015/3/12 12:14,0,MERGED,1,16,3,11,3,positive

17441,"Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1The basic idea is a good one here. Clearly the ScHorizontalAttrIter is used in a ton of places across the code-base, particularly in filters, and making it ~instant for all the common big-data cases is very helpful.The basic approach looks good too - the nMinNextEnd looks sensible to detect large runs of identical formatting.What doesn't convince me that much is the initialization and management of the pPrevColEnd array. It looks like that is not initialized initially [sic] ;-) and then there is an assumption that:                if ( bRepeatedRow )                    nCol = pPrevColEnd[nCol];-but- (AFAICS) there is no guarentee that pPrevColEnd[nCol] is setup correctly - it rather depends on the value of nCol that was used last time - which (in turn) depends on the shape of the data.So - I would suggest adopting a different approach for generating and managing that - along with some nicer data structure for this case. IIWY I'd detect the case where there is a large run of identical styles - and in that case do more work to analyze them into a complete structure - that can be re-used for several subsequent rows; eg. if there are > 2x rows with the same thing - then allocate & fill that structure in (eg.).Is that do-able ? hopefully it'll make the code flow more pleasant too =)I'd also like to see a unit test created for the case that looks like it should fail in the above =) where we have constant patterns down a run - but a random layout of cell content.Thanks !",3,14212,2015/2/18 0:36,2015/2/18 0:36,0,MERGED,2,51,2,3,6,positive

18112,"Patch Set 4:> of course no STL algorithms that depend on the ordering must be run in such a situation; do you have a concrete example that triggers an assert?Yes. As I said, I have reproduced it. It's not theoretical. Unfortunately, the doc that triggers it is impossible to share (it's private).The assertion happens as a result of calling Delete (line 2853) after entering the loop under ""// change all attributes with key i"". That loop (line 2862-2871) modifies the items of the sorted_vector. If that large loop in that function has more entries to merge, it hits Delete on line 2853 a second time, which calls GetStartOf, which searches for the SwTxtAttr* via lower_bound in the sorted_vector (which might fail because the items are no longer sorted, but asserts in dbgutil builds).The only downside to my fix is the potential performance hit, but I don't see any obvious fixes that prevents the issue, so correctness first.",4,14741,2015/1/18 22:35,2015/1/19 21:46,23,MERGED,1,10,3,6,7,positive

18459,"Patch Set 1:In the previous code, the zoom scale factor was ONLY saved when the zoom type was percent mode, not page width, full page etc.  I kept that logic intact - as it seems more correct logically.However, Microsoft Office ALWAYS saves the zoom scale factor.  So it could also be correct to do it that way.  That would at least help out any implementations (like LO before this patch) that import zoom percent but not zoom type.In the end, zoom type takes precedence over zoom factor, so I don't think it is important which way we choose, especially since very few people seemed interested in the bug (i.e. no bibisect).",1,15030,2015/1/2 4:33,2015/1/2 4:36,0,MERGED,1,16,3,8,2,negative

That's why I did it in a more conservative way, putting it in import tests.It is my concern that numbering types are not one to one mapping.

However it seems that the patchset for rtfexport can compile ( did it ever make check? ) , It contradict my guess.",3,15875,2014/11/8 15:45,2014/11/9 21:42,29,MERGED,10,104,3,6,3,positive

24141,"Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1Thank you for the patch!  I wonder - do we have to introduce a new flag?  Isn't it enough to re-use the GETFOCUS_TAB here too?Also about removing if(GETFOCUS_TAB & GetGetFocusFlags()) - what now happens when you click there; won't it lead to extra focusing and unfocusing?  Or is that unrelated?The rest is nitpicking :-) - if we really need GETFOCUS_F6, it should be 0x0800, not 0x1000.  PreNotify() should return true's, not 1's.Thanks so much - and sorry the review took so long; -1's for now, hope that's OK, please set back to 0 when you upload a new patch at some stage.",3,19694,2014/1/17 1:08,2014/1/19 9:28,56,MERGED,7,97,2,7,5,positive

24541,"Patch Set 1:The tablet-layout itself is OK with the 50:50 split, but I kind of disagree with making the font larger also for the small-screen layouts. There doesn't seem to be a reason for this, as you hold the device in your hand to make use of it as a remote, so it is close to your eyes.And the 12sp is actaully rendering the text smaller than default (at least in the preview in eclipse) - sure about that? I'd probably use 22sp for tablets - that would correspond to ""large"" font size according to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11590538/dpi-value-of-default-large-medium-and-small-text-views-androidBut I'd leave the size for phones at it's current value (and rather tweak the horizontal padding/spacing to maximize the usable screen-estate)",1,19993,2013/12/16 18:30,2013/12/16 18:33,0,MERGED,4,95,2,2,5,negative

(""What /are/ the invariants of that code?"" people will start to ask, seeing a mixture of redundant and non-redundant checks.)Given that the original code did not check for validity of accessing index 0, that could either mean that it was sloppy and ""cleverly"" relied on the fact that both String and OUString are null-terminated, so accessing index 0 is always valid technically (and the check for '*' guaranteed to fail for the empty string), or that there's an invariant enforcing aField to be non-empty anyway.Only in the first case would patch set 2 be an improvement.

36434,Patch Set 1:The reason why this change is a good thing is that being able to define conditional formats without ranges and later storing them in ScConditionalFormatList may result in crashes.Calc core always assumes non-empty conditional format ranges because they have to be kept in sync with the cell attribute storage. Inside ScConditionalFormatList::UpdateReference we will additionally delete ScConditionalFormat instances with an empty range. I also added a check to xmlcondformat.cxx that removes all conditional formats that are imported without a range to prevent a crash.The idea is to add for 4.1 an error dialog that makes clear that you either have to define a range or use Cancel. This is however not possible in 4-0 because of the string-freeze.,1,24550,2013/1/18 14:07,2013/1/20 10:24,44,MERGED,3,27,2,3,2,negative

37551,"Patch Set 6: Code-Review+1I have to *strongly* disagree. LibreOffice is unique in its definition of ""offset"" - anyone coming from Microsoft Word or another program is going to expect the behavior I outlined. The old behavior lends no benefit to the user whatsoever, whereas the new behavior does.Also, the ""current"" way of ""starting on a custom page"" is extremely difficult for many users to understand and implement, and is somewhat unreliable in its nature. The main problem is that you wind up with a new empty page at the start of your document.It's a basic principle of software design: if many users are confused, that doesn't mean the documentation needs to be updated, it means the design needs to be updated.Thus, I vote that since the old behavior adds no value to LibreOffice, this patch be reconsidered. Otherwise, a very clear user-oriented case for the old behavior should be made.",6,25235,2016/5/27 3:27,2016/5/28 21:12,41,ABANDONED,3,74,6,11,6,negative

On the one hand,letting old cruft lie around is not good, and lettingthe old fdb in place will also lead to an .odb thatopens a different database (with different data) dependingon which version of LibreOffice opens the file...On the other hand, you are right, risk of data loss if we screw up and the fbk is not functional.On the balance of it, I'd say ""people should make backups, remove the old fdb"". Ideally, we would make a popup that warns people about this ""silent upgrade"", too.> Anyway I don't think it will be a common happening,> because it works only with fb 3.0 fdb files,> and the update comes in the same time.This part of the code will indeed be useless as longas we bundle Firebird 3.0 because it cannot openFirebird 2.5 .fdb files.

The frames are still created on demand. Its just that in practice I see that on playback sometimes frames are skipped due to timing issues, in which case we need to occasionally ""catch up"" the missing ones. i.e. play 0, 1, 3, 4 skipping 2. so frame 3 renders 2 into the virtualdevice as well as 3 to get the right final bitmap. > If just shown, the > 1st frame will be needed, if played the whole stack will be needed > to do so (all extra actions to create on-demand here will just let > it stuck in the 1st loop). If not shown, all the stack can be > flushed.I think we're getting hung up on the first frame, the first frame gets requested occasionally during the playback of the animated gif (by the preview I think) so it seemed natural to treat that one separately by caching it so as not not affect the shared virtual devices in use by playback of the active sequence. > So I see no value in on-demand creating *single frames* of the > stack, besides that I do not see code to flush it if not used. It > will just use the same amount of mem when the GIF is shown and > played once.As the animation is played each frame is requested in sequence and each frame bitmap is generated and returned, rendered, and forgotten about, so (ignoring the first frame cache) there is only one bitmap in memory at a time. > My approch would be to create (b) the whole stack on-demand if played (not at load time)What I want to avoid though is 382 simultaneous 1920 x 1080 bitmaps.

38011,"Patch Set 1:Hi Kendy,Please look into this and tell me if it is the right way to proceed.This throws the Unknown Property Exception as indicated below.I think we may need to call this setPropertyValue() <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/editeng/source/uno/unofield.cxx#675> instead of the one currently being called <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sw/source/core/unocore/unofield.cxx#2152> which is throwing up an Unknown Property Exception at <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sw/source/core/unocore/unofield.cxx#2165> One is sw's implementation while the other is editeng's implementation. Moggi was of the opinion that the setPropertyValue() from editeng couldn't be called here. But the current one is unable to support that property (UNO_TC_PROP_TEXTFIELD_TYPE). How would it be possible to proceed?I'm influenced by this comment <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/offapi/com/sun/star/text/textfield/Type.idl#19> when I say the above.Also, I did a '#define UNO_NAME_TEXT_FIELD_TYPE ""TextFieldType""' in <opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sw/inc/unoprnms.hxx> taking other properties from here <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/include/editeng/unonames.hxx> as an example. But I'm unsure if this is the right way to proceed.Since I've mentioned '[optional, property]long TextFieldType;' as optional in <opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/offapi/com/sun/star/text/textfield/ExtendedUser.idl>, I might need a boolean to indicate when 'setPropertyValue()' must be called for each of the fields from <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/offapi/com/sun/star/text/textfield/Type.idl> in here <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/xmloff/source/text/txtfldi.cxx#706>. I don't think we need to call it for all 15 properties all the time. How do I use the boolean variable - like for example - how do I use it to indicate when to set EXTENDED_TIME and when not to..?Regarding the comment thread on the bug page - you'd asked what happens when I run it without removing certain stuff from content.xml . The exact same exceptions are thrown in the order of Comment 13 first and then Comment 14.On a side note, I would like to say that I'm doing this coz you'd asked me to work on LO code (with respect to GSoC) and this was a bug reported by you. Since you didn't remember filing this bug, if there is something else that you'd want me to work on, please do tell.I would have loved to work on creating MAR files (from onlineupdate module), and still do think that's the best thing to do as it would mean I would get a headstart when it comes to the actual coding period begin dates, and had sent a mail to you regarding that. But on not receivng a reply, I'd assumed you didn't want me to work on that. Please do indicate what you think I should be working on.Thanks :-)",1,25556,2016/4/4 14:12,2016/4/4 14:12,0,ABANDONED,5,23,4,20,1,negative

38031,"Patch Set 1:Regarding the other icons:1. it doesn't stand near other icons, it's used in FAB only, and other icons are menu only, so the difference isn't really noticeable.2. I'm reworking the icons as we speak. Mostly because they're incorrect size now (new Action Bar is taller), and they're Holo gray instead of Material white. And also because SVG versions were missing.Also, we could use optipng, but I think it's not really necessary, since we'd be saving just a couple of KB's, while potentially reducing the quality of the PNG's.",1,25567,2016/4/14 14:22,2016/4/14 14:22,0,ABANDONED,10,10,2,8,1,positive

I was a bit upset that the headless patch was merged even though the ESC asked the author not to merge it in its current form. The opengl situation on our Android port is a bit unclear. On one hand, we disable opengl in configure, OTOH it seems we build most of the opengl code in vcl. My commit just restored that status quo, fixing the build. I also verified that the build result actually works. :-)Given that at the end Android uses cairo to render the tiles, the opengl code is not useful on Android. However, probably it's a good idea to not work on removing it from the Android binary till it's not clear if those opengl #ifdefs will go away or not in the long run. (Currently we have those ifdefs, but it's possible they will be reverted, it's not clear yet.)",1,25623,2016/3/29 21:59,2016/3/29 22:36,0,ABANDONED,1,2,5,10,1,negative

38174,Patch Set 1:(1 comment)So this is going to be an ugly one.We are now hitting a limitation of the current test framework. Currently all our tests don't have access to the UI configuration as it breaks the tests. Now I don't remember why I went the way of pointing the ui path to the user profile but it still seems to be necessary. Back when I wrote that code there were however no UI files so it was still so that the whole UI should have worked. Now with the UI files this is no longer true and pointing the UI config path to a place that does not the UI files causes an exception and later a crash.I will need some time to get back into the details of the configuration management during the tests.,1,25668,2016/3/21 14:48,2016/3/21 14:48,0,ABANDONED,3,60,3,7,2,positive

38485,"Patch Set 1:I understand that we want to remove setting the MapModes, I'm just saying that I think that during the conversion process we should ensure that the actual MapMode is HMMs, so the code works in HMMs, and when we change the internal calculations to be HMMs we'll just have to remove one SetMapMode from the beginning of the drawing code.What I don't understand is where is the current MapMode changes to TWIPS from HMMs in DrawFrame. I was trying to use PixelToLogic to convert the vertices of a polygon, but it was not working, and the reason was that somehow the MapMode changes between the call site of DrawFrame and the middle of DrawRotatedFrame. That's the reason why I added it here:https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/#/c/17276/1/sc/source/ui/view/output.cxx@1666I want to remove it but I don't know how to calculate the vertices otherwise, or where the MapMode is changed.

38491,"Patch Set 1:Hi Katarina,The reason it was done that way (by me) is that the toolbar button is a split button (i.e. it can be clicked on the button *or* on the dropdown part), so it's possible to apply the last used color easily. So the toolbar button shouldn't update with the current color, but instead show the last used one.",1,25939,2015/6/5 6:56,2015/6/5 7:04,0,ABANDONED,1,43,4,10,1,negative
38492,"Patch Set 1:Well, for me this is the desired result:1. A simple button (i.e. with ToolBoxItemBits::DROPDOWNONLY bits) should show the current color of the selected text/object.2. A split button (i.e. with ToolBoxItemBits::DROPDOWN bits) should initially show some common color, and later the last used one, for easy re-applying it on another text/object.3. All buttons of the same kind (simple vs split), and that are representing the same text attribute, should be synced, and show the same color, regardless whether they are on the toolbar or on the sidebar.This means that if we have .uno:Color on both the toolbar and the sidebar, and *both* are split buttons, they need to be synced - but with the last used color, not with the current one (i.e. if you move the cursor to a text with a different color, it shouldn't affect the button). That's why SvxColorToolBoxControl::StateChanged has the check for bSidebarType, so split buttons won't be updated with the current color, but keep the last used one. This bSidebarType is simply used for distinguish between simple and split buttons, allowing them to share the same code, it's just poorly named (because most of the buttons in the sidebar are simple buttons - except the ones from the text panel, and all the toolbar buttons are split ones).Now, this scenario of syncing split buttons is not yet implemented (and already reported in tdf#82438). The problem is that the last used color is stored inside PaletteManager, and we have separate instance of it for each visible button. This causes also that the last used color resets after closing and re-opening the toolbar (because SvxColorToolboxControl instances are destroyed together with the toolbar) - see tdf#61868, tdf#71413, tdf#72991, tdf#83789.One possible solution is to turn PaletteManager into a singleton, so we'll have only one instance, and could manage all visible buttons from there. That way we could also sync the ""recent colors"" palette between all visible pickers, and maybe also the currently chosen main palette. Right now each visible button has its own instance of all these settings. Even worse - right now each instance has its own list of all palettes and their colors, thus wasting resources. Such kind of things surely should be managed in a centralized way.",1,25939,2015/6/5 6:56,2015/6/5 7:04,0,ABANDONED,1,43,4,10,1,negative

38614,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1Basically not a bad approach, but it should be done more modular, e.g. create a primitive class hich has gradient stops and decomposes to the already existing FillGradientPrimitive2D, so nothing has to change there (safe) and the new classes will extend the functionality in the sende of primitives (as intended). This would also avoid the from my POV unacceptable double definition of StartColor/EndColor.In general it can be done to extend all 'classic' gradients to gradient stops (modular), but is questionable - evtl. implementing the SVG gradient definitions and using these if needed would be superiour. This can also be done using primitives and a decomposition, so all renderers would be capable of crunching these.",1,26027,2014/11/28 9:44,2014/11/28 9:49,0,ABANDONED,3,89,3,5,1,positive

We can always use the former, but I think later approach is better and cleaner way of doing things. We can sort-of know the order when the handlers would be called. With function pointers, we can precisely control the point at which the default handlers will be emitted; we can chain up to the parent in our default handler. This is similar to as we have done in lok_doc_view_class_init function for the widget class overriding their key_press_event, key_release_event etc.See: https://developer.gnome.org/gobject/unstable/gobject-Signals.htmlWith g_signal_connect-ed handlers, we would be having no idea which one would be called first.Currently this is not a huge problem; I can always make it work with g_signal_connect in g-d, but it would be cleaner otherwise, and in the long run.Regarding the ABI, yes we can add up as many new signals as up to today, but that leaves us with only one option of connecting to signals i.e g_signal_connect.

It does fix the specific bug, but currently, there are too many problems with ScPostIt/SdrCaptionObj lifetime management that need to be addressed in a consistent fasion, so currently I'm preparing a draft specification for discussion of what changes are planned and why they are needed. That spec does describe why currently deletion of the object in real document (when, e.g. the ScPostIt was deleted by user) crashes the Undo/Redo operation (where only pointers to now-deleted object are stored). That's why I don't update this patch (it should probably be abandoned for now?).Thank you for notes/correstions, and excuse me for not explaining the silence; I should have noted that earlier.",4,26397,2015/6/9 10:10,2015/6/16 15:01,172,ABANDONED,1,9,6,10,4,negative

When reading a git log, it is useful to have a few details on the rationale behind a change: what problem are you solving, what approach youÔÇÖve followed to fix it, etc. Examples of good commit messages are in PoeditÔÇÖs repo, this is a random example: https://github.com/vslavik/poedit/commit/d6af8b16f386c92af4ad3107346990a57d92d4c5(Of course, you donÔÇÖt have to write novels out of commit messages, but most of the time a few explaining sentences are prefectly fine.)2.

39784,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1(1 comment)Hi Yogesh, thanks for looking into this.I was worried about the change to wrtw8sty.cxx so I had a bit of a look at the bug myself to understand it better.  I found two different issues which contribute:- the import from docx appears to have a bug which is at play here: when I open the docx in LibreOffice I see that the first page footer has wrong spacing. This affects the export code which tries to join chained page styles into a single word section if they match.  The import bug means that they do not match, so it will try to export this as two different word sections.- however some code recently added to ww8/ww8atr.cxx in a31fbb53dba7 prevents the output of a new section at the page break in this case, as the paragraph on the first page is empty             if( isTextNodeEmpty )                bNewPageDesc = false;So I think these are the two issues that need to be addressed, rather than the change proposed in this item.

There is no implementation of updown bars for line chart as of today(import part is almost missing), we might have to implement it the way it has been implemented for Stock Chart/Candle Stick Chart.I had checked the feasibility of reusing this code, since one or more properties were specific to Stock chart I had to add a property instead of reusing the existing ""UpDown"" property.We have logged a separate issue for handling the rest of properties for updown bars associated to line charts.

40250,"Patch Set 1: This need some tweaks before it is mergedWhile the code looks ok from a first glance (I didn't verify yet) it will not solve the problem. The IANA language tag registry does not define default scripts for languages, it only defines suppress-script for a few. For all other languages you'd still not get the script. See instdir/share/liblangtag/language-subtag-registry.xmlFurthermore, we avoid at all costs to pull in liblangtag if not necessary (hence all the internal handling of known tags in canonicalize()) because (despite that the rsc resource compiler can't use liblangtag) it needs a significant amount of time to initialize its data, which at startup would add ~10% of startup time. If VCL needed liblangtag already just to display some glyphs that would be a heavy drawback.My suggestion to solve this would be to add an extra default script field in i18nlangtag/source/isolang/isolang.cxx to aImplIsoLangEntries and aImplBcp47CountryEntries and change the lang::Locale returns of MsLangId::Conversion::*() methods to a struct of Locale and additionally a Script field. They are used only internally by LanguageTag and not part of a public API so that would be no problem. Of course doing so would need quite some changes and finding all default scripts for all known locales would be a lot of investigation work.",1,27350,2013/11/28 11:07,2013/11/28 13:08,2,ABANDONED,4,88,2,3,1,negative

40419,"Patch Set 3:> One could argue that since legacy code will generally blissfully > ignore the IsTimeZoned member, it gives better backwards > compatibility. This assumes that older OO.org/LibreOffice usually > served local time in css.util.(Date)Time, which is not obvious to me. > It seems to be the case in *some* places, but not in others, so we > need a general cleanup anyway. > OOXMLDocPropHandler::GetDateTimeFromW3CDTF is an example of a codepath > that puts UTC in a UNO DateTime.I'd regard that as an exception to the general handling, it is not only*some* places but *most* places that assume local time. > Any other reason for ""store in startup-time localtime""?Document persistence and API compatibility. But, I'd not even call that""startup-time localtime"" because calculations of offsets may always beinfluenced by the *current* local timezone and DST. I'd rather call it""wallclock time"" because Time/DateTime fields and cell values so farcontain a time not bound to any region. Setting/getting those via UNOAPI always assumed that. Reading/writing ODF assumes it. Passing an UTCtime with IsTimeZoned=true will make existing unchanged code assume theUTC time to be wallclock time instead.To me the IsTimeZoned member doesn't make much sense other than if it isset to false. The application does not know the actual offset, no matterif we define a) true==local_time_with_timezone or b)true==UTC_with_timezone, it will always use the current offsetusing/displaying different values in different timezones for b) orcalculating different UTC for a). For only this reason b) would bebetter because the actual used value would be UTC converted to currentlocal time. But then, if that is wanted, why not useDateTimeWithTimeZone and TimeZone=0 ?Btw, I'm tempted to rename the structs and members and .idl to not useTimeZone but Timezone instead. I find it a tad confusing visually to seeDateTimeWithTimeZone (a date and time with time and zone ...) and wouldprefer DateTimeWithTimezone, but maybe that's just me..

There's too many files to check by hand so a automated or at least semi-automated approach is necessary.Anyway, thanks for the comments! I hadn't thought about indirect inclusion. How about this refined approach:For each .cxx file,1) Use the brute-force approach to find candidate headers for removal, and use ""g++ -H"" to dump out a full list of all included headers 2) If a candidate header shows up *once* in the list from g++ -H, it's definitely unnecessary and we remove it. If it shows up more than once (via indirect inclusion), then we leave it alone for now.This should give a smaller list of includes to remove, or in the case of no indirect inclusions, the same list.Are there any other pitfalls that are worth looking out for?

When evaluating the options for our unit testing frameworks we also evaluated the use of python to write our tests and decide against it for several reasons including the problems while debugging the tests.I'm a bit concerned with adding a new language for testing the c++ code. We have already the java test which go through the uno java bridge and it turned out to be a real pain to maintain these tests.Personally I prefer to keep tests in the same language as the code that should be tested to make it easier to maintain them.,1,27701,2013/3/30 21:10,2013/3/30 22:07,0,ABANDONED,11,421,3,3,2,negative

40884,"Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisHi Mathias,first thanks for your patch. It is great start; Well, it does some non-standard things. I suggest to re-shufle it a bit :-)1. You already mentioned that you were unsure about    downloading the files inside configure. I suggest to   do it using the download script.   You might already see the many @FILENAME@ entries in   ooo.lst.in. They are optional. If you do not define such    variable in configure, it will be empty in the generated    ooo.lst file and it will not be downloaded.2. If you use download, it will get the files into the   $TARFILE_LOCATION instead of $SRC_ROOT/moz/zipped.      I suggest to modify the related makefiles in ""moz""    module to find the .zip archives in $TARFILE_LOCATION   Note that this approach follows the current trends.   In the past, we copied many 3rd party tarballs into   the related build subdirectories. We do not longer   do it. We already updated most makefiles to unpack the    tarballs directly from the $TARFILE_LOCATION.   3. I suggest to do not copy the dlls in configure because    it is not typical. Instead, I suggest to define variables   that will point to the files. Then you could copy the   files in the makefile that need to use the dlls.4. Please, do not remove the TABs from configure.in from    lines 4469-4515. These lines are copied into ""Makefile""    that is later tested. TABs are important in Makefiles,   so your change breaks this test.Thanks a lot for working on it. Feel free to ask if you are in doubts.",1,27953,2012/10/14 21:24,2012/10/14 21:24,0,ABANDONED,1,67,2,2,1,negative

40893,"Patch Set 1: Do not submitHmm, I am confused by all the changes:1. In the dmake fix, it does not make sense to save   the number of read items and just increment it.      Instead, it would make sense to check if it really   did read the item, for example:      if (fread( (char *)&flhdr, sizeof(flhdr), 1, f ) != 1) return (-1);   2. In the lpsolve fix, it is not a good idea to redirect all   error messages to /dev/null. It would hide real build   errors as well.      Instead, it would be better to fix the lpsolve code   to do not produce warnigns at all.3. The concat-deps.c is strange as well. It is a similar   problem like in dmake.      IMHO, we need to return an error if it does not write   the whole item => you need to modify the function   print_fullpaths to return integer instead of void.   Then you could use something like:      if (fwrite(token, token_len, 1, stdout) != 1) return EIO;      Of course, you need to handle the print_fullpaths return   value where it is called.",1,27966,2012/10/18 23:44,2012/10/18 23:44,0,ABANDONED,3,21,2,2,3,negative

1898,"Patch Set 4:> I know I am a bit late to the party, but I think if we have orthogonal variants of indexing ""levels"" then we shouldn't try to implement it as a scale (none < statistics <? notifications < both < full) and should instead treat them as flags (statistics, notifications, instances).On the indexing API, this does make a lot of sense, and it would definitely be more future-proof. However, on the implementation side (the actual base index), the concerns are not truly orthogonal (e.g. if we have 'instance' indexing, we get stats and notifications practically for free), so there are only really these 5 modes of operation. The nontrivial part of the lattice logic must be provided somewhere (e.g. if matcher backend A requests instance and notification indexing, we do nothing when backend B later requests stats). So with a bit more work, we could probably have ├übel's service flags on the IQRC API, and the indexing level enum or something equivalent in the base index itself. Is it worth it?Also, what's the nicest way to provide the 'flags'? @Data class with three boolean fields? EnumSet for a three-valued enum representing the three services?

2137,"Patch Set 7: Code-Review-1(8 comments)Thanks for your partial review, Laurent! While doing a review on my own and incorporating your review, I found a problem that when only the UML file is changed, the approach won't work too.I re-investigated this problem and thought about it a while... the nicest way would be to avoid loosing the information on the resources in scope during the minimization; that is, minimizing the scope but storing somewhere which resources had been in scope at the beginning. Then it would be very easy to check if a .di file was in the scope.Ideally, we could change that in the ComparisonScopeBuilder. However, e.g. the EMFModelProvider calls the IdenticalResourceMinimizer before the ComparisonScopeBuilder is even used to create the scope later down the road. Thus, there is no central point that we could change in order to retain the list of original resources in the scope.(On a side note, I stumbled across a potential source if problems: SynchronizationModel.getResources() is created lazily. If getResources() is called before the minimizer is applied to the SynchronizationModel, it'll contains the original set of resources also after the minimization. If it is called afterwards, it won't contain it. Sometimes getResources() it is called before the minimization step, such as in org.eclipse.emf.compare.ide.ui.internal.logical.EMFModelProvider.getOrComputeLogicalModel(IFile, ResourceMappingContext, IProgressMonitor), sometimes it isn't. So we cannot trust that the getResources() is minimal or not. I'll add a task for myself to open a separate BR on that.)So my best remaining idea so far: remove the comparison scope adapter introduced in this review again and instead introduce a postprocessor that checks if any .di file exists for the matched resources and if yes, mark the comparison as a PapyrusComparison.For marking the comparison as a Papyrus, the nicest way would be introducing a context field into the Comparison model. If we don't want to change the comparison model, we again could add an adapter to it in order to mark it. But that's not particularly clean :)What do you think about the above mentioned postprocessor approach? It is not super-efficient, as we theoretically had the information already that we obtain again in the postprocessor. But at least we only do it once for each comparison instead of checking it again and again in the different UI components.",7,2028,2016-03-02 14:57:27,2016-04-27 16:22:49,1345,MERGED,36.0,3498.0,4,7,28,positive,"Patch Set 7: Code-Review-1(8 comments)Thanks for your partial review, Laurent!

Before that, please have a look at the following as well:- It is not working for type names, e.g. when you type a substring of a class name to declare a field.- The relevance / proposal order is mixed up when fields are proposed with types. Example:public class C {	int intField;	String stringField;	{		field|	}}- In case of methods, the substring is also matched in its parameters, return type, declaring type etc. I think it should be restricted to only the method name.- Filtering of the results still seems to have some issue. Not sure if the filtered results look confusing or non-relevant due to the above issue of not restricting the match to just the name or if it is due to the non-subsequent matching.

12083,"Patch Set 8:Hi Stefan. I don't think the analogy with the Java editor holds up. If you create a ""New > Class"", then as soon as the dialog is closed and before the editor opens, the file already exists on disk. This is *not* the case with snippets. If I use ""Add"" or ""Create Snippet"", then the editor just opened is for a snippet that does not yet exist on disk. It *only* exists in memory. In fact, the snippet editor does not even know where on disk the snippet will be saved and in what format. This is all handled by the snippet repository (in SnippetEditor.doSave):  repo.importSnippet(snippet);What importSnippet does (e.g., creating a .json file, doing a HTTP POST to a remote server, whatever) is hidden from the editor. The editor sees only the in memory snippet. See SnippetEditorInput.oldSnippet and SnippetEditorInput.snippet. The old snippet is immutable; the new snippet may overwrite this or save it under a new UUID instead.I hope this clarifies some things.",8,8960,2014-06-12 19:10:02,2014-08-13 08:54:17,1477,MERGED,20.0,743.0,3,14,18,positive,"Patch Set 8:Hi Stefan.

But nice thing about not keeping it in alpha order that currently selected element is always first, and previous is always second, which is nice if you switching between two. Otherwise it would be more confusing3. LC run not from toolbar - I don't think we need to keep them (and it would be hard to do also, model does have backward mapping)4. Persistence - its a good idea (maybe not in this patch though)"

For example, if I have the OSResources view open when using a post-mortem session (core file), GDB gives:   448,664 [MI]  24-info-os   448,666 [MI]  24^error,msg=""Can not fetch data now.""   or   600,684 [MI]  25-info-os modules   600,686 [MI]  25^error,msg=""Can not fetch data now.""But the view is stuck showing ""Determining available OS resource classes..."" or ""Fetching data..."" depending on the timing.10- One time I got the following reply from GDB (maybe my gdbserver was wrong), but it caused an NPE that I think we should guard against:   915,516 [MI]  42-info-os semaphores   921,522 [MI]  ~""Ignoring packet error, continuing...\n""   921,523 [MI]  42^error,msg=""Can not fetch data now.""Exception in thread ""MI RX Thread"" java.lang.NullPointerException    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.output.MIInfoOsInfo.get(MIInfoOsInfo.java:173)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.output.MIInfoOsInfo.parseResourcesInformation(MIInfoOsInfo.java:128)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.output.MIInfoOsInfo.<init>(MIInfoOsInfo.java:75)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.commands.MIInfoOs.getResult(MIInfoOs.java:47)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.commands.MIInfoOs.getResult(MIInfoOs.java:1)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.AbstractMIControl$RxThread.processMIOutput(AbstractMIControl.java:907)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.AbstractMIControl$RxThread.run(AbstractMIControl.java:754)11- The new osresources.gif icon should go under the view16 folder and should be renamed to osresources_view.gif,    i.e., dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/icons/full/view16/osresources_view.gif    Don't forget to update the plugin.xml file to match12- In MANIFEST.MF, please export the new osview package, as the other packages are exported"

14446,"Patch Set 2:Alexander, I'm not that familiar with GTK to answer if it's possible to create a button without having to create compound container (as it's asked in #415230).

14989,"Patch Set 2:> This is by design. Merely changing null.unboxInt() to return 0 instead of -1 will break MANY things only in the state system (like stack attributes, off the top of my head). And that's without talking about views.There's a few things broken as it is now:- You can't get a -1 Int value from the factory method but you can get one using incrementAttribute() on a -2 Int value- Calling incrementAttribute() on this -1 Int value skips 0 and goes to 1.- The State System Explorer view cannot display a factory-made -1 Int value (as it is nullValue), it shows a blank value.If there is any code that is using the unboxed value of nullValue to check for null, that is badly designed code because it cannot differentiate with a real Int of that same value, it should use isNull(). I believe it's better to bite the bullet and correct that code now. Hopefully all of it is fixed by the patch now.Mathematically, I think it makes more sense to use zero as the null value's numerical value.> This is also by design. If we start to allow unboxing from one type to another, people might stop caring about what the actual type is, and always unbox their things into longs for example, doing costly casts over and over.It's a point to consider, but I prefer to give the benefit of the doubt and the flexibility to the designers. In the code I'm doing now, I have to do floating point mathematical operations on a list of state values that can be a mix of Int, Long, Double or nullValue. Using unboxDouble() gives much cleaner code than having a if-else or switch statement on the value Type to figure out the correct unboxing method.The unit tests should be correct now. The LTTng kernel state system creates a Threads/-1 attribute because the first events arrive before the Current_thread attribute has any value set. I considered updating the expected test state system with these events using the Threads/0 attribute (due to the current thread nullValue's int value), but decided against it because it would still be incorrect to consider that these events occurred in the swapper (0) thread.

This will make up the apt.jar.At that point I would also rename 'srcext' to 'src-ext' and binext to src-ext.Hints:- you also need to set/change the output folders.- /bin must be changed in createAndAddAnnotationJar- getPluginClassesDir must return bin-annotations==> ideally, there should be a constant for bin-int, so that one has not to change it in two places in the future- adjust build.properties and manifest.mf- run TestsAll to verify that it works in the workspaceI know this is a bigger change, but it will make it easier for future contributors to understand this setup.The addition of '.gitignore' is unrelated and should be in a separate file (if really needed)."

15209,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1(15 comments)Hi XavierVery nice addition! Our user will want that.Beside the inline commends I have two requests below.

Why not in this case?  Or are we free now to introduce more POM hierarchy for other purposes?  That would be fine with me; I just thought that was not currently policy.  Also, I'm concerned that we're adding POM files that aren't maintained within the Eclipse projects and are therefore not easily managed within the Eclipse environment (they are only accessible in the Git directories).  For example, there isn't a plugins/infra/gmfdiag/css/xtext/.project file to create an Eclipse project that makes the pom.xml accessible within Eclipse.Any comment on the site.xml and xdoc files that look like auto-generated stubs?  AFAIK, we don't use these in Papyrus.

Why not in this case?  Or are we free now to introduce more POM hierarchy for other purposes?  That would be fine with me; I just thought that was not currently policy.  Also, I'm concerned that we're adding POM files that aren't maintained within the Eclipse projects and are therefore not easily managed within the Eclipse environment (they are only accessible in the Git directories).  For example, there isn't a plugins/infra/gmfdiag/css/xtext/.project file to create an Eclipse project that makes the pom.xml accessible within Eclipse.Any comment on the site.xml and xdoc files that look like auto-generated stubs?

22562,"Patch Set 1:Hi J Langley,First, thanks for the contribution!   Your patch looks excellent.  I think we should easily be able to get this incorporated into ECF 3.9.1.A few very minor comments:1) For the ScpBrowseFileTransferFactory class:  Is there any need to have this class be in a new (and exported) package org.eclipse.ecf.provider.filetransfer.scp?  Unless you already know that this class is going to be accessed by some other bundle, I would prefer that it be placed in the existing internal package:  org.eclipse.ecf.internal.provider.scp.  That way, the scp provider code would all be exposed by internal-only packages...and this browse edition would be consistent with the retrieve and send classes (which are in the internal package now).2) If you move the ScpBrowseFileTransferFactory class into the internal package, it would make it unnecessary to export a new package in the manifest.mf.  For maintenance, it would be nice for us to continue to not export any non-internal packages.I can make the following changes if you wish...just wanted to include them in public review:3) The Bundle-Version in the manifest should be updated from 2.0.100.qualifier to 2.1.0.qualifier (minor revision because of new functionality).4) In org.eclipse.ecf.internal.provider.filetransfer.scp.ScpFileSystemBrowser there are a couple of commented lines:		// FIXME - This code is from ScpOutgoingFileTransfer, but it throws		// exceptions		// if (scpUtil != null) {		// scpUtil.sendZeroToStream(outputStream);		// scpUtil.checkAck(inputStream);		// }Probably best just to remove these lines...unless they are needed for the browse.But overall things look great.  I will fix 3 and 4 prior to commit if you prefer.

22624,"Patch Set 1:A further change in how Model Explorer manages refresh, to avoid recalculating the entire tree structure on every model edit, which doesn't scale well on large models.First, the Model Explorer's resource-set listener now only schedules structural refreshes for the specific objects that notified changes.Second, the UMLLabelProvider fires LabelProviderChangedEvents to trigger label updates for elements that derive their labels from other related elements, when those related elements are changed.  This required a new mix-in interface for label providers in the Label Provider Service to allow Model Explorer and other clients to pass notifications to them on changes in the model.  I'm not entirely happy with this solution, but it does address a couple of issues with the approach I would rather have taken, which is having individual label providers listen for model changes themselves:  * the providers registered with the Label Provider Service aren't initialized with a    ResourceSet, ServicesRegistry, or other context in which they can find the    model to listen to  * providers could discover, as they are asked to provide labels, the objects they    need to listen to.

For example, our Gerrit master JVM heap is set to 58GB, the old generation space(Tenured Generation) is 44GB which leaves 14GB for the eden and survivor spaces. The old generation space eventually becomes full (mostly by the caches including the unbound RepositoryCache) and then the application starts slowing down because GC keeps kicking in. The SoftReference are still not being collected at that point because the buffer of available memory is not bellow the threshold that would make GC consider the SoftReference.All this to say that I will do more testing on our production server but if it turns out that the performance impact is too big, I(we) will need to consider reimplementing the RepositoryCache to achieve the goal of keeping repository in memory but without being forever (I am not sure yet what would be the eviction criteria).",4,3100,2015-09-04 19:32:28,2015-09-18 19:27:35,335,MERGED,3.0,30.0,3,7,6,negative,"Patch Set 4:> Wow - this was really close.

Compare editor remains open. cgit reports the broken link suddenly as untracked.5. Do a ""Reset Hard"" on the parent commit. Now the valid link does not re-appear in package explorer. Even worse, it's gone on disk! cgit git status reports it as a staged deletion, and so does EGit's staging view. If I do the hard reset instead using cgit, the link is restored fine. Looks like EGit/JGit cannot restore a valid link if the workspace contains a broken link in that place.Other case:0: Start off with a valid top-level valid link (top-level is not in workspace) pointing to a file inside a project.1.

9205,"Patch Set 1:Sorry, I was on easter vacation and couldn't respond early enough.Could we please revert this change?  It dramatically reduces theperformance in case of non-bare repositories. Hey Shawn, what'sup? I have not seen such a small change with such a bad performanceimpact passing your review eyes :-)Semantically I think this change is correct. We want to avoiddealing with pathes where there are no diffs. How to achieve that?You could either apply a ANY_DIFF filter to the treewalk or comparethe tree entries manually when walking over the unfiltered trees.Previously ResolveMerger was manually comparing TreeEntriesand skipped over those where there are no diffs. Now you added the ANY_DIFF filter.ANY_DIFF sounds logical but performance wise it's not soo good.Its a very generic filter which compares content-IDs of all participatingTreeIterators. It doesn't differentiate between the differentiterators and blindly computes id's for the content unless it findsdifferent ids. If the treewalk happens to have a FileSystem basedWorkingTreeIterator included this means that you will have to readnearly every single File in the working tree and compute it's content SHA1to do the merge. ANY_DIFF has no idea that there may be a DirCacheIteratoralso in the TreeWalk which already contains the SHA1 of the non-dirtyworkingtree files. ANY_DIFF will always compute the SHA1 again. Onlyexception: if ANY_DIFF detects already a difference between e.g.OURS and THEIRS then it knows early that there is a diff and canskip calculating SHA1's for filesystem content.If we manually do the detection of diffs in an unfiltered treewalkwe can be much faster. Look at ResolveMerger.processEntry() to lookat all the cheap shortcuts we can use. E.g. if the index is dirty(somebody added something for that path) we can let the merge fail becauseof that.If OURS, THEIRS, BASE don't contain anything for that path we knowit's only index and working tree which may contain something for thefile - no need to process this path during the merge. If OURSis equal to BASE then the merge result is clear: It must be in THEIRS.All these are decisions we can take and completely ignoring whatsin the expensive working tree.Long talk - but here comes real world performance measurements showinghow this change compares performance wise to it's predecessor commit.

It's not easy to depend on it. * Out of the box the new content provider should not be selected. Only when toggling via menu or by the user, it should get (de-) selected accordingly.* The toggle action should also toggle the content provider, otherwise there will be strange things in the UI when the user (accidentally) disables the content provider.I would hard-wire the action and the content provider, i.e. if the user disables the content provider I would toggle the action to 'Flat'.** -> I like those 3 proposals. However, I don't know I could implement a good RadioState based on content provider activation. Do you have an example of how to do this? Or will I have to use programatic menu contributions to deal with selection? * Same applies to the filters. Here I'd even vote to not surface them in the UI, and do the filtering directly in the content provider. Otherwise, you also have to enable/disable them when toggling the menu.** -> What do you mean by ""filtering directly in the content provider"". I don't think CNF content provider provide a good way to do that. Do you have an example? * The content provider does not react to changes: 'Import as Project' does not let the new project appear, and deleting a nested project does not bring it back as folder. I have to press 'F5' to get the view refreshed.** -> That's indeed an issue. This feature should place a few more workspace/resource listeners to trigger refresh on project creation/deletion. There are already some for some cases, I'll have a look at the reported scenario. * The state of nesting should be stored as dialog setting and not as preference. Maybe this can even be computed by the enabled state of the content provider.** -> ok for persisting it as dialog settings.

It's not easy to depend on it. * Out of the box the new content provider should not be selected. Only when toggling via menu or by the user, it should get (de-) selected accordingly.* The toggle action should also toggle the content provider, otherwise there will be strange things in the UI when the user (accidentally) disables the content provider.I would hard-wire the action and the content provider, i.e. if the user disables the content provider I would toggle the action to 'Flat'.** -> I like those 3 proposals. However, I don't know I could implement a good RadioState based on content provider activation. Do you have an example of how to do this? Or will I have to use programatic menu contributions to deal with selection? * Same applies to the filters. Here I'd even vote to not surface them in the UI, and do the filtering directly in the content provider. Otherwise, you also have to enable/disable them when toggling the menu.** -> What do you mean by ""filtering directly in the content provider"". I don't think CNF content provider provide a good way to do that. Do you have an example? * The content provider does not react to changes: 'Import as Project' does not let the new project appear, and deleting a nested project does not bring it back as folder. I have to press 'F5' to get the view refreshed.** -> That's indeed an issue. This feature should place a few more workspace/resource listeners to trigger refresh on project creation/deletion. There are already some for some cases, I'll have a look at the reported scenario. * The state of nesting should be stored as dialog setting and not as preference. Maybe this can even be computed by the enabled state of the content provider.** -> ok for persisting it as dialog settings. However, I'd like to keep the preference as a default activation of nested view of projects, so RCP apps could enable this by default from the plugin_customization.ini. Other TODOs:* The content provider does not have an icon."

10653,"Patch Set 8:> I'm not sure why you're moving the information about disabled actionSets from the actionSets into the page hidden.  It is not moving but adding the persistence layer.> Is it just the regular mechanism is disconnected? I didn't get it, sorry.> For any given window, the perspective worked with the ActionSetManager to turn on or off actionSets (it seems to do it via the IContextService). It doesn't matter what the defaults were when the perspective was created, only that the perspective remember what actionSets are active at the moment.This is still true, but ActionSetManager (and also no one else) never persisted the ""disabled"" action sets as user choice. So you could request to show/hide them (depending on the application needs), but once user decides to get rid of some action set, this decision must ""override"" application choice. The best example is the debug action sett with the global debug buttons. In the old implementation you could try to ""hide"" them - but on next restart they will come back again, or, even worse, as soon as you hit a breakpoint - and this mean they will be back in a minute.

This is important because the FilteringPaletteProvider is part of the public API (per Papyrus policy of having all publicly exposed component as part of the public API). This could induce false expectations from the user, especially if a custom user-defined provider does not support the way it is proxied.Indeed, the FilteringPaletteProvider have a peculiar way of using the proxied palette provider by resetting its contributions repeatedly (on line 260). This works for the DefaultPaletteProvider because we know the inner workings of this class, but this is not guaranteed to work on all IPaletteProvider.

This is important because the FilteringPaletteProvider is part of the public API (per Papyrus policy of having all publicly exposed component as part of the public API). This could induce false expectations from the user, especially if a custom user-defined provider does not support the way it is proxied.Indeed, the FilteringPaletteProvider have a peculiar way of using the proxied palette provider by resetting its contributions repeatedly (on line 260). This works for the DefaultPaletteProvider because we know the inner workings of this class, but this is not guaranteed to work on all IPaletteProvider.

Essentially, two XWTTabDescriptors are equal (and therefore would generate the same SWT controls) if their IDs are equal and their ordered lists of section descriptors are equal.With this change, the continuity of the property sheet UI is a bit better for the user:  when changing the selection, if the new selection presents the same tab with the same widgets as the currently active tab, then that tab just shows the newly selected element.  So, for example, once the user activates the Profile tab of an element to work with applied stereotypes, that tab seamlessly updates when selecting another shape in the diagram or another element in the Model Explorer (even going back-and-forth between diagram and explorer, where selections are GEF EditParts in the one case and facet tree-elements wrapping semantic model elements in the other).

13382,"Patch Set 6: Code-Review+1OK.  So, I determined that the problem with Patch Set #5 was interaction between UML2 and CDO.  The root cause was that computing cross-references ""intrinsically"" using eCrossReferences() triggered the CacheAdapter in a UML Property element, which uses the inverse cross-referencing capability to compute NamedElement::clientDependency (which used to be persistent in UML 2.4 but now isn't in UML 2.5).  This also triggered loading of objects from the CDO repository.The end result was that a Diagram in a *.notation resource, still only partially loaded from the repository (it didn't have its contained objects, yet) had the CacheAdapter attached and the CacheAdapter didn't find any contents or cross-references because the Diagram hadn't finished loading.  Later, when the Diagram's CDOLegacyAdapter got around to finishing loading, the CacheAdapter was unaware of new contained objects (Shapes in the persistedChildren containment reference) being added, because they are added without notifications (the assumption being that nothing needs to be notified because the object doesn't properly exist, yet; a reasonable assumption under normal circumstances).  Therefore, the CacheAdapter is never propagated to the rest of the contents of the diagram, so any code that needs to find diagram views of UML model elements doesn't find them, and Papyrus on CDO is basically broken.Patch Set #6 fixes this problem by reverting to the original design of the ECrossReferenceAdapter's getCrossReferences() method, which computes the cross-references ""extrinsically"".  To fix the memory leak (this bug) I override useIsSet() in the feature-iterator to basically re-implement the special case of eCrossReferences() from ENamedElementImpl.  It's unfortunate that this hard-codes an Ecore special case, but I don't have a better fix that doesn't break some already established clients.

13585,"Patch Set 4:Thanks for giving this a look-over Daniel.  I introduced a new interface for a few reasons.First, I didn't want to filter getChildNodes() directly so as to maintain the original DOM.  The interface instead allows navigators of the DOM, such as the CSSEngine, to decide to use visibility as a shortcut.  This is useful for the CSS Spy.Second, a developer should be able to query the CSSEngine for the computed styles of an invisible widget.  I'm not sure that it's explicitly stated, but it would seem to be a reasonable expectation that if P = parent of C, then C should be a child of P.Third, I thought it might be a better pattern than cause CSSStylableElement to implement a getVisibleChildNodes(), and implement a default in ElementAdapter.  We may well have other document models that don't have a concept of visibility.I initially tried implementing this as providing an isVisible(child) method to act as a filter, but abandoned it as implementing isVisible() is particularly complicated on CTabFolder.  A CTF's children includes internal Composites and ToolBars that we can't reach programmatically, and so we can't determine their purpose.  Some of the composites exist to hold the CTabItem contents, but we can't tell which CTI.  So CTabFolderElement#getVisibleChildNodes() returns the CTabItem's control instead (perhaps it should walk and add the parents until it reaches the CTF too).

This change may break backwards compatibility in case the ActiveCellEditorRegistry was used outside NatTable to perform modifications inside.

ScrollBarHandlerTemplateAlthough I'm not quite sure how to solve it better, I don't like the solution so far. The first thing is the instanceof check that seems to be not necessary.

14803,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2A couple of questions and comments.1) With the IServiceInfoFactory registration via DS...means that DS is required by remote service admin.   (serviceInfoFactory.xml).  Is that right?   I don't have any fundamental objections...but it does mean more/new requirement for ECF RSA.2) In AbstractTopologyManager there's member variable:┬╗	private final IServiceInfoFactory serviceInfoFactory = new ServiceInfoFactory();	This instance binding is probably undesirable...i.e. should probably use either DS or ServiceTracker so that alternative IServiceInfoFactory implementers could be used.  What I was doing previously was setting the priority of ServiceInfoFactory registration to lowest possible...Integer.MIN_INTEGER or something...so that any other IServiceInfoFactory registration would take priority.3) In the previous code (for accessing the IEndpointDescriptionAdvertiser service) there's doPriveleged block...i.e.	IEndpointDescriptionAdvertiser advertiser = AccessController		             .doPrivileged(new PrivilegedAction<IEndpointDescriptionAdvertiser>() {		This was put in place because of need to run under security manager for CT tests.

18880,"Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisI found a bug and fixed it, but I have to do some double-checks with native git before we can accept this bug.That's the problem: During merge we update the index and populate the worktree for some paths. Problem is: it's a long running operation and we want to be able to recover from a failed operation without leaving a corrupted repo/work-tree. E.g. what happens if we have succesfully updated (overwritten) 10000 files but when writing file 10001 this fails and we want to rollback. Therefore we prepare the new index first and if the index was succesfully persisted then we start modifying the work-tree (what we should write in the work-tree can be seen from the new index). Means: we first call indexBuilder.commit() and then we call checkout(). That's wrong because the checkout() provides us with information which have to go into the index. Especially we don't know lastModified and length of a file until we have written it to disk. For lastmodified that's clear. But think about how autocrlf influences length.

20298,"Patch Set 6: (5 inline comments)FWIW, I'm still not done speeding up PatienceDiff.  I think we can do even better than we are doing right now.  Some of the ideas may even be leveraged back into MyersDiff.  I just haven't thought about doing that yet because its still a big ugly black box to me.Coming up with D=793 on PatienceDiff when MyersDiff comes up with D=4210 is because we are only looking at unique common lines.  When PatienceDiff cannot find a unique line in a region, it just bails and does a giant replace, while MyersDiff continues to look for context.If we plugged in MyersDiff at this point as a fallback, we should get D=4210 again.  But I'm not sure that is the best immediate fallback strategy.  We could instead build a histogram of the common lines and pick the least duplicated common lines and try to find the LCS around those.  By using least duplicated we should still avoid nasty cases like ""\t}\n"" as being an anchor point for the matching, but would still be able to break out of the degenerate case.Thus far I have done only very limited testing of PatienceDiff on real-world input.  I did wire it into DiffFormatter and run `jgit log -p` to scan through the diffs.  I didn't see any obvious variations from MyersDiff, but I don't think recent JGit history is a poster child for where patience diff is supposed to produce more readable results.In case you didn't know, my motivation behind PatienceDiff was to find another solution to Gerrit issue 487 [1], infinite loop in MyersDiff.

21719,"Patch Set 2:The plot thickens a bit. Looking further at the code, it appears that what was actually happening was that the false positive was masking a failure to request an update for when reviewer changes occurred. As w/ dependencies, it seems that adding a reviewer may not actually case the modification date to be updated. So I think that isModelUpdated will need to be modified to test that the number of current reviewers matches the number of expected reviewers.At some point this becomes a bit of a performance question, because by the time we make all of the API calls to determine whether an update should occur, we may have made enough calls to actually just go ahead and update the review! So we end up making a number of calls twice. Instead we might look at always returning true here, and checking for deltas in updateModel and returning false if there aren't any. (Right now we just assume that if updateModel is called, that updates have in fact occurred.)

22134,"Patch Set 1:This is a new Gerrit review presenting a variation of change 38587 that fixes the problem of every regeneration of the tests producing code in a new random order, which I discussed on the Papyrus-Dev mailing list. This is accomplished primarily by a verbatim translation of the QVTo transformation steps to Xtend language.  The overall design of the transformation pipeline is the same as before:  in particular, the UML models are the same.  It's just the language in which the transformations are specified that has been changed.Xtend exposes list values in UML models in their native EList terms, which affords stable and predictable ordering of transformation operations and, hence, test model structure and generated code.  It also provides for more concise, debuggable, searchable, and performant transformations with better Java integration.  On the subject of performance:  a comparison of the QVTo version against the equivalent Xtend version, averaged over 5 runs after a couple of warm-ups with the longest run discarded finds that the Xtend version runs more than twice as fast:  49.75 seconds as compared to 117.25 seconds.  This is including the M2T code-generation step that is the same Xtend in both cases and XMI identifier generation which is unique to the Xtend implementation of the UML transformations.  But, to me this is a bonus, not the important factor:  it's the tooling support and stability of the transformation that are most significant.A new UMLWriter workflow component is employed to assign predictable, stable XMI identifiers to elements of generated UML models to avoid unnecessary diffs in source control when re-generating.  (somewhat moot now that the models are no longer in git)This patch set also regenerates the test code from the Xtend version of the framework. I have git-ignored the generated UTP source models because they reference and depend on UML instance models of the GMFGens that are already git-ignored, so there's no point in having these in git.  Besides that they are now much larger because of the generated unique XMI IDs.I welcome any feed-back you may have on the question of whether we should adopt this Xtend-based transformation or continue with the QVTo implementation.

This makes it very difficult to review the change.Can we take this a step at a time, starting by just factoring out the specific releng changes needed for integration of MWE2 and Xtend into the build for this plug-in?  Also, I thought the purpose overall was to provide some shared POM that would make it easy to integrate MWE2 and Xtend into any plug-in.  Quite possibly I'm missing some context for this review that would make it more clear to me what the intent is."

And doesn't that complicate the whole thing uselessly? Is it just to cache to full range data because we suppose it may be used more than once, while each zoom range is pretty much unique?There are two reasons for the two lists. One is that when you zoom out completely (a common case) the list is already available. The other is that when you scroll and zoom out you have 'some' level of detail before you settle on a new window range and the new zoomed list is computed. Otherwise everything outside of the old window range would be completely blank, and you would be scrolling 'in the dark' (e.g. when you drag the scroll bar thumb).I can see two cases where you only need one list.

I don't mind if we add a setter now.> 2- Why do we have a set of zoomed events and another one for the full range? Isn't the full range just a special case of the zoomed events? And doesn't that complicate the whole thing uselessly? Is it just to cache to full range data because we suppose it may be used more than once, while each zoom range is pretty much unique?There are two reasons for the two lists. One is that when you zoom out completely (a common case) the list is already available. The other is that when you scroll and zoom out you have 'some' level of detail before you settle on a new window range and the new zoomed list is computed. Otherwise everything outside of the old window range would be completely blank, and you would be scrolling 'in the dark' (e.g. when you drag the scroll bar thumb).I can see two cases where you only need one list.

But (as usual, sigh) UserMenu.js isn't supposed to know about specific page URLs since they're contributed dynamically through plugins.So I guess we have to designate a special orion.page.link extension as giving the URL of the index page, add the extension to pageLinksPlugin.js, then lookup that extension from UserMenu.js to obtain the index page URL.Anyone have a better idea? :-|"

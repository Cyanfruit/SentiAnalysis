When an ScAttrArray object is constructed, by default it is set empty that is,  pData <- nullptr and nCount <- 0which is indicative of the default format. If default formatting is stored inScTable instance, for a new document if user adds new content for say first N columnswithout any formatting, then the first N ScColumn instances of ScAttrArray will getcreated by copying the default formatting from the ScTable instance. This can be avoidedby making ScTable's ScAttrArray instance be empty by default indicating default formatting.But the penalty is we have to add special cases everywhere for ScAttrArray methods. But I am not sure if we want this. Should we revert to ScTable instance storing the def.formatting ? - it would make the code simpler.",3,278,2016/4/15 16:13,2016/8/5 7:31,2679,MERGED,12,578,5,18,5,negative

Just to clarify regarding the nCol != -1 check, we need to let methods like Reset(), SetPatternArea(), ApplyStyleArea() to be called for the aNextColAttrArray but *without* changing any document content. An alternative to nCol != -1 checks is that we can have a default parameter or data member called bUnallocated with default value = false for all such methods and use that instead of (nCol != -1) when calling from aNextColAttrArray.

There is a TON of code that could be removed if one really wants to strip all of this ""require a border"" code.

This effectively changesALLOW_PADDING_WITHOUT_BORDERS into a preventative compatibility settinginstead of an enabling one.If an AllowPaddingWithoutBorders=false case is ever found, additional codewill be needed to send the SID_ALLOW_PADDING_WITHOUT_BORDERS setting foreach type of border (page, paragraph, image etc).

I, or may be > someone else, might pass actual Media Path there.Come on, you can do it ;-) it is trivial by now, when you got this farImplement a new method of MediaControl class, e.g. implUpdateURLField (it could take OUString as an argument). It should do mpMediaPath->SetText($some_url), where $some_url you're going to obtain from maItem (avmedia::MediaItem) member variable, by simply calling its getURL() method.

2385,"Patch Set 2:I'm unable to get the resize function to work. Other mentioned things can be quite easily implemented. The problem is that the media URL is not set the time when we setText() mpMediaPath to ""Insert Media Path Here"". Although media URL is set by the time setState() is called, but I'm only able to update the text of mpMediaPath from there but not the width, which results in cutoff text/overlapping elements. I had implemented this taking into consideration, the example of <TextEdit>mpTimeEdit, which seemed similar in function that it displayed some text. But, it never needs to change it's width, when set once. Not so with mpMediaPath. If there is any example of a <TextEdit>/<FixedText> that updates it's width during runtime, I might be able to do this in a similar way.",2,2169,2016/8/20 10:02,2016/8/22 4:31,42,MERGED,3,34,3,8,4,negative

Upload some real samples that generated by other software, Word for example, and describe the expected and observed result.

16388,"Patch Set 11:Hi,First, thanks for improving the cell border export code, much appreciated.When submitting or reviewing patches that touch OOXML or ODF code, please build with --with-export-validation, otherwise it's easy to overlook validation problems introduced by a patch.With that option, it is required that every PPTX document that's created by a testcase is valid OOXML. This is currently the state, it would be wonderful to keep it like that. :-)I've now fixed the problem this patch exposed (see commit 6a71fc9e48654d80f9545f43066ca56103d0cf65), but it would be even better to catch those issues before the patch hits master.Thanks a lot, and for submitting/reviewing patches,Miklos",11,13362,2015/4/16 13:54,2015/5/9 19:55,558,MERGED,5,133,1,1,11,negative

18459,"Patch Set 1:In the previous code, the zoom scale factor was ONLY saved when the zoom type was percent mode, not page width, full page etc.  I kept that logic intact - as it seems more correct logically.However, Microsoft Office ALWAYS saves the zoom scale factor.  So it could also be correct to do it that way.  That would at least help out any implementations (like LO before this patch) that import zoom percent but not zoom type.In the end, zoom type takes precedence over zoom factor, so I don't think it is important which way we choose, especially since very few people seemed interested in the bug (i.e. no bibisect).",1,15030,2015/1/2 4:33,2015/1/2 4:36,0,MERGED,1,16,3,8,2,negative

There doesn't seem to be a reason for this, as you hold the device in your hand to make use of it as a remote, so it is close to your eyes.And the 12sp is actaully rendering the text smaller than default (at least in the preview in eclipse) - sure about that?

Adding a check for a condition without knowing whether the condition can actually ever not hold is a slippery slope down ""defensive programming"" that leads to unmaintainable code.  (""What /are/ the invariants of that code?"" people will start to ask, seeing a mixture of redundant and non-redundant checks.)Given that the original code did not check for validity of accessing index 0, that could either mean that it was sloppy and ""cleverly"" relied on the fact that both String and OUString are null-terminated, so accessing index 0 is always valid technically (and the check for '*' guaranteed to fail for the empty string), or that there's an invariant enforcing aField to be non-empty anyway.Only in the first case would patch set 2 be an improvement.

36434,Patch Set 1:The reason why this change is a good thing is that being able to define conditional formats without ranges and later storing them in ScConditionalFormatList may result in crashes.Calc core always assumes non-empty conditional format ranges because they have to be kept in sync with the cell attribute storage. Inside ScConditionalFormatList::UpdateReference we will additionally delete ScConditionalFormat instances with an empty range. I also added a check to xmlcondformat.cxx that removes all conditional formats that are imported without a range to prevent a crash.The idea is to add for 4.1 an error dialog that makes clear that you either have to define a range or use Cancel. This is however not possible in 4-0 because of the string-freeze.,1,24550,2013/1/18 14:07,2013/1/20 10:24,44,MERGED,3,27,2,3,2,negative

37551,"Patch Set 6: Code-Review+1I have to *strongly* disagree. LibreOffice is unique in its definition of ""offset"" - anyone coming from Microsoft Word or another program is going to expect the behavior I outlined. The old behavior lends no benefit to the user whatsoever, whereas the new behavior does.Also, the ""current"" way of ""starting on a custom page"" is extremely difficult for many users to understand and implement, and is somewhat unreliable in its nature. The main problem is that you wind up with a new empty page at the start of your document.It's a basic principle of software design: if many users are confused, that doesn't mean the documentation needs to be updated, it means the design needs to be updated.Thus, I vote that since the old behavior adds no value to LibreOffice, this patch be reconsidered. Otherwise, a very clear user-oriented case for the old behavior should be made.",6,25235,2016/5/27 3:27,2016/5/28 21:12,41,ABANDONED,3,74,6,11,6,negative

37586,"Patch Set 7:> Saving an opened file:> When the user saves the file, there is a .fbk file> stored in the odb.

On the one hand,letting old cruft lie around is not good, and lettingthe old fdb in place will also lead to an .odb thatopens a different database (with different data) dependingon which version of LibreOffice opens the file...On the other hand, you are right, risk of data loss if we screw up and the fbk is not functional.On the balance of it, I'd say ""people should make backups, remove the old fdb"". Ideally, we would make a popup that warns people about this ""silent upgrade"", too.> Anyway I don't think it will be a common happening,> because it works only with fb 3.0 fdb files,> and the update comes in the same time.This part of the code will indeed be useless as longas we bundle Firebird 3.0 because it cannot openFirebird 2.5 .fdb files. However, since the FB devs planthat a future 3.x release will be able to open Firebird 2.5.fdb files, my plan was to already have the right logic (code)in place in LibreOffice so that (hopefully soon), when weupgrade our bundled Firebird, it will just fall in place :)",7,25263,2016/6/11 17:01,2016/6/23 17:26,288,ABANDONED,6,375,3,5,10,negative

37810,"Patch Set 3:> Caolan, honestly, I do not think this is the right way to go...This is essentially the same thing as the earlier prototype which seemed acceptable. The frames are still created on demand. Its just that in practice I see that on playback sometimes frames are skipped due to timing issues, in which case we need to occasionally ""catch up"" the missing ones. i.e. play 0, 1, 3, 4 skipping 2. so frame 3 renders 2 into the virtualdevice as well as 3 to get the right final bitmap. > If just shown, the > 1st frame will be needed, if played the whole stack will be needed > to do so (all extra actions to create on-demand here will just let > it stuck in the 1st loop). If not shown, all the stack can be > flushed.I think we're getting hung up on the first frame, the first frame gets requested occasionally during the playback of the animated gif (by the preview I think) so it seemed natural to treat that one separately by caching it so as not not affect the shared virtual devices in use by playback of the active sequence. > So I see no value in on-demand creating *single frames* of the > stack, besides that I do not see code to flush it if not used. It > will just use the same amount of mem when the GIF is shown and > played once.As the animation is played each frame is requested in sequence and each frame bitmap is generated and returned, rendered, and forgotten about, so (ignoring the first frame cache) there is only one bitmap in memory at a time. > My approch would be to create (b) the whole stack on-demand if played (not at load time)What I want to avoid though is 382 simultaneous 1920 x 1080 bitmaps.

38011,"Patch Set 1:Hi Kendy,Please look into this and tell me if it is the right way to proceed.This throws the Unknown Property Exception as indicated below.I think we may need to call this setPropertyValue() <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/editeng/source/uno/unofield.cxx#675> instead of the one currently being called <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sw/source/core/unocore/unofield.cxx#2152> which is throwing up an Unknown Property Exception at <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sw/source/core/unocore/unofield.cxx#2165> One is sw's implementation while the other is editeng's implementation. Moggi was of the opinion that the setPropertyValue() from editeng couldn't be called here. But the current one is unable to support that property (UNO_TC_PROP_TEXTFIELD_TYPE). How would it be possible to proceed?I'm influenced by this comment <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/offapi/com/sun/star/text/textfield/Type.idl#19> when I say the above.Also, I did a '#define UNO_NAME_TEXT_FIELD_TYPE ""TextFieldType""' in <opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sw/inc/unoprnms.hxx> taking other properties from here <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/include/editeng/unonames.hxx> as an example. But I'm unsure if this is the right way to proceed.Since I've mentioned '[optional, property]long TextFieldType;' as optional in <opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/offapi/com/sun/star/text/textfield/ExtendedUser.idl>, I might need a boolean to indicate when 'setPropertyValue()' must be called for each of the fields from <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/offapi/com/sun/star/text/textfield/Type.idl> in here <http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/xmloff/source/text/txtfldi.cxx#706>. I don't think we need to call it for all 15 properties all the time. How do I use the boolean variable - like for example - how do I use it to indicate when to set EXTENDED_TIME and when not to..?Regarding the comment thread on the bug page - you'd asked what happens when I run it without removing certain stuff from content.xml . The exact same exceptions are thrown in the order of Comment 13 first and then Comment 14.On a side note, I would like to say that I'm doing this coz you'd asked me to work on LO code (with respect to GSoC) and this was a bug reported by you. Since you didn't remember filing this bug, if there is something else that you'd want me to work on, please do tell.I would have loved to work on creating MAR files (from onlineupdate module), and still do think that's the best thing to do as it would mean I would get a headstart when it comes to the actual coding period begin dates, and had sent a mail to you regarding that. But on not receivng a reply, I'd assumed you didn't want me to work on that. Please do indicate what you think I should be working on.Thanks :-)",1,25556,2016/4/4 14:12,2016/4/4 14:12,0,ABANDONED,5,23,4,20,1,negative

38109,"Patch Set 1:Is this necessary after 2428e1164b5f38da9fc2f24c5bb478e548f54a6f?Christian, sorry about the brief commit message. I was a bit upset that the headless patch was merged even though the ESC asked the author not to merge it in its current form. The opengl situation on our Android port is a bit unclear. On one hand, we disable opengl in configure, OTOH it seems we build most of the opengl code in vcl. My commit just restored that status quo, fixing the build. I also verified that the build result actually works. :-)Given that at the end Android uses cairo to render the tiles, the opengl code is not useful on Android. However, probably it's a good idea to not work on removing it from the Android binary till it's not clear if those opengl #ifdefs will go away or not in the long run. (Currently we have those ifdefs, but it's possible they will be reverted, it's not clear yet.)",1,25623,2016/3/29 21:59,2016/3/29 22:36,0,ABANDONED,1,2,5,10,1,negative

38491,"Patch Set 1:Hi Katarina,The reason it was done that way (by me) is that the toolbar button is a split button (i.e. it can be clicked on the button *or* on the dropdown part), so it's possible to apply the last used color easily. So the toolbar button shouldn't update with the current color, but instead show the last used one.",1,25939,2015/6/5 6:56,2015/6/5 7:04,0,ABANDONED,1,43,4,10,1,negative
38492,"Patch Set 1:Well, for me this is the desired result:1. A simple button (i.e. with ToolBoxItemBits::DROPDOWNONLY bits) should show the current color of the selected text/object.2. A split button (i.e. with ToolBoxItemBits::DROPDOWN bits) should initially show some common color, and later the last used one, for easy re-applying it on another text/object.3. All buttons of the same kind (simple vs split), and that are representing the same text attribute, should be synced, and show the same color, regardless whether they are on the toolbar or on the sidebar.This means that if we have .uno:Color on both the toolbar and the sidebar, and *both* are split buttons, they need to be synced - but with the last used color, not with the current one (i.e. if you move the cursor to a text with a different color, it shouldn't affect the button). That's why SvxColorToolBoxControl::StateChanged has the check for bSidebarType, so split buttons won't be updated with the current color, but keep the last used one. This bSidebarType is simply used for distinguish between simple and split buttons, allowing them to share the same code, it's just poorly named (because most of the buttons in the sidebar are simple buttons - except the ones from the text panel, and all the toolbar buttons are split ones).Now, this scenario of syncing split buttons is not yet implemented (and already reported in tdf#82438). The problem is that the last used color is stored inside PaletteManager, and we have separate instance of it for each visible button. This causes also that the last used color resets after closing and re-opening the toolbar (because SvxColorToolboxControl instances are destroyed together with the toolbar) - see tdf#61868, tdf#71413, tdf#72991, tdf#83789.One possible solution is to turn PaletteManager into a singleton, so we'll have only one instance, and could manage all visible buttons from there. That way we could also sync the ""recent colors"" palette between all visible pickers, and maybe also the currently chosen main palette. Right now each visible button has its own instance of all these settings. Even worse - right now each instance has its own list of all palettes and their colors, thus wasting resources. Such kind of things surely should be managed in a centralized way.",1,25939,2015/6/5 6:56,2015/6/5 7:04,0,ABANDONED,1,43,4,10,1,negative

We can always use the former, but I think later approach is better and cleaner way of doing things. We can sort-of know the order when the handlers would be called. With function pointers, we can precisely control the point at which the default handlers will be emitted; we can chain up to the parent in our default handler. This is similar to as we have done in lok_doc_view_class_init function for the widget class overriding their key_press_event, key_release_event etc.See: https://developer.gnome.org/gobject/unstable/gobject-Signals.htmlWith g_signal_connect-ed handlers, we would be having no idea which one would be called first.Currently this is not a huge problem; I can always make it work with g_signal_connect in g-d, but it would be cleaner otherwise, and in the long run.Regarding the ABI, yes we can add up as many new signals as up to today, but that leaves us with only one option of connecting to signals i.e g_signal_connect.

38806,"Patch Set 1:IMHO a much better way to improve CPU utilization, without overcommitting, would be to relax the dependencies on external projects a bit. A dependency of a library on external project is typically added by calling gb_LinkTarget_use_external_project; the current impl. delays building of any source file of the library until the external project is done, which is not necessary unless the external project generates a (public) header during build. This could be changed to depend only on the unpacked tarball and only the link target itself on the external project, possibly with a second argument forcing all to depend on the full external project (I do not know if this would be actually needed. A test build would show.)",1,26183,2015/9/24 0:25,2015/9/24 0:25,0,ABANDONED,7,18,3,10,1,negative

It does fix the specific bug, but currently, there are too many problems with ScPostIt/SdrCaptionObj lifetime management that need to be addressed in a consistent fasion, so currently I'm preparing a draft specification for discussion of what changes are planned and why they are needed. That spec does describe why currently deletion of the object in real document (when, e.g. the ScPostIt was deleted by user) crashes the Undo/Redo operation (where only pointers to now-deleted object are stored). That's why I don't update this patch (it should probably be abandoned for now?).Thank you for notes/correstions, and excuse me for not explaining the silence; I should have noted that earlier.",4,26397,2015/6/9 10:10,2015/6/16 15:01,172,ABANDONED,1,9,6,10,4,negative

When reading a git log, it is useful to have a few details on the rationale behind a change: what problem are you solving, what approach youÔÇÖve followed to fix it, etc. Examples of good commit messages are in PoeditÔÇÖs repo, this is a random example: https://github.com/vslavik/poedit/commit/d6af8b16f386c92af4ad3107346990a57d92d4c5(Of course, you donÔÇÖt have to write novels out of commit messages, but most of the time a few explaining sentences are prefectly fine.)2. We have just (like a few days ago!) migrated to our own instance of Bugzilla (we used FreeDesktop.orgÔÇÖs one before), so thw way we refer to bugs has changed: instead of using the abbreviation ÔÇ£fdo#ÔÇØ we now use ÔÇ£tdf#ÔÇØ.Thanks again your your submission!",1,26678,2015/2/8 7:46,2015/2/8 7:46,0,ABANDONED,1,45,3,5,1,negative

There is no implementation of updown bars for line chart as of today(import part is almost missing), we might have to implement it the way it has been implemented for Stock Chart/Candle Stick Chart.I had checked the feasibility of reusing this code, since one or more properties were specific to Stock chart I had to add a property instead of reusing the existing ""UpDown"" property.We have logged a separate issue for handling the rest of properties for updown bars associated to line charts.

40250,"Patch Set 1: This need some tweaks before it is mergedWhile the code looks ok from a first glance (I didn't verify yet) it will not solve the problem. The IANA language tag registry does not define default scripts for languages, it only defines suppress-script for a few. For all other languages you'd still not get the script. See instdir/share/liblangtag/language-subtag-registry.xmlFurthermore, we avoid at all costs to pull in liblangtag if not necessary (hence all the internal handling of known tags in canonicalize()) because (despite that the rsc resource compiler can't use liblangtag) it needs a significant amount of time to initialize its data, which at startup would add ~10% of startup time. If VCL needed liblangtag already just to display some glyphs that would be a heavy drawback.My suggestion to solve this would be to add an extra default script field in i18nlangtag/source/isolang/isolang.cxx to aImplIsoLangEntries and aImplBcp47CountryEntries and change the lang::Locale returns of MsLangId::Conversion::*() methods to a struct of Locale and additionally a Script field. They are used only internally by LanguageTag and not part of a public API so that would be no problem. Of course doing so would need quite some changes and finding all default scripts for all known locales would be a lot of investigation work.",1,27350,2013/11/28 11:07,2013/11/28 13:08,2,ABANDONED,4,88,2,3,1,negative

There's too many files to check by hand so a automated or at least semi-automated approach is necessary.Anyway, thanks for the comments! I hadn't thought about indirect inclusion. How about this refined approach:For each .cxx file,1) Use the brute-force approach to find candidate headers for removal, and use ""g++ -H"" to dump out a full list of all included headers 2) If a candidate header shows up *once* in the list from g++ -H, it's definitely unnecessary and we remove it. If it shows up more than once (via indirect inclusion), then we leave it alone for now.This should give a smaller list of includes to remove, or in the case of no indirect inclusions, the same list.Are there any other pitfalls that are worth looking out for?

40884,"Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisHi Mathias,first thanks for your patch. It is great start; Well, it does some non-standard things. I suggest to re-shufle it a bit :-)1. You already mentioned that you were unsure about    downloading the files inside configure. I suggest to   do it using the download script.   You might already see the many @FILENAME@ entries in   ooo.lst.in. They are optional. If you do not define such    variable in configure, it will be empty in the generated    ooo.lst file and it will not be downloaded.2. If you use download, it will get the files into the   $TARFILE_LOCATION instead of $SRC_ROOT/moz/zipped.      I suggest to modify the related makefiles in ""moz""    module to find the .zip archives in $TARFILE_LOCATION   Note that this approach follows the current trends.   In the past, we copied many 3rd party tarballs into   the related build subdirectories. We do not longer   do it. We already updated most makefiles to unpack the    tarballs directly from the $TARFILE_LOCATION.   3. I suggest to do not copy the dlls in configure because    it is not typical. Instead, I suggest to define variables   that will point to the files. Then you could copy the   files in the makefile that need to use the dlls.4. Please, do not remove the TABs from configure.in from    lines 4469-4515. These lines are copied into ""Makefile""    that is later tested. TABs are important in Makefiles,   so your change breaks this test.Thanks a lot for working on it. Feel free to ask if you are in doubts.",1,27953,2012/10/14 21:24,2012/10/14 21:24,0,ABANDONED,1,67,2,2,1,negative

40893,"Patch Set 1: Do not submitHmm, I am confused by all the changes:1. In the dmake fix, it does not make sense to save   the number of read items and just increment it.      Instead, it would make sense to check if it really   did read the item, for example:      if (fread( (char *)&flhdr, sizeof(flhdr), 1, f ) != 1) return (-1);   2. In the lpsolve fix, it is not a good idea to redirect all   error messages to /dev/null. It would hide real build   errors as well.      Instead, it would be better to fix the lpsolve code   to do not produce warnigns at all.3. The concat-deps.c is strange as well. It is a similar   problem like in dmake.      IMHO, we need to return an error if it does not write   the whole item => you need to modify the function   print_fullpaths to return integer instead of void.   Then you could use something like:      if (fwrite(token, token_len, 1, stdout) != 1) return EIO;      Of course, you need to handle the print_fullpaths return   value where it is called.",1,27966,2012/10/18 23:44,2012/10/18 23:44,0,ABANDONED,3,21,2,2,3,negative

So, e.g., for make sw.all, submake in sal would run sal's unit tests after everything there was build, same for cppu etc. etc., finally then the last make (a subset--or subgraph--of tail_build) would (again) run all the unit tests after build.

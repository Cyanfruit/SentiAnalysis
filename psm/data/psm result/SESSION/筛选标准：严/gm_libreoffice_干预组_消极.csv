I couldn't find out when it was ""fixed"" after 4.3.Cancelling the selection is the easy fix for this, and seems to be the previous behaviour as well.  And it is also the behaviour for mouse-selected text.What I don't get is why mouse-selected and keyboard-selected text act differently.  That shouldn't be possible at this level."

It should be possible to close the dialog when user clicks somewhere else. Currently, only way to close the dialog is to hit again on the toolbar button.3. I think we should limit the dimensions of table user can create with this new toolbar button just like we do in desktop, because if we don't it would stick to the mouse movements and user will have a hard time to find an empty space to close the dialog button.

So for eg: if user closed the dialog with table dimensions 12 x 12 selected, the next time he opens it, it would still be at 12 x 12. The state should be reset everytime dialog is closed.5.

929,"Patch Set 8:(21 comments)So I have one general comment related to the concept and a few related to the actual implementation.I'm not sure if that is really a good approach. In general I think instead of trying to change the equation we should make it clear to the user that we could not layout his chart correctly and that he should look into fixing the layout. So a more make the user aware of the problems than trying to work around problems.I suggest that you contact the UX team and tell them about your idea and my concerns.Related to the code:I'm not happy with some of the special values, especially the use of 0 as formula length to signal that the formula length can be ignored. I think a cleaner solution is something like sal_Int32* pFormulaLength = NULL and require the caller to use a NULL pointer to signal that the parameter needs to be ignored. That makes IMHO the code cleaner as it is directly obvious that we are not talking about a zero length string.I'd also like to see a comment why the aValueString checks are necessary despite the earlier checks that this value is not handled in that place.I'm going to look into the localization issue that I saw as that looks like a serious problem.And finally I was unable to follow all corner cases in the new code. So if we are really going to merge this code, I'd like to see a unit test for nearly all special cases. Additionally a few comments explaining what we are doing would be helpful. Currently it is nearly impossible to figure out why some cases need special handling. An exmaple for that (which I have still no idea why it is correct) is that in one case we multiply nFormulaLength by 2 if aValueString is ""1"".This was a really review and I suggest that you start by talking to the UX guys.

This value alone says nothing about the rendered size. The unit px is equal to the 'user unit' at the place where px it currently used.

2369,"Patch Set 3:(1 comment)Thank you for your advice.I also think that the variable name ""aDocumentName"" is very misleading.1. About the insert point to decode URL.As you wrote, I think that the best way to convert is in PasswordDialog ctor.However, to reduce the influence I now was according to the method for the other formats(odf,etc...).For the other formats, probably insert points to decode URL are just before calling the UNO API, Document(MS)PasswordRequest(2). (e.g.   http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sfx2/source/appl/appopen.cxx#245  http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sw/source/filter/ww8/ww8par.cxx#5468)Somehow, those APIs want ""the name of the document""...

The tests I wrote were counting the number of times the timers trigger in a multi-timer scenario. What I had discovered is that there is a lack of consistency, which I have plans to fix/address.For example, when two timers have the same timeout and priority, one could get a very low trigger rate (or none at all). This is because the trigger logic always picks the one with highest priority that is next in line, and so can end up picking the same timer to trigger every time, starving the other(s).I have a patch to address this and also to fix make IdleTimer fire only when the process idles. >  > But I didn't read the unit test code too carefully - thanks so much > for re-basing the cleanups =) lets submit as/when CI builds it > cleanly if it can.The reason I had disabled the fail condition when the new tests were excluded is because the remaining code is useful in detecting timers that don't trigger during the watchdog timeout.

I mentioned this somewhere as a limitation. The reason for this is that the page size is the same, but the margins are removed/reduced. So the text is allowed to fill in more surface area.

I mentioned this somewhere as a limitation. The reason for this is that the page size is the same, but the margins are removed/reduced. So the text is allowed to fill in more surface area.

What I'm saying in the message is that there are no strong guarantees from the OS, and the tests _can_ fail (doesn't mean _will_ fail). I just don't know how often. I suspect they will not fail any more than other fragile tests fail, and far less often than jenkins fails randomly (I know because I tested extensively).I think we should disable only when there is evidence that it is not stable.I will replace the static buffer with dynamic one."

Any chance you can create one ? > Thanks !Depends what you mean by ""work."" The timers of course _do_ work, but that is not the problem I'm fixing. I'm fixing the issue with high idle CPU utilization. Periodic timers should reset their start time so that they re-fire only after the duration has expired. The issue, I found, is that Timer thinks it's ready to fire again at the next tick. Ticks come in for the _soonest_ next timer delay (this is because we really have only one system timer callback, and we need it to fire for the next timer in the queue). In the worst case they come in immediately (after 1ms) and in those cases Timer thinks it's ready to fire again, which it does. This doesn't cause any obvious problems, other than CPU utilization where there shouldn't be any (because Timer handles background jobs, like spellchecking, which wastes some CPU and returns, but the waste is proportional to the document size and number of documents open).It is clear from the code that nowhere is the start-time reset. Of course I had the luxury of debugging and seeing what was happening, but the code and my comments make it almost trivial to trace the variable in question and see that without changing it, it will trick Timer into firing again.

Isn't it better to change SwTxtFormatter::FormatLine to include check for that, and in that case just modify its SwTxtFormatInfo to return true from IsStop()? In feels more ""correct"", but may have wider consequencies."

4648,"Patch Set 1:> it checks adapter existence before enabling / disabling it > instead of checking everywhere,1st of all that's not true. You're just wrapping the check into a function call, so that decision is just hidden behind a function and still executed everytime, just hidden between two or three levels of indirection. This makes the code harder to understand, harder to get into for newcomers.Newcomers read Android's api to understand what's going on and are thrown off by wrappers that they have to track through different files.2nd enabling/disabling the adapter is only triggered/used once each. So this is far from ""everywhere"".3rd your (I assume it is yours, since you're defending it so much) code acquires the adapter way more often than the changed code, where once it is acquired, it is stored in the member variable(s). The old code always calls getDefaultAdapter(), take for example the getPairingDeviceName() function.1st time when calling isAvailable, that indirects to getAdapter that in turn calls getDefaultAdapter.2nd time in the check for a device name (uses getAdapter that indirects to getDefaultAdapter3rd time when returning the name.And this for each Bluetooth device that is found. > it should help to acquire adapter the proper way on  > higher platforms [1] instead of duplicating code everywhere.Again you're making it hard for me to take your argumentation seriously. This has been mentioned in the previous comments already. A) There's absolutely no reason to introduce runtime-version checks. This would not only complicate the code, but more importantly doing test on the various codepaths. I would personally object any change that introduces a runtime version check without actual need for it. If docs would say: function will be removed in next version of Android, that would be a different story. But for the foreseeable future, the functionality will remain the same, B) Even when you want to acquire the adapter depending on the version, then *one single public static method* is enough to do this, no need for a whole class that wraps's the BluetoothAdapter's API. Apart from acquiring the actual adapter, there are absolutely no changes in the API. > Plus you instantiate property directlynot sure what you mean with property, I guess calling the actual API on the adapter? Yes, indeed I do it directly, since I believe in KISS - and I cannot think of anything simpler than just calling the function that is properly documented in the API docs, that every Android developer having dealt with BT already knows... >  but I was trying to init them in constructors only to > avoid mess.I absolutely cannot follow where. The Operator-wrapper's constructor is empty. And for launching the activities, you use intents, not constructors. I cannot find any occurrence where you'd pass the adapter in a constructor. (and also don't see a benefit), as it's static and can just be obtained on a if-needed basis. > Null checks is just element of style so I can close my > eyes on this part.I absolutely don't understand this comment either. You have *plenty* of null checks in the operator and in other places of the code, and they are the most straightforward/only way to check whether something is null. It also makes it immediately clear to the person reading the code that whatever is bound to the check won't happen because that adapter is null.  > Anyway my vote seems to be ignored at all.It is not that it is ignored, just that I have a completely different view on this topic. I want the code to be straightforward, easy to understand by people not familiar with it (just like I was before writing this patch. I neither had a take at android development, let alone the remote). I find all those redirections highly irritating. KISS should be the prime goal here.

You're just wrapping the check into a function call, so that decision is just hidden behind a function and still executed everytime, just hidden between two or three levels of indirection. This makes the code harder to understand, harder to get into for newcomers.Newcomers read Android's api to understand what's going on and are thrown off by wrappers that they have to track through different files.2nd enabling/disabling the adapter is only triggered/used once each. So this is far from ""everywhere"".3rd your (I assume it is yours, since you're defending it so much) code acquires the adapter way more often than the changed code, where once it is acquired, it is stored in the member variable(s). The old code always calls getDefaultAdapter(), take for example the getPairingDeviceName() function.1st time when calling isAvailable, that indirects to getAdapter that in turn calls getDefaultAdapter.2nd time in the check for a device name (uses getAdapter that indirects to getDefaultAdapter3rd time when returning the name.And this for each Bluetooth device that is found. > it should help to acquire adapter the proper way on  > higher platforms [1] instead of duplicating code everywhere.Again you're making it hard for me to take your argumentation seriously. This has been mentioned in the previous comments already. A) There's absolutely no reason to introduce runtime-version checks. This would not only complicate the code, but more importantly doing test on the various codepaths. I would personally object any change that introduces a runtime version check without actual need for it. If docs would say: function will be removed in next version of Android, that would be a different story. But for the foreseeable future, the functionality will remain the same, B) Even when you want to acquire the adapter depending on the version, then *one single public static method* is enough to do this, no need for a whole class that wraps's the BluetoothAdapter's API. Apart from acquiring the actual adapter, there are absolutely no changes in the API. > Plus you instantiate property directlynot sure what you mean with property, I guess calling the actual API on the adapter? Yes, indeed I do it directly, since I believe in KISS - and I cannot think of anything simpler than just calling the function that is properly documented in the API docs, that every Android developer having dealt with BT already knows... >  but I was trying to init them in constructors only to > avoid mess.I absolutely cannot follow where. The Operator-wrapper's constructor is empty. And for launching the activities, you use intents, not constructors. I cannot find any occurrence where you'd pass the adapter in a constructor. (and also don't see a benefit), as it's static and can just be obtained on a if-needed basis. > Null checks is just element of style so I can close my > eyes on this part.I absolutely don't understand this comment either. You have *plenty* of null checks in the operator and in other places of the code, and they are the most straightforward/only way to check whether something is null. It also makes it immediately clear to the person reading the code that whatever is bound to the check won't happen because that adapter is null.  > Anyway my vote seems to be ignored at all.It is not that it is ignored, just that I have a completely different view on this topic. I want the code to be straightforward, easy to understand by people not familiar with it (just like I was before writing this patch. I neither had a take at android development, let alone the remote). I find all those redirections highly irritating. KISS should be the prime goal here.

7356,"Patch Set 1: This need some tweaks before it is mergedWork in progress. This is a quite complex dialog, full of corner conditions1) Widget sizes should be adjusted at will2) The Line preview (CTL_PREVIEW) need to be fixed for correct display3) To test the dialog: Create a spreadsheet with one graphic object and one line chart. 4) Inside the chart, select the data series line object and click ""format selection"". The icon sub-dialog now appears. In the icon sub-dialog, the menu button allows many choices. The #define scalars for the menu choices had to be adjusted.

9706,"Patch Set 2: Verified; Looks good to me, approveduploaded a new patch set just to rebase on dtardon's makefile renaming, nothing changed here.a) For aligning things the trick is to have *another* size group with the labels in it, that way they all request the same size and it works out as expected.Well, it should, it appears I have a small bug in how that works. It seems that margins should be part of the request, but I'm adding those on after the request, not as part of the request. But we can workaround that by putting a one element box around the elements with margins and put those boxes into the size group instead. That way it works now, and will continue to work after I change the request+margin logic.b) The tristates are a pain, I thought they would be very rare elements. Catch is that they are always set to ""state unknown"" on .ui load, while in .src load they default to ""state nocheck"". So, yeah, to be super sure that the logic is unchanged its best to set them explicitly in .cxx to ""state nocheck"".

The old ones weren't resizeable because of the lack-of-layout defect.   - some pixel size-requests on edit-boxes, maybe worried about its default size?

12556,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1(1 comment)The idea to merge the two threads (callback handler and tile rendering) is reasonable, but we should discuss the approach.The starvation you noticed happens because you are using the tile-queue, which is designed for... well, yes, tiles! :)It reorders the messages such that it renders tiles in large blocks first. So with heavy typing the callback messages always end up getting overtaken by tiles, which the queue explicitly favors, thereby starving callback events.So this is one problem with the current implementation. I think the tiles should have its own queue, and callbacks a separate one. The thread that pumps them would process one callback, then one tile-rendering.Another issue with combining these threads is that there will be reduction in performance. This is because before and after rendering a tile there is significant work being done that does *not* execute with the Solar lock. This code (mostly encoding to PNG) is CPU intensive and can run in parallel to other code (even to other rendering calls).Finally, I have submitted my patch (342125b8ea) to fix the missing tiles issue. Should be easier to read than describe it here (it's only +27, -6). It comes with detailed commit log too.

13240,Patch Set 1:(1 comment)So this is going to be an ugly one.We are now hitting a limitation of the current test framework. Currently all our tests don't have access to the UI configuration as it breaks the tests. Now I don't remember why I went the way of pointing the ui path to the user profile but it still seems to be necessary. Back when I wrote that code there were however no UI files so it was still so that the whole UI should have worked. Now with the UI files this is no longer true and pointing the UI config path to a place that does not the UI files causes an exception and later a crash.I will need some time to get back into the details of the configuration management during the tests.,1,25668,2016-03-21 14:48:24,2016-03-21 14:48:24,0,ABANDONED,3.0,60.0,3,7,2,negative,Patch Set 1:(1 comment)So this is going to be an ugly one.We are now hitting a limitation of the current test framework. Currently all our tests don't have access to the UI configuration as it breaks the tests. Now I don't remember why I went the way of pointing the ui path to the user profile but it still seems to be necessary. Back when I wrote that code there were however no UI files so it was still so that the whole UI should have worked. Now with the UI files this is no longer true and pointing the UI config path to a place that does not the UI files causes an exception and later a crash.I will need some time to get back into the details of the configuration management during the tests.

13381,"Patch Set 5:Hey William,so what I propose is that we take the performance tests that have been pushed already to master and start from a purely algorithmic perspective.I had a short discussion with Eike and Kohei and reading the patch and looking at the results of the performance test I feel that we can easily win much more by doing some algorithm improvements to the subtotal code.If you look at the current callgrind output we are basically inserting n rows and execute the same operations in the code for each inserted row. Most of these operations however are not necessary for n-1 iterations as the only valid update happens in the last iteration. Examples for that are starting and stopping listeners, updating references.Not all of these places are easy to refactor but I think all in all we can find an incremental approach moving to this goal.

13441,"Patch Set 4:So looking at 1d1fd4d2b6ee1db407a8f16dee84900b4f0ff5b2's use of TryUrlFromSystemPathAsString in the SwMailMergeDlg InsertPathHdl (sw/source/ui/envelp/mailmrge.cxx).  The original content of m_pPathED/sPath is either known to be a URL (pModOpt->GetMailingPath(), aPathOpt.GetWorkPath(), xFP->getDirectory()), in which case it is unfortunate that that information was thrown away in the first place.  Or it is some text the user created in m_pPathED.

13560,"Patch Set 1:Well, for me this is the desired result:1. A simple button (i.e. with ToolBoxItemBits::DROPDOWNONLY bits) should show the current color of the selected text/object.2. A split button (i.e. with ToolBoxItemBits::DROPDOWN bits) should initially show some common color, and later the last used one, for easy re-applying it on another text/object.3. All buttons of the same kind (simple vs split), and that are representing the same text attribute, should be synced, and show the same color, regardless whether they are on the toolbar or on the sidebar.This means that if we have .uno:Color on both the toolbar and the sidebar, and *both* are split buttons, they need to be synced - but with the last used color, not with the current one (i.e. if you move the cursor to a text with a different color, it shouldn't affect the button). That's why SvxColorToolBoxControl::StateChanged has the check for bSidebarType, so split buttons won't be updated with the current color, but keep the last used one. This bSidebarType is simply used for distinguish between simple and split buttons, allowing them to share the same code, it's just poorly named (because most of the buttons in the sidebar are simple buttons - except the ones from the text panel, and all the toolbar buttons are split ones).Now, this scenario of syncing split buttons is not yet implemented (and already reported in tdf#82438). The problem is that the last used color is stored inside PaletteManager, and we have separate instance of it for each visible button. This causes also that the last used color resets after closing and re-opening the toolbar (because SvxColorToolboxControl instances are destroyed together with the toolbar) - see tdf#61868, tdf#71413, tdf#72991, tdf#83789.One possible solution is to turn PaletteManager into a singleton, so we'll have only one instance, and could manage all visible buttons from there. That way we could also sync the ""recent colors"" palette between all visible pickers, and maybe also the currently chosen main palette.

14483,"Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1sorry but i think that with the ""brute force of removing each include one by one"" approach there is a significant risk that you introduce more problems than are solved:1. we want each header file to be ""complete"" in the sense that it would build successfully as a compilation unit on its own; it should not depend on some other header being included before it into a source file to provide the types it uses, it should either include a header that declares the needed type, or contain a ""forward declaration"" of it.2. removing an include from a source file because there is another include in the source file that transitively brings in the needed include is also undesirable: some time later somebody will refactor the code and reomve soem include that is no longer directly needed and then it turns out that there are a lot of errors that need fixing because the source file was relying on indirectly included files.3. it's also too easy to remove platform dependent or configuration dependent include this way; some of the code is behind some #ifdef.  Ok, this is a more general problem and you have to be aware of it whatever approach you use.  best to build with --enable-dbgutil to get all the debug code built.an obvious example of the problem is the 	accessibility/inc/pch/precompiled_acc.hxx which is quite empty after the patch; the PCH is an exception anyway since putting more stuff into it may actually speed things up...it's probably much easier to use the include-what-you-use tool to remove the unnecessary includes because that tool will not suggest removing headers that declare types that are actually used, thus should prevent the problems 1 and 2.in my experience the tool is still not perfect though and you still have to manually review the add/remove advice it prints out.",2,26726,2014-11-18 10:06:31,2014-11-18 17:59:34,7,ABANDONED,98.0,419.0,5,12,2,negative,"accessibility/inc/pch/precompiled_acc.hxx which is quite empty after the patch; the PCH is an exception anyway since putting more stuff into it may actually speed things up...it's probably much easier to use the include-what-you-use tool to remove the unnecessary includes because that tool will not suggest removing headers that declare types that are actually used, thus should prevent the problems 1 and 2.in my experience the tool is still not perfect though and you still have to manually review the add/remove advice it prints out."""

But your current change is a step backward in terms of 1).The best strategy for this use case is to use o3tl::heap_ptr to replace auto_ptr, and call heap_ptr's release() when passing it to ptr_set.  Then the code remains exception safe and we can get rid of auto_ptr."

15475,"Patch Set 1: (4 inline comments)1) IMHO the negative year fix should go in independently of the time zone issue.3) Why should DateTimeRange contain only one time zone, as opposed to one for   the start value and one for the end value?3) You add time zone information to dates. I don't know the meaning of that.   What would it mean, how would it behave, what would it be used for?   For example, naively, one would think that combining a date with a time,   one would get a datetime. How does one get a datetime by combining   2003-05-17+05 with 23:00-06?   FWIW, SQL does not define a DATE WITH TIME ZONE type.4) I have my doubts about time-zoned time without a date.   How do you convert 20:00+00 to time zone +10?   Just ""wrap around"" modulo 24, i.e. make it 06:00+10?   If you answer yes to that question (that is, always compute modulo 24),   then what is the difference between 06:00+11 and 06:00-13?   The difference only makes sense if one speaks of dates...   Which says that timezones don't make sense unless we know at what date   to apply them.   FWIW, SQL defines a TIME WITH TIME ZONE TYPE, *but* here's what   the PostgreSQL documentation has to say about it:   The type time with time zone is defined by the SQL standard, but the definition exhibits properties which lead to questionable usefulness. In most cases, a combination of date, time, timestamp without time zone, and timestamp with time zone should provide a complete range of date/time functionality required by any application.   (...) we recommend using date/time types that contain both date and time when using time zones. We do not recommend using the type time with time zone (though it is supported by PostgreSQL for legacy applications and for compliance with the SQL standard).I have half a mind to add timezone *only* to DateTime and DateTimeRange,not to Date and not to Time. Note that this would more-or-less eliminateall conversion problems, and ""unlock"" the scenario ""don't add timezoneto structs, but convert everything to UTC"", since conversion of datetimevalues across timezones is AFAIK well-defined. ""Convert everything to UTC""is SQL's behaviour; in SQL all non-timezoned values are assumed to be atlocal time and a date is converted to the timestamp ""same date at time 00:00"".Alternative approach to your ""isTimezoned"": have a separate struct ""DateTimeTZ""?Your ""isTimezoned"" flag should IMHO be called ""isUTC"".Do we actually *need* *any* ""unknown timezone / local timezone"" value in memory?We could just make some assumption (UTC or local TZ) on import/parse/readand store only UTC in memory. Oh, but it would be convenient for our APIs to havethe capacity to take implicitly-localTZ values, yes.If we go the ""assume that values without explicit time zone are in local time"" route,then that flag should be called ""isUTC"".So, I've spoken of what SQL does as a reference;https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/LibreOffice4#Changes_deferred_until_4.1mentions XMLSchema-2. Let's see what it does for another reference: - It (optionally) timezones everything: date, time and datetime. - I don't see a datetimerange in it. - It understands a date as a 24-hour interval   (a DateTimeRange, from date 00:00:00.00000000 to 23:59:59.999999999 for most days,    that is except for leap seconds),    while SQL seems to consider it more like an instant, time 00:00 at that day. - A value without timezone is ""unknown timezone"" and not comparable   to a value with timezone, but on the other hand, section 3.2.7 also calls   untimezoned values ""local values"", which supports the idea that they are   ""local time"".

I don't know the meaning of that.   What would it mean, how would it behave, what would it be used for?   For example, naively, one would think that combining a date with a time,   one would get a datetime. How does one get a datetime by combining   2003-05-17+05 with 23:00-06?   FWIW, SQL does not define a DATE WITH TIME ZONE type.4) I have my doubts about time-zoned time without a date.   How do you convert 20:00+00 to time zone +10?   Just ""wrap around"" modulo 24, i.e. make it 06:00+10?   If you answer yes to that question (that is, always compute modulo 24),   then what is the difference between 06:00+11 and 06:00-13?   The difference only makes sense if one speaks of dates...   Which says that timezones don't make sense unless we know at what date   to apply them.   FWIW, SQL defines a TIME WITH TIME ZONE TYPE, *but* here's what   the PostgreSQL documentation has to say about it:   The type time with time zone is defined by the SQL standard, but the definition exhibits properties which lead to questionable usefulness. In most cases, a combination of date, time, timestamp without time zone, and timestamp with time zone should provide a complete range of date/time functionality required by any application.   (...) we recommend using date/time types that contain both date and time when using time zones. We do not recommend using the type time with time zone (though it is supported by PostgreSQL for legacy applications and for compliance with the SQL standard).I have half a mind to add timezone *only* to DateTime and DateTimeRange,not to Date and not to Time. Note that this would more-or-less eliminateall conversion problems, and ""unlock"" the scenario ""don't add timezoneto structs, but convert everything to UTC"", since conversion of datetimevalues across timezones is AFAIK well-defined. ""Convert everything to UTC""is SQL's behaviour; in SQL all non-timezoned values are assumed to be atlocal time and a date is converted to the timestamp ""same date at time 00:00"".Alternative approach to your ""isTimezoned"": have a separate struct ""DateTimeTZ""?Your ""isTimezoned"" flag should IMHO be called ""isUTC"".Do we actually *need* *any* ""unknown timezone / local timezone"" value in memory?We could just make some assumption (UTC or local TZ) on import/parse/readand store only UTC in memory. Oh, but it would be convenient for our APIs to havethe capacity to take implicitly-localTZ values, yes.If we go the ""assume that values without explicit time zone are in local time"" route,then that flag should be called ""isUTC"".So, I've spoken of what SQL does as a reference;https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/LibreOffice4#Changes_deferred_until_4.1mentions XMLSchema-2. Let's see what it does for another reference: - It (optionally) timezones everything: date, time and datetime. - I don't see a datetimerange in it. - It understands a date as a 24-hour interval   (a DateTimeRange, from date 00:00:00.00000000 to 23:59:59.999999999 for most days,    that is except for leap seconds),    while SQL seems to consider it more like an instant, time 00:00 at that day. - A value without timezone is ""unknown timezone"" and not comparable   to a value with timezone, but on the other hand, section 3.2.7 also calls   untimezoned values ""local values"", which supports the idea that they are   ""local time"". But ""local time"" is unspecified in an interchange file format,   because the file may move from one timezone to the other.   In SQL, everything is convertible/comparable because each session has an   active ""local timezone"" which is used for all untimezoned values.Pragmatically, how close to XMLSchema-2 do we need to be?1) Is there any part of ODF/OOXML/any other format where we need to import   or export a date with timezone?2) Is there any part of ODF/OOXML/any other format where we need to import   or export a time (*not* datetime) with timezone?3) Is there any part of ODF/OOXML/any other format where there can be a   datetime with timezone OR a datetime without timezone and the difference   has some semantic significance (other than ""interpret value without   timezone in this timezone"").4) Is there any part of ODF/OOXML/any other format where we need to import   or export a datetime value without timezone and preserve unmodified as   without timezone?

The issue is muddled a bit because the UNOstructs are both our internal working structures and our ""external""(scripting) API date types. I'll discuss the two uses separately.I'm really torn on this issue. Seeing LibreOffice as a programmingplatform, the UNO structs are the data types of our ""standardlibrary"". By putting explicit timezone in the structs, we makethe programmer's life easier because (s)he does not have todeal with converting to UTC before making an API call. We alsomake hir life more difficult because (s)he has to deal with non-UTCtime for each *result* of an API call.Here's what I would consider optimal: - All our (date)time API calls take and return UTC (date)time or   untimezoned (date)time. That is, our (date)time structure   does not have a timezone in it. It is UTC or untimezoned. - We provide a UNO service that provides utility functions that   1) convert between timezoned (date)time on the one hand       and untimezoned time in a caller-provided timezone on       the other hand (*two* incoming arguments: a (date)time       *and* an offset to UTC).   2) convert between timezoned (date)time on the one hand       and untimezoned time in local timezone on the other hand       (*one* incoming argument: a (date)time). - Hmm... As an alternative / complement to the above service,   the (date)time struct constructors takes an optional argument   that says ""the values I'm giving are UTC / localtime / untimezoned""   (we add a new enum with these three values), and the constructor   makes the appropriate localtime->UTC conversion.   Can we do that in UNO? I'm unsure. Actually, I don't expect so.The spanner in the works, and the reason I'm torn, is timezoned dates.They don't fit the above schema. I hate them. For timezoned dates,we *have* to include an explicit timezone in the struct, or expect thatcode will store timezoned dates as a pair of values (a date and anoffset) - bleh.

How about this refined approach:For each .cxx file,1) Use the brute-force approach to find candidate headers for removal, and use ""g++ -H"" to dump out a full list of all included headers 2) If a candidate header shows up *once* in the list from g++ -H, it's definitely unnecessary and we remove it.

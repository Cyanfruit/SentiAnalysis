510,3899,"Patch Set 7: Code-Review-1(8 comments)Thanks for your partial review, Laurent! While doing a review on my own and incorporating your review, I found a problem that when only the UML file is changed, the approach won't work too.I re-investigated this problem and thought about it a while... the nicest way would be to avoid loosing the information on the resources in scope during the minimization; that is, minimizing the scope but storing somewhere which resources had been in scope at the beginning. Then it would be very easy to check if a .di file was in the scope.Ideally, we could change that in the ComparisonScopeBuilder. However, e.g. the EMFModelProvider calls the IdenticalResourceMinimizer before the ComparisonScopeBuilder is even used to create the scope later down the road. Thus, there is no central point that we could change in order to retain the list of original resources in the scope.(On a side note, I stumbled across a potential source if problems: SynchronizationModel.getResources() is created lazily. If getResources() is called before the minimizer is applied to the SynchronizationModel, it'll contains the original set of resources also after the minimization. If it is called afterwards, it won't contain it. Sometimes getResources() it is called before the minimization step, such as in org.eclipse.emf.compare.ide.ui.internal.logical.EMFModelProvider.getOrComputeLogicalModel(IFile, ResourceMappingContext, IProgressMonitor), sometimes it isn't. So we cannot trust that the getResources() is minimal or not. I'll add a task for myself to open a separate BR on that.)So my best remaining idea so far: remove the comparison scope adapter introduced in this review again and instead introduce a postprocessor that checks if any .di file exists for the matched resources and if yes, mark the comparison as a PapyrusComparison.For marking the comparison as a Papyrus, the nicest way would be introducing a context field into the Comparison model. If we don't want to change the comparison model, we again could add an adapter to it in order to mark it. But that's not particularly clean :)What do you think about the above mentioned postprocessor approach? It is not super-efficient, as we theoretically had the information already that we obtain again in the postprocessor.

Not sure if the filtered results look confusing or non-relevant due to the above issue of not restricting the match to just the name or if it is due to the non-subsequent matching.

2681,21114,"Patch Set 1:There are three groups of changes in this change-set:(a) update the Properties View implementation to reuse the same SWT controls    for its tabs when the selection changes to another single or multiple    selection presenting the same Views (according to the property-sheet model).    This is a ""compatible"" selection	(b) update the DataSource and ModelElement APIs that provide the source of    data bindings in the Properties View to allow a compatible selection to be    injected into the SWT controls already showing	(c) implementation of delegating observables that support the ModelElements'    dynamic updating of their data-binding sources	Part (a) is largely just a matter of updating the DefaultDisplayEngine to detect that the set of Views it asked to provide tab-descriptors for is the same as the set of Views for which it last provided tabs.  In this case, the existing tabs and all of their controls are re-used and the new selection is pushed into the DataSource that is currently feeding these controls.  Hopefully, the infrastructural changes in parts (b) and (c) that make this possible will allow us to further refine the re-use of controls such that any View will only be created once and can be swapped in and out of tabs using PageBooks.Part (b) updates the DataSource to support replacement of its selection.  On injection of a new selection, a notification is broadcast to announce the change and ModelElements listening to the DataSource update themselves to pick up the new selection.  This entails to fundamental changes in the way that ModelElements work:  (i) the ModelElementFactory now tells a newly created ModelElement which      factory created it, so that the ModelElement can delegate to that factory the      update for a new selection.  This is necessary because it is the factory that      knew how to unpack from the selection what the ModelElement needs when      creating the  element, so it is the best able to update the element later.  All      of the various ModelElementFactory implementations add this new capability      to update an existing element with a new selection	    (ii) when a ModelElement creates an IObservable for one of its properties, it      now wraps that observable in a new delegator pattern.  The delegator is      what ends up ultimately being bound to SWT controls.  To ensure that we      don't have to rebuild those bindings every time the selection changes      (which would entail considerable API churn to make accessible after the      fact), these observable delegators allow their delegates to be replaced at      any time (assuming that the replacement is the same kind of observable,      based on the ""compatible selection"").  Replacing the delegate fires the      usual observable change event, which updates the UI accordingly via the      bindings.	  Part (c) is the implementation of the delegating observables.  They ensure that the entire contract of the underlying observable is provided (including all custom interfaces such as ICommitListener) via the dynamic proxy class mechanism.  The usual contract of observables is implemented, including tracking the invocation of getter methods, all verified with a fairly comprehensive suite of JUnits tests.",1,9145,2014-05-23 02:44:04,2014-05-26 19:58:45,89,MERGED,70.0,3980.0,2,4,6,positive,"  Part (c) is the implementation of the delegating observables.

3420,25772,"Patch Set 2:> This is by design. Merely changing null.unboxInt() to return 0 instead of -1 will break MANY things only in the state system (like stack attributes, off the top of my head). And that's without talking about views.There's a few things broken as it is now:- You can't get a -1 Int value from the factory method but you can get one using incrementAttribute() on a -2 Int value- Calling incrementAttribute() on this -1 Int value skips 0 and goes to 1.- The State System Explorer view cannot display a factory-made -1 Int value (as it is nullValue), it shows a blank value.If there is any code that is using the unboxed value of nullValue to check for null, that is badly designed code because it cannot differentiate with a real Int of that same value, it should use isNull(). I believe it's better to bite the bullet and correct that code now. Hopefully all of it is fixed by the patch now.Mathematically, I think it makes more sense to use zero as the null value's numerical value.> This is also by design. If we start to allow unboxing from one type to another, people might stop caring about what the actual type is, and always unbox their things into longs for example, doing costly casts over and over.It's a point to consider, but I prefer to give the benefit of the doubt and the flexibility to the designers. In the code I'm doing now, I have to do floating point mathematical operations on a list of state values that can be a mix of Int, Long, Double or nullValue. Using unboxDouble() gives much cleaner code than having a if-else or switch statement on the value Type to figure out the correct unboxing method.The unit tests should be correct now. The LTTng kernel state system creates a Threads/-1 attribute because the first events arrive before the Current_thread attribute has any value set. I considered updating the expected test state system with these events using the Threads/0 attribute (due to the current thread nullValue's int value), but decided against it because it would still be incorrect to consider that these events occurred in the swapper (0) thread.

5494,30761,"Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisI like the idea to cleanup certain timestamps during checkout, but we can't do this so blindly. It's wrong to always update the index entry with the timestamp of the associated work-tree file. Sometimes we keep index entries although we know that the filesystem has already been modified. Simply copying the filesystem timestamp would be wrong. Think about this: git init touch f.txt        // lastmodified(f.txt) = m git add f.txt      // timestamp(indexEntry(f.txt)) = m git commit -m initial git checkout -b side touch g.txt git add g.txt git commit -m modified1 sleep 2            // to avoid smudged entries echo x > f.txt     // lastmodified(f.txt) = m + 1 git checkout masterIn the last checkout we want to keep the index entry for f.txt with the timestamp of 'm' although we know that thefilesystem has already 'm + 1'Another issue is that this may be quite expensive (not sure about it).

I agree that the display of ORIG_HEAD, FETCH_HEAD and MERGE_HEAD should be avoided for the 99% of the cases.

My suggestion: By default always show them when they point to something which is not referenced by any other ref. And add a preference which allows me to show them always & never.Here is my argument: Even middle-experienced EGit users start doing rebases quite soon. If I am in the middle of a rebase I sometimes want to compare the state before I started the rebase operation to the current state. Without ORIG_HEAD the state where I startet rebase is lost.Another argument: Even the gerrit Web-UI suggest the usage of FETCH_HEAD.

8031,36042,"Patch Set 1:Hi J Langley,First, thanks for the contribution!   Your patch looks excellent.  I think we should easily be able to get this incorporated into ECF 3.9.1.A few very minor comments:1) For the ScpBrowseFileTransferFactory class:  Is there any need to have this class be in a new (and exported) package org.eclipse.ecf.provider.filetransfer.scp?  Unless you already know that this class is going to be accessed by some other bundle, I would prefer that it be placed in the existing internal package:  org.eclipse.ecf.internal.provider.scp.  That way, the scp provider code would all be exposed by internal-only packages...and this browse edition would be consistent with the retrieve and send classes (which are in the internal package now).2) If you move the ScpBrowseFileTransferFactory class into the internal package, it would make it unnecessary to export a new package in the manifest.mf.  For maintenance, it would be nice for us to continue to not export any non-internal packages.I can make the following changes if you wish...just wanted to include them in public review:3) The Bundle-Version in the manifest should be updated from 2.0.100.qualifier to 2.1.0.qualifier (minor revision because of new functionality).4) In org.eclipse.ecf.internal.provider.filetransfer.scp.ScpFileSystemBrowser there are a couple of commented lines:		// FIXME - This code is from ScpOutgoingFileTransfer, but it throws		// exceptions		// if (scpUtil != null) {		// scpUtil.sendZeroToStream(outputStream);		// scpUtil.checkAck(inputStream);		// }Probably best just to remove these lines...unless they are needed for the browse.But overall things look great.  I will fix 3 and 4 prior to commit if you prefer.

8092,36238,"Patch Set 1:A further change in how Model Explorer manages refresh, to avoid recalculating the entire tree structure on every model edit, which doesn't scale well on large models.First, the Model Explorer's resource-set listener now only schedules structural refreshes for the specific objects that notified changes.Second, the UMLLabelProvider fires LabelProviderChangedEvents to trigger label updates for elements that derive their labels from other related elements, when those related elements are changed.

I'm not entirely happy with this solution, but it does address a couple of issues with the approach I would rather have taken, which is having individual label providers listen for model changes themselves:  * the providers registered with the Label Provider Service aren't initialized with a    ResourceSet, ServicesRegistry, or other context in which they can find the    model to listen to  * providers could discover, as they are asked to provide labels, the objects they    need to listen to.

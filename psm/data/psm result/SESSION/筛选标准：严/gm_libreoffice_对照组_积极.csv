708,"Patch Set 1:It is the aforementioned Scottish Gaelic Spellchecker, prior LibreOffice versions were shipping with v2.8, but license file was missing, so the extension wasn't working.

I've placed this file in include/sfx2 because all .hxx files related to the template manager are there.It's not for filter combobox right now but will be used later in it's functionality. I'll use this file to recreate TemplateLocalView widget and maybe remove dependency on TemplateAbstractView by incorporating all changes to a new widget and inheriting directly from ThumbnailView as TemplateAbstractView gives folders type UI.

946,"Patch Set 3:Hi,I think you convert too much.When you add a method SdrGrafObj::getOriginalSize() it should return the size in the same units the SdrModel is defined in. This is not always 100thMM. In Draw/Impress/Calc it is, but in Writer it is Twips. So the method has to convert to the units of the SdrModel used, you can get that using GetModel()->GetScaleUnit() in/at the SdrObject which gives you the target MapUnit. Looks as if the original code you copied did not do that, but that is okay since it originally was only used in sd. With a method at SdrGrafObj it has to be done correct since e.g. it can be called in the future in Writer code and has to convert to Twips then.It is not needed to hand over the SdrObject again to the getOriginalSize() implementation as parameter, use the local C++ this ptr which is already the SdrGrafObj from which you need the size.In drviews7, the call to GetLogicRect() will already return the data in the model units, so I think the conversion there to 100thMM is not needed at all, just compare aRect.GetSize() with pSdrGrafObj->getOriginalSize, that should then compare both sizes in the same, correct model units.HTH!",3,5223,2016-04-20 15:29:07,2016-05-18 17:56:09,674,MERGED,4.0,44.0,4,5,5,positive,"Patch Set 3:Hi,I think you convert too much.When you add a method SdrGrafObj::getOriginalSize() it should return the size in the same units the SdrModel is defined in.

1341,"Patch Set 1:The problem in tdf#93124 is the following:1. The title text is aligned vertically to bottom, and its height is greater than its rectangle.2. In this case, when text isn't aligned to full width of the object, it ignores the vertical anchor setting (be it to middle or bottom), and aligns vertically to top. So, to retain correct position, the text must be aligned to full width.3. Full width alignment is only available when horisontal alignment is to center.4. All paragraphs in the text box are aligned to left, so LO ""optimizes"" the text object alignment to left bottom corner, thus disabling full width setting, and breaks the test position.Another approach could be to either allow full width for any horisontal alignment, or to fix incorrect anchoring in case when text height is greater than the rectangle (IMO, the latter is preferable). But that change is much more invasive, and I suppose that removing the optimization (lines 898-922 and 952-976) that uses word ""sensible"", i.e. it's not mandatory, just intended to be more performant (?) in some cases, may be more suitable here.Also, the line 1034 makes some kinds of text objects to auto-align its contents to the box.

1657,Patch Set 4:Hmm. That will most likely hurt us later but well we can deal with it then.I had chats with Kohei and Eike and I think the solution that seems to be acceptable to all of us is to use a std::vector<ScColumn*> or std::vector<std::unique_ptr<ScColumn>> with the additional requirement that there are no nullptr entries.This provides us with some benefits compared to the version without the additional requirement and the version based on std::vector<ScColumn>. We don't need to check every entry while iterating through columns (just compare once against std::vector::size) and we don't need to worry that pointers to ScColumn instances become invalid when we insert or remove a column.

3187,"Patch Set 8: Code-Review-1The import part looks good, and functions very well.  Great job on doing your analysis and coming up with a very well thought-out solution.Now, the only remaining issue is the saving.  Right now, when you open a csv.gz file, edits it, and hits Ctrl-S, it saves it back to the file uncompressed, while the extension is intact.  This is not ideal.I can think of 2 ways to resolve this.  The first way is to support saving it back gz compressed, by somehow storing the information that this file has been uncompressed and using that information and trigger gz compression on saving.  In this scenario, you need to be careful not to compress on save when the user decides to save the file with a different name.  There would be other corner cases you'd have to handle when going this route. Personally I don't like this solution.The 2nd way is to load the file read only when the file is automatically uncompressed during file detection.  This way, when the user wants to edit it and re-save it, she won't be able to overwrite the original file.  I personally like this solution.Here is the gotcha, though.  Forcing a read-only load is as easy as setting the read only flag to true with the media descriptor, which will prompt you that the document has been opened read only, and to edit it, the user will need to click ""Edit document"" to create a new document instance.  When you do that, Calc will still load the compressed stream into the 2nd document instance, not the uncompressed version.

Clearly the ScHorizontalAttrIter is used in a ton of places across the code-base, particularly in filters, and making it ~instant for all the common big-data cases is very helpful.The basic approach looks good too - the nMinNextEnd looks sensible to detect large runs of identical formatting.What doesn't convince me that much is the initialization and management of the pPrevColEnd array. It looks like that is not initialized initially [sic] ;-) and then there is an assumption that:                if ( bRepeatedRow )                    nCol = pPrevColEnd[nCol];-but- (AFAICS) there is no guarentee that pPrevColEnd[nCol] is setup correctly - it rather depends on the value of nCol that was used last time - which (in turn) depends on the shape of the data.So - I would suggest adopting a different approach for generating and managing that - along with some nicer data structure for this case.

Thanks!",1,20594,2013-11-08 14:10:34,2013-11-08 14:10:34,0,MERGED,1.0,1.0,2,3,3,positive,"Patch Set 1:Here is how I would do it:You want to make sure that a given XML element exists. You take the XPath of it, then:assertXPath(pXmlStyles, ""blabla"", 1);makes sure that there is exactly one node matching that XPath. If it was missing previously, that was 0.In the ooxmlexport suite, testStyleInheritance has plenty of such examples, also e.g. testBnc834035 shows how to assert an XPath in document.xml.Does that help? :-)Sorry for the nitpicking, but in the past I at least remember two cases already when we fixed hyperlink/redline/field end problems, so this is an area where we really want unit tests. Thanks!"

creates a function object that cannot be invoked if it is ""const"".the reason is quite obvious from the error so i won't waste space with explaining it and leave that as an exercise for the reader.i've run into this before and used lambdas in such cases, which oddly enough seem to work even with MSVC.the alternative is probably to patch boost::spirit to remove the ""const"" on the

We can always use the former, but I think later approach is better and cleaner way of doing things. We can sort-of know the order when the handlers would be called.

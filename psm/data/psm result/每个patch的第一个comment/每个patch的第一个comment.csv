11,Patch Set 4:I think this is a serious concern.  I hadn't thought of it before.We should look at how the platform console does this.  You can clone the platform console view and each new console will be filled with all the text.  Our TracingConsole class (gdb traces) does this by extending IOConsole.

Even paying attention to copyright statements.This change certainly cuts neatly through a bunch of unnecessary and wonky code.

That, combined with the fact that any clients trying to use these UI bits would have had to construct nonsense URIs, means that I don't mind that this technically is an API-breaking change because that API was already non-functional and it will have to break again some time anyways to support exporting to non-workspace destinations.

If you do as in the legacy tooling then I can't say that it will be hard to read. There is actually an aspect that you should not make the figure larger and that is the layout of legacy models. This is especially important for ports on capsule parts which should be 11x11 pixels large, disregarding if the stacking pattern is shown or not. The reason for the proposal to keep the stacking pattern on the inside is actually more about aligning with the layout of legacy models and size of ports there, see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=496304 for initial work related to this (but that one did not include the aspect of replicated ports, since we track that separately with https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=497825 and improvements in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=500982).",2,1064,2016/10/5 14:19,2016/10/5 8:17,2016/10/5 14:00,5,MERGED,4,63,3,9,3,1,1,-2

The menu item to enable this (""ÔÇªand show remaining projects in "") looks rather bizarre.

Thanks a lot!Page Engines  * In the Configuration group for tab Match is some padding to the right and hence makes the min width larger then needed.  * The description area has a slightly different background than the rest (on my Linux box using GTK2). It has the right background in the post processor page and the item providers page.Page Filters  * I'd decrease min width a bit  * The description area has a slightly different background than the rest (on my Linux box using GTK2). It has the right background in the post processor page and the item providers page.  * The label ""Automatic behavior"" is misleading. Firstly, this label doesn't really mean a lot. Maybe something like ""Remember selected group"" would be better. Secondly, this preference is independent from the selected group/filter, still it is on the same level as the Description group, which is dependent on the selection. Maybe we should put the description and the list of filters into a group?Page Groups  * Label at the top has a larger margin to the list below than on previous pages.  * Same last two as for filtersItem Providers  * To be consistent with other pages in EMF Compare (e.g. post processors), it'd be good to have a brief label at the top.

However, on the implementation side (the actual base index), the concerns are not truly orthogonal (e.g. if we have 'instance' indexing, we get stats and notifications practically for free), so there are only really these 5 modes of operation. The nontrivial part of the lattice logic must be provided somewhere (e.g. if matcher backend A requests instance and notification indexing, we do nothing when backend B later requests stats). So with a bit more work, we could probably have ├übel's service flags on the IQRC API, and the indexing level enum or something equivalent in the base index itself. Is it worth it?Also, what's the nicest way to provide the 'flags'? @Data class with three boolean fields? EnumSet for a three-valued enum representing the three services?

This is restricted at the compiler level.Our compiler settings don't enforce javadoc for default and private members, because those are necessarily invisible from outside their package.Tbh, I don't think it's a bad idea to put Javadoc on all classes, more information is always good.

I'm testing on GTK3.18 and it doesn't work, but when I test on 3.14 it does.

The difference is what the default is if the string is missing in the configuration.

In fact I think this will have the opposite behaviour in that skipGeneration will now explicitly be false and thus always generate it in the case of a missing value. At least that is the case if getBoolean returns a boolean (as opposed to a Boolean).

Then why was camel case also not set as suffix proposal?In a similar way, there could be some other existing type of proposal or one that could be implemented later, which may need to be handled similar to camelCaseMatch while validation.Hence, as I had suggested during code walk-through, I feel it would be better if you have the property as substringProposal instead of suffixProposal, which would be specific to your feature and will be set only for substring proposals.

Before that, please have a look at the following as well:- It is not working for type names, e.g. when you type a substring of a class name to declare a field.- The relevance / proposal order is mixed up when fields are proposed with types. Example:public class C {	int intField;	String stringField;	{		field|	}}- In case of methods, the substring is also matched in its parameters, return type, declaring type etc. I think it should be restricted to only the method name.- Filtering of the results still seems to have some issue. Not sure if the filtered results look confusing or non-relevant due to the above issue of not restricting the match to just the name or if it is due to the non-subsequent matching. We can check that once the above issue is fixed. Also, pattern highlighting in the proposal will be very useful with this feature. Please check if it is simple to implement.

745,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1(5 comments)Hi Jonah, great commit!  We would need some small changes, 1 necessary, others optional:1) Some script languages (like JS) do not support method overloading. So you cannot @wrap multiple methods with the same name. The last one wrapped will override the first one. You either need to find different names or wrap just one of those methods and use Object as an input parameter. Using instanceOf checks you might delegate calls to your original methods (which are not wrapped in this case). Your current contribution might still work in a lot of cases, but this is by pure chance and might cease to work in a future version of Rhino.2) as your module is stateless, you might use static methods only. This will allow me to call these methods without creating an instance of the module in the future3) We create dedicated inline documentation for modules. To link to other modules/wrapped methods use @module instead of @link. eg {@module #myMethod} (without signature).4) If you like you might also move your method directly to modules.platform as it would definitely fit there. Otherwise you need to check in project specific formatter and save actions as we did for the other projects.5) I especially like your usage of the completion provider.

It's the branch that always points to the latest release. The Git master branch does not have this semantic.Also my guess is that in most cases, when users want to convert their repository to Gitflow, it would make more sense to turn the existing master into develop (e.g. the EGit repository).",4,5398,2015/9/9 23:20,2015/8/28 21:44,2015/9/9 22:53,289,MERGED,10,386,3,6,6,0,3,-2

915,"Patch Set 3:I think the only other concern I has was exception handling. There are quite a few places where SnapshotException is caught, and it is either wrapped in a RuntimeException or reported as an error.In some cases we have to do one of those since the catching method cannot throw a checked exception, but we should make sure that the choice of throwing SnapshotException, wrapping in RuntimeException, or reporting the error is correct.In general, is the approach that ""user facing"" things like queries should report errors, but that ""code facing"" things like the collection extraction API should throw exceptions?There are some places where the existing query code catches SnapshotException and reports an error, but since the logic is now pushed inside the collection extraction API it throws a runtime exception and the query no longer catches it (e.g. CollectionFillRatioQuery). This means that previously there would be an error reported to the user but it would now lead to an uncaught RuntimeException.If we wanted to not wrap in RuntimeException, basically every method that does not implement an existing API would need to throw SnapshotException since implementing code may want to call another method that does.

The method name is isEditable(etc), and it is now returning 'true' when in fact it cannot be edited.

This makes sense because it is that service that knows if the data it uses can change.  Personally, I'd use a global array of ICoreInfo[] that gets filled once and then re-used. Don't forget to override flushCache() to also clear that cache (this is for a user operation where we just want to clear everything)",1,7025,2015/4/10 15:20,2015/4/8 16:42,2015/4/9 10:49,18,MERGED,3,236,3,8,3,0,3,-1

1020,"Patch Set 1:The reason why the read-only state of resources wasn't being cached at all in the scenario of showing the context menu in the Model Explorer is because the vast majority of accesses to the read-only manager were to query the read-only state of a resource directly, not indirectly via an EObject contained in the resource.  That was the only API that was cached before:  read-only state of a model element.So, the first major change in this patch is to additionally cache the read-only state of resources in the FSReadOnlyHandler, itself.  This was easily and safely done by a minor refactoring of the AbstractReadOnlyHandler to make the cache available to subclasses.However, this was not sufficient because the cache was actually always a no-op in the context-menu scenario.  The problem here is that caching was only active during the scope of a transaction in the read-only manager's editing domain.  However, the vast majority (if not all) of the read-only queries in the context-menu scenario are done without a transaction.  And even if they were done in a transaction, each and every one probably would have had its own transaction, nullifying any cache and probably making performance a bit worse by always setting up and tearing down the cache machinery.So, the second major change in this patch is to eliminate the cache's tie to transactions.  Now, the cache is implicitly initialized when read-only state is queried and is purged in an async exec (abstracted through an injected Executor).  This fixes the read-only part of the performance problems in the context menu.A bit of work was needed to fix the read-only JUnit tests, by injecting a custom executor that the tests can use to control when the cache is purged to force re-calculation of read-only state of resources as they change state.  Note that the read-only manager's makeWritable(...) API still *synchronously* purges the cache as before, so the make-writable use cases should still work (which is born out by the tests, actually).",1,7155,2015/4/1 1:06,2015/4/1 0:31,2015/4/1 0:40,0,MERGED,9,388,3,6,1,0,2,-1

Otherwise our automated builds would have detected this bug before.I guess the reason is that the pom.xml already contains the needed dependency. Yes, it's a shame that we have two parallel ways how we define dependencies.

1080,"Patch Set 1:None as far as I can see. The class (PathEnvironmentVariable) is private and only used to contribute to the PATH environment variable when cross-compiling.

It normally works fine, unless you use say ${ARM_TOOL_PATH} which java.io.File does not understand. It assumes ${ARM_TOOL_PATH} is some form of weird folder name in cwd and hence prepends c:\program files\...\eclipse\bin resulting in a non-existing directory being added to the path.

1131,"Patch Set 2:(1 comment)> ... the trace data and not its definitionYou are still thinking of ""fields"" and ""aspects"" as two different layers. They can be the same. We are not poking at bits directly here, everything is a ""definition"". It's just a matter of ""what we've implemented to put stuff in ITmfEventField's"" vs ""what we've implemented to put stuff in event aspects"".We could (and eventually should) create aspects programmatically for each field found in a CTF event. This will avoid for example having CTF fields and CTF contexts be both considered as the same thing, while they are slightly different (the context aspects can be defined per channel/trace, the field aspects per event type, etc.)> The user can create the filter without any trace being selected.What is the point of that?? And how can the user create filters with no trace opened if he has to go look for field names in another view, which will be empty because no trace is opened?We are building a graphical tool, we're supposed to make the user's life easier. Like, reading what's in the trace, and offering what can be selected. Not having to have the user read field names in another view then re-type them manually elsewhere. A prepopulated drop-down list would be much more useful than an empty text box here.Anyways, if you really feel that typing subfield names manually is such a desirable feature, I won't nak this. (One small comment though.) In a sense TmfEventFieldAspect is just a shim between the new aspect API and ITmfEventField. If we ever get rid of the latter, then TmfEventFieldAspect will be unneeded too.

Enabling/disabling the content provider when the menu state changes is a little bit more tricky. You'd probably have to use code similar to what's in org.eclipse.ui.internal.navigator.filters.CommonFilterSelectionDialog.okPressed().- I take the filtering change back - let's leave it unconnected.

It's not easy to depend on it. * Out of the box the new content provider should not be selected. Only when toggling via menu or by the user, it should get (de-) selected accordingly.* The toggle action should also toggle the content provider, otherwise there will be strange things in the UI when the user (accidentally) disables the content provider.I would hard-wire the action and the content provider, i.e. if the user disables the content provider I would toggle the action to 'Flat'.** -> I like those 3 proposals. However, I don't know I could implement a good RadioState based on content provider activation. Do you have an example of how to do this? Or will I have to use programatic menu contributions to deal with selection? * Same applies to the filters. Here I'd even vote to not surface them in the UI, and do the filtering directly in the content provider. Otherwise, you also have to enable/disable them when toggling the menu.** -> What do you mean by ""filtering directly in the content provider"". I don't think CNF content provider provide a good way to do that. Do you have an example? * The content provider does not react to changes: 'Import as Project' does not let the new project appear, and deleting a nested project does not bring it back as folder. I have to press 'F5' to get the view refreshed.** -> That's indeed an issue. This feature should place a few more workspace/resource listeners to trigger refresh on project creation/deletion. There are already some for some cases, I'll have a look at the reported scenario. * The state of nesting should be stored as dialog setting and not as preference. Maybe this can even be computed by the enabled state of the content provider.** -> ok for persisting it as dialog settings. However, I'd like to keep the preference as a default activation of nested view of projects, so RCP apps could enable this by default from the plugin_customization.ini.

This is important because the FilteringPaletteProvider is part of the public API (per Papyrus policy of having all publicly exposed component as part of the public API). This could induce false expectations from the user, especially if a custom user-defined provider does not support the way it is proxied.Indeed, the FilteringPaletteProvider have a peculiar way of using the proxied palette provider by resetting its contributions repeatedly (on line 260). This works for the DefaultPaletteProvider because we know the inner workings of this class, but this is not guaranteed to work on all IPaletteProvider. Note that relying on the knowledge of the inner workings of DefaultPaletteProvider is not a nice pattern ...Other mprovement track: Now that WalkerPaletteContributionHelper (in FilteringPaletteProvider.java) has non-static methods and uses instance fields, we could optimize its member (private) methods so that they do not instantiate a bunch of lists for nothing but all contribute to the same. We can do that by passing the resulting list as a parameter, or as an instance field.Side note regarding style: there are some trailing whitespaces in the contributed changes in FilteringPaletteProvider.java",1,8410,2014/11/4 7:29,2014/11/3 13:48,2014/11/3 13:48,0,MERGED,3,92,3,6,3,1,2,-2

1244,"Patch Set 2:(5 comments)Undo/redo works well.  Thanks!  It looks odd, though, that undo/redo changes the selection in the Model Explorer even when focus is currently in a diagram editor.  Especially if I have ""link with editor"" turned on in the explorer because in that case, the linking of the selection doesn't actually happen (which is a good thing, but looks like a bug).  I would expect the changed selection on undo/redo to be reflected in the diagram, but it isn't.  It's only selection changes caused by mouse or keyboard in the explorer view that are propagated to the diagram.Anyways, that can all be avoided simply by having the RevealResultCommand do its thing only if its view part is currently active.  That's actually better than what I suggested last time (I suggested then that the command should operate on whatever is the current view, but that would be bad, because that view may provide IRevealSemanticElement but not be the explorer, which would be confusing at best).",2,8433,2014/11/4 18:37,2014/10/30 10:50,2014/11/4 15:49,124,MERGED,13,764,2,3,3,0,3,-2

So, the idea of the command wrapper is neat.However, the command-wrapper would be more reusable/safe if it didn't explicitly look for the Model Explorer view (maybe there are multiple instances of it!) but instead checked that the currently active view provides the IRevealSemanticElement protocol.  Also, it should account for selecting the object(s) affected by undo and redo.  In the case of redo, that's the same as execute, but in the case of undo, the affected object should be the one that the new object had been created in.Also, why select-reveal only the first result?  If multiple objects were created, I would expect all of them to be selected.

Not sure whether I broke some things, but there's at least one *bug*: If I create a new snippet (Either through the ""Create Snippet"" context menu or through ""Add"" in the Snippets view) the snippet doesn't start out as needing to be saved (the little * symbol).Aside from that, I still have the feeling that we use two framework (FormEditor and data-bindings) to do the same thing.

1378,"Patch Set 1:There are three groups of changes in this change-set:(a) update the Properties View implementation to reuse the same SWT controls    for its tabs when the selection changes to another single or multiple    selection presenting the same Views (according to the property-sheet model).    This is a ""compatible"" selection	(b) update the DataSource and ModelElement APIs that provide the source of    data bindings in the Properties View to allow a compatible selection to be    injected into the SWT controls already showing	(c) implementation of delegating observables that support the ModelElements'    dynamic updating of their data-binding sources	Part (a) is largely just a matter of updating the DefaultDisplayEngine to detect that the set of Views it asked to provide tab-descriptors for is the same as the set of Views for which it last provided tabs.  In this case, the existing tabs and all of their controls are re-used and the new selection is pushed into the DataSource that is currently feeding these controls.  Hopefully, the infrastructural changes in parts (b) and (c) that make this possible will allow us to further refine the re-use of controls such that any View will only be created once and can be swapped in and out of tabs using PageBooks.Part (b) updates the DataSource to support replacement of its selection.  On injection of a new selection, a notification is broadcast to announce the change and ModelElements listening to the DataSource update themselves to pick up the new selection.  This entails to fundamental changes in the way that ModelElements work:  (i) the ModelElementFactory now tells a newly created ModelElement which      factory created it, so that the ModelElement can delegate to that factory the      update for a new selection.  This is necessary because it is the factory that      knew how to unpack from the selection what the ModelElement needs when      creating the  element, so it is the best able to update the element later.  All      of the various ModelElementFactory implementations add this new capability      to update an existing element with a new selection	    (ii) when a ModelElement creates an IObservable for one of its properties, it      now wraps that observable in a new delegator pattern.  The delegator is      what ends up ultimately being bound to SWT controls.  To ensure that we      don't have to rebuild those bindings every time the selection changes      (which would entail considerable API churn to make accessible after the      fact), these observable delegators allow their delegates to be replaced at      any time (assuming that the replacement is the same kind of observable,      based on the ""compatible selection"").  Replacing the delegate fires the      usual observable change event, which updates the UI accordingly via the      bindings.	  Part (c) is the implementation of the delegating observables.  They ensure that the entire contract of the underlying observable is provided (including all custom interfaces such as ICommitListener) via the dynamic proxy class mechanism.  The usual contract of observables is implemented, including tracking the invocation of getter methods, all verified with a fairly comprehensive suite of JUnits tests.",1,9145,2014/5/26 20:04,2014/5/23 2:44,2014/5/26 19:58,89,MERGED,70,3980,2,4,6,0,2,-1
1379,"Patch Set 3:Patch set 3 updates the DefaultDisplayEngine to re-use SWT controls on a per-tab basis, for tabs that present the same controls for the new selection as for the previous selection.  The equivalence of the contents of a tab is determined by new equals() semantics (and accompanying hash codes, of course) for XWTSectionDescriptors and XWTTabDescriptors.  Essentially, two XWTTabDescriptors are equal (and therefore would generate the same SWT controls) if their IDs are equal and their ordered lists of section descriptors are equal.With this change, the continuity of the property sheet UI is a bit better for the user:  when changing the selection, if the new selection presents the same tab with the same widgets as the currently active tab, then that tab just shows the newly selected element.  So, for example, once the user activates the Profile tab of an element to work with applied stereotypes, that tab seamlessly updates when selecting another shape in the diagram or another element in the Model Explorer (even going back-and-forth between diagram and explorer, where selections are GEF EditParts in the one case and facet tree-elements wrapping semantic model elements in the other).  There is no flashing of the UI as controls are destroyed and re-built to look as they did before.This new patch set also fixes a problem in the delegating observables, in the case that the delegate is a delegating observable implemented as a dynamic proxy (new test cases added to cover this scenario).  This problem was uncovered in testing the customization of property-sheet models (the binding of the observable list for view constraints blew up).  The ""Customization preview"" [sic] view seems to work correctly, although I don't know what special cases there are to exercise in this view.",3,9145,2014/6/10 18:17,2014/5/23 2:44,2014/6/10 17:41,446,MERGED,74,4208,3,6,6,1,2,-3
1380,"Patch Set 4:Patch Set 4 fixes the two problems observed by Camille.  Firstly, and more simply, the problem of the General tab going blank.  The problem here was that the Tabbed Property Sheet would disposed of an entire tab and its contents if the new selection didn't need that tab at all, without any interaction with the XWT-based DisplayEngine.  So, the DefaultDisplayEngine would continue to try to show disposed controls for the General tab (or any other in the same situation).  Now the DefaultDisplayEngine listens for the disposal of the controls that it creates and cleans up its understanding of which reusable controls are still available for which sections in which tabs.The exceptions in multiple-selection scenarios all boiled down to observables being prematurely disposed, either by the composite MultipleObservableValue, or by a DelegatingObservable, or by a ModelElement.  So, now all of these various components that can aggregate/share observables participate in a simple reference-counting scheme so that observables will only be disposed (and will be disposed automatically) when they are no longer in use by any component.",4,9145,2014/7/4 19:11,2014/5/23 2:44,2014/7/4 18:58,1024,MERGED,83,4866,2,4,6,1,1,-2

Not all results may have been displayed.)The filter can still search while the index job is running.  It starts a search job.  Clearing the cache cancels that job.  The search finds all items by default without typing, so it was most likely running when you cleared the cache.

It should only happen on first use.  The provider chooses to to initialize, and the GUI has no idea this is even taking place.  The current filter/provider mechanism has no callbacks regarding initialization (only a clear cache method).

Can you apply ""Patch to apply after this contribution gets accepted"" to your contribution?  I know that I originally said I'd handle that part, but that was because we were trying to squeeze things into Juno; since we missed Juno, we should do this right, and have the final solution ready before it is committed.- Lets add two new methods to IGDBHardwareAndOS.java (with javadoc):   void getResourceTypes(IDMContext dmc, DataRequestMonitor<String[]> rm);   void getResources(IDMContext dmc, String type, DataRequestMonitor<String[]> rm);- Implement those two methods in GDBHardwareAndOS.java to fetch the list of available resources (-info os), and to get the actual resource information for a specified type (-info-os <type>).  Then you can use that service to fetch the data, instead of sending MI commands directly from the view.- The current implementation is specific to a Linux target with a pre-defined set of resource type.  It would be better to ask GDB what the resources are and base the possible table content on that (using 'info-os' without any parameters).  This would not only allow us to handle any new resources added to GDB, but also different targets (Windows, different Linux, etc)  As the names returned by GDB are not so great ('smh' for example), I think we can keep using the name mapping you define in ResourceClassContributionItem, however, if a resource is not defined in that class we would then use whatever name GDB has sent.  I think this solution will not only be future-proof, but will simplify the implementation.- Please make sure there are no warnings in the new code - Say the view is displaying a resource type, it has the view menu showing.  If I select the 'gdb' node in the debug view (or the launch node, or unselect everything), the view menu disappers.  That is ok.  However, when I select a valid node in the debug view, the menu does not appear again, until I press refresh.- I think having a column waaaaaay on the right hand-side will cause the user to not notice that column.  This happens for Kernel modules.  Can we re-order the colums to have the big column the last one on the right?  Or can we make thatbig column less wide?- Have we already discussed that when selecting a new resource type, the view would not refresh automatically if it is empty?  I don't remember why we would have chosenthat option.  It does not seem user-friendly.- We will need to disable the view when using a session where GDB is too old. By using the IGDBHardwareAndOS service, fixing this will be easy, by simply having the service return an empty list of resources for older GDBs.  This will require a GDBHardwareAndOS_7_5 version of the service to ask GDB for -info-os, while the previous version simply returns an empty list.",1,9709,2012/5/25 17:43,2012/5/5 8:54,2012/5/5 9:00,0,MERGED,12,1337,2,2,9,1,2,-2

1505,"Patch Set 1:I have pushed a Gerrit review with further changes:https://git.eclipse.org/r/26695This integrates the SysML tests into the main ""Papyrus ALL Tests"" suite in the place in the sequence where they were formerly, before they were split off into a separate execution.  A system property supports excluding these tests.A new ""Papyrus Core Tests (no SysML)"" launch configuration runs this test suite as it was before, excluding the SysML tests, using that new system property.The ""Papyrus SysML Tests"" launch configuration still launches the SysML tests only.All three of the launch configurations now configure the HotSpot JVM thus:  - max 768 MB of object heap.  This lets the tests run comfortably but    still ensures that if memory leaking regresses dramatically, we may    find out via OutOfMemoryError in test execution  - tune the garbage collector to more aggressively evict soft reference    caches than it would by default.  The Common Navigator Framework    retains everything ever shown in a tree via soft references, which    makes it difficult to see whether memory is leaking when observing    the tests under a profiler.  This also, hopefully, makes the GC    overhead a bit smoother when executing the tests with a constrained    heap limitFinally, the Ant script that runs the tests in the build is updated to remove the separate execution of the SysML tests, because these are now integrated.",1,9720,2014/5/15 20:39,2014/5/15 19:43,2014/5/15 20:28,0,MERGED,5,249,3,7,1,1,2,-4

1515,"Patch Set 6: Code-Review+1OK.  So, I determined that the problem with Patch Set #5 was interaction between UML2 and CDO.  The root cause was that computing cross-references ""intrinsically"" using eCrossReferences() triggered the CacheAdapter in a UML Property element, which uses the inverse cross-referencing capability to compute NamedElement::clientDependency (which used to be persistent in UML 2.4 but now isn't in UML 2.5).  This also triggered loading of objects from the CDO repository.The end result was that a Diagram in a *.notation resource, still only partially loaded from the repository (it didn't have its contained objects, yet) had the CacheAdapter attached and the CacheAdapter didn't find any contents or cross-references because the Diagram hadn't finished loading.  Later, when the Diagram's CDOLegacyAdapter got around to finishing loading, the CacheAdapter was unaware of new contained objects (Shapes in the persistedChildren containment reference) being added, because they are added without notifications (the assumption being that nothing needs to be notified because the object doesn't properly exist, yet; a reasonable assumption under normal circumstances).  Therefore, the CacheAdapter is never propagated to the rest of the contents of the diagram, so any code that needs to find diagram views of UML model elements doesn't find them, and Papyrus on CDO is basically broken.Patch Set #6 fixes this problem by reverting to the original design of the ECrossReferenceAdapter's getCrossReferences() method, which computes the cross-references ""extrinsically"".  To fix the memory leak (this bug) I override useIsSet() in the feature-iterator to basically re-implement the special case of eCrossReferences() from ENamedElementImpl.  It's unfortunate that this hard-codes an Ecore special case, but I don't have a better fix that doesn't break some already established clients.  Note that there isn't any feasible change that I could make in CDO to help adapters like the ECrossReferenceAdapter in the object-loading procedure, and UML isn't the only model out there that uses the CacheAdapter (UML2 SDK offers CacheAdapter as a genmodel extension for any model that it generates to use).",6,9817,2014/4/30 22:15,2014/4/17 16:51,2014/4/30 21:52,317,MERGED,4,218,3,6,8,1,2,-2
1516,"Patch Set 7: Code-Review+1This integrates the new cross-reference iterator filtering mechanism into the ECrossReferenceAdapter.  For models that already have more highly customized cross-reference list iterators that do not extend the EContentsEList::FeatureIteratorImpl (and thus do not implement the new Filterable interface), the cross-referencer provides the same external filtering as in Patch Set 5.  This does result in derived references being computed by the underlying iterator, but it should be an exceedingly rare case.The JUnit tests are significantly overhauled, using now a generated model with some hand-written instrumentation for test assertions:  * added assertions that derived features are not computed    when the cross-referencer uses the intrinsic filtering    capability of the cross-references iterator  * added assertions that derived features *are* calculated    when the model provides a non=Filterable cross-reference    iterator  * the tests still assert proper resolving/non-resolving    behaviour of the cross-referencer, but now also for    both of the Filterable and non-Filterable iterator    casesThis new patch set does not cause any problems for Papyrus's UML modelling with CDO repositories.",7,9817,2014/5/1 16:02,2014/4/17 16:51,2014/5/1 15:50,334,MERGED,18,2222,3,5,8,1,1,-2

1554,"Patch Set 4:Thanks for giving this a look-over Daniel.  I introduced a new interface for a few reasons.First, I didn't want to filter getChildNodes() directly so as to maintain the original DOM.  The interface instead allows navigators of the DOM, such as the CSSEngine, to decide to use visibility as a shortcut.  This is useful for the CSS Spy.Second, a developer should be able to query the CSSEngine for the computed styles of an invisible widget.  I'm not sure that it's explicitly stated, but it would seem to be a reasonable expectation that if P = parent of C, then C should be a child of P.Third, I thought it might be a better pattern than cause CSSStylableElement to implement a getVisibleChildNodes(), and implement a default in ElementAdapter.  We may well have other document models that don't have a concept of visibility.I initially tried implementing this as providing an isVisible(child) method to act as a filter, but abandoned it as implementing isVisible() is particularly complicated on CTabFolder.  A CTF's children includes internal Composites and ToolBars that we can't reach programmatically, and so we can't determine their purpose.  Some of the composites exist to hold the CTabItem contents, but we can't tell which CTI.  So CTabFolderElement#getVisibleChildNodes() returns the CTabItem's control instead (perhaps it should walk and add the parents until it reaches the CTF too).  You'll also notice that getVisibleChildNodes() also returns all the CTabItem instances as they represent the tab information and they need to be exposed for tab-item properties.  Trying to shoehorn all of this into isVisible() was painful.",4,9931,2014/4/14 18:54,2014/4/10 18:19,2014/4/14 8:38,86,MERGED,8,214,4,9,5,1,2,-4

If an ICPPASTAttributeSpecifier is encountered there, it is expected to be a C++11 attribute. The previous implementation of attributes is a bit limiting regarding the capabilities required by C++11 attributes (scope and multiple attributes in one specifier).I also thought about a solution which introduces an attribute specifier for GCC attributes, but that would break the current API.

1630,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1Hi,thanks for contributing via Gerrit. I know about the contribution in the ticket itself, but I didn't had time to dig into this in more detail.Some things about your contribution:1. It seems you have the trailing whitespace issue. Looking at the ScrollBarHandlerTemplate there seem to be more changes marked as there are really. Could you please try to solve that so checking the changes is easier?2. This change may break backwards compatibility in case the ActiveCellEditorRegistry was used outside NatTable to perform modifications inside. Like exchanging the data or deleting a current selected value (e.g. https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=425176)Although the intention about the change is correct, I would like to keep the AbstractCellEditorRegistry for backwards compatibility. But it should be marked as deprecated, pointing to the new instance and telling about the issue when using it further. So users who will update won't get compile errors immediatelly.3. ScrollBarHandlerTemplateAlthough I'm not quite sure how to solve it better, I don't like the solution so far. The first thing is the instanceof check that seems to be not necessary. I thought you wanted to get rid of it?The second thing is that this change might not be compatible with the split viewport feature that was added lately. If you check the _703_HorizontalSplitViewportExample you will see that the sliders will be created by using the parent composite of the NatTable instance and are then added later on. So in case of split viewports, your change will break functionality.",1,10320,2014/1/21 9:23,2014/1/13 13:15,2014/1/20 22:46,177,MERGED,11,656,2,3,8,1,1,-2

1632,"Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1(1 comment)Hi,thanks for the contribution. But it has some things you need to fix/add.1. Trailing white spaces. You need to ensure that there are no trailing whitespaces. You can configure that in git config, so that is handled automatically.2. I think there are some issues in SizeConfig. On getSize() you always calculate percentage sizes. But that call should only be performed if percentage sizing is enabled. Why did you remove that check?Also you forgot to invalidate your aggregate cache when calling setSize(). Currently you are only doing this on setDefaultSize() and setPercentageSize().3. I would also like to see test cases for your changes. With changing the aggregate calculation for caching you are changing quite a basic logic. This needs to be tested well.

1748,"Patch Set 2:> This is by design. Merely changing null.unboxInt() to return 0 instead of -1 will break MANY things only in the state system (like stack attributes, off the top of my head). And that's without talking about views.There's a few things broken as it is now:- You can't get a -1 Int value from the factory method but you can get one using incrementAttribute() on a -2 Int value- Calling incrementAttribute() on this -1 Int value skips 0 and goes to 1.- The State System Explorer view cannot display a factory-made -1 Int value (as it is nullValue), it shows a blank value.If there is any code that is using the unboxed value of nullValue to check for null, that is badly designed code because it cannot differentiate with a real Int of that same value, it should use isNull(). I believe it's better to bite the bullet and correct that code now. Hopefully all of it is fixed by the patch now.Mathematically, I think it makes more sense to use zero as the null value's numerical value.> This is also by design. If we start to allow unboxing from one type to another, people might stop caring about what the actual type is, and always unbox their things into longs for example, doing costly casts over and over.It's a point to consider, but I prefer to give the benefit of the doubt and the flexibility to the designers. In the code I'm doing now, I have to do floating point mathematical operations on a list of state values that can be a mix of Int, Long, Double or nullValue. Using unboxDouble() gives much cleaner code than having a if-else or switch statement on the value Type to figure out the correct unboxing method.The unit tests should be correct now. The LTTng kernel state system creates a Threads/-1 attribute because the first events arrive before the Current_thread attribute has any value set. I considered updating the expected test state system with these events using the Threads/0 attribute (due to the current thread nullValue's int value), but decided against it because it would still be incorrect to consider that these events occurred in the swapper (0) thread. So the nullValue current thread continues uses the -1 attribute for the 'unknown' thread.",2,10842,2013/9/13 20:17,2013/9/12 22:00,2013/9/13 19:47,21,MERGED,7,51,3,6,6,0,3,-2

The class has two responsibilities of that class and I would say that adding the configuration logic of the ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService would make it worse.Also I would like to mention an other point: At the moment as user of the API you can get injected a ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService or/and a ProjectCoordinateProvider as well. The ProjectCoordinateProvider access the ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService inclusive the cache logic. The ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService access the advisors directly. I think this looks a little bit confusing and inconsistent.I mentioned that because I thought about a solution to fix both:What do you think about create a wrapper for ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService which take care of the configuration AND the cache (DependencyInfo --> Pc) logic?The ProjectCoordinateProvider will still have the other cache and would use the wrapped ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService.I think we would get a better separation and could get rid of the inconsistens by using ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService without cache and ProjectCoordinateProvider with cache both.,1,10861,2013/11/22 13:02,2013/11/20 14:57,2013/11/20 14:57,0,MERGED,5,118,3,9,3,1,2,-3

Please let me know what you think about it.Currently, there is no means to trigger the export command handler. I would suggest to add this to the TmfEventsTable Pop-up menu.Here how you could call the command handler in the method createPopupMenu() of the TmfEventsTable programmatically:final IAction exportToTextAction = new Action(""ExportToText"") {            @Override            public void run() {                IWorkbenchPage activePage = PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getActiveWorkbenchWindow().getActivePage();                IHandlerService handlerService = (IHandlerService) activePage.getActiveEditor().getSite().getService(IHandlerService.class);handlerService.executeCommand(""org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.exportToText"", null);            }        };tablePopupMenu.add(exportToTextAction);-------I also would like to ask you to change the format of the text file to match the columns in the table and instead of a hard-coded order of columns (which are actually the default TMF table columns). This you can achieve using methods extractFieldItems() of TmfEventsTable and getColumns() of the TmfVirtualTable instance which is a member of TmfEventsTable.

I can't rememeber the exact issue, but because of simplifications in the API, we can no longer infer the generics in the same way we used to. So rather than reengineer that for no gain, the simplest thing to do is just do waay with the generics since they aren't used anywhere. > Also, some changes in RemoteEmfConsumer, like the new notifyObservers method,> look like refactoring to me.

That would make> the fix much smaller and easier to review.The refactorings are realy part and parcel of the change, and believe it or not, they're pretty minimalized.

2089,Patch Set 5: (8 inline comments)On a high level this looks like a good change. I have voted -2 though since we must not add a dependency on a specific team provider (jgit in this case) to the review framework. I also agree with Miles that passing the repository along through the call chain isn't optimal. I would suggest that we discuss on the bug how to resolve the design issues.A few other things:* @version should be removed. We don't use them in Mylyn since it's easy enough to obtain that from the SCM and they tend to cause weird merge conflicts.* All changed files should have a corresponding copyright note under Contributors in the copyright header section.

2091,"Patch Set 8:The code was adapted to work with the new Remotes API that was just merged in.  Basically the functionality is as before and is tested (except for comparing review items which I could not test due to new bug 403389).There is one part missing to resolve the File Revisions when opening a file from the Review Navigator.  Miles I will need your help for this one, see the TODO comments in OpenCompareEditorProvider#init.Right now I use the ReviewBehavior object to pass in the parent repository needed to resolve the file revision from the team repository and the resolution is done when the file is opened in the compare editor.  Ideally, we should add a reference to the repository in the ReviewItemSet model element and a team IFileRevision reference in the Mylyn Review IFileRevision.  This would enable use to decorate the IFileItem icon in the GErrit Task editor and Review Navigator at all times.  However, to make that work, we need a way to detect that the workspace file has changed to redo the resolution when the user changes his workspace (e.g. when checking out another git branch).  This should be investigated and done as part of the effort for bug 371428, which is the evolution of the solution provided here).We should also change the Mylyn Review IFileRevision element name to IFileVersion to avoid confusion with the team API element (see bug 403393)In any case, except for the OpenCompareEditorProvider problem, this is ready for the final review",8,11986,2013/3/14 20:40,2013/3/14 19:42,2013/3/14 19:42,0,MERGED,17,597,4,9,11,1,2,-2

It probably makes sense to split CPPEvaluation into two classes, one derived from another, with fTemplateDefinition in the derived class. EvalFixed would then be able to derive from a more light-weight superclass.Another change I would suggest is adding a constructor to all evaluations except EvalFixed that takes IASTNode pointOfDefinition parameter.

2223,"Patch Set 3:I find the framing of the tool descriptions very distracting and it isn't done elsewhere in other UI pages.  I suggest just using [] around them as you did before.The tool-tips are now actually special notes to the user and IMO should start with ""Note:"". The perf tool tip doesn't provide anything meaningful since all tools require installation.  I would prefer you say: ""Note: does not require set-up or special compilation"" which explains why we chose it as the default.Instead of ""Cache Using"" for cachegrind which is very awkward I would suggest: ""Cache Usage"" or ""Cache Reporting"".For Callgraph, say: ""Note: requires SystemTap to obtain data"" or something to that effect rather than talking about the SystemTap language.For the ones requiring compilation, I'm not sure whether to include the C/C++ qualifier or not.  They will require rewording if specifying a note: for example, gprof could be worded as:  ""Note: requires compilation of at least one C/C++ source file using ""-pg"" option."" possibly leaving out the C/C++ part which is implied by our tools (see next paragraph).This brings up an interesting issue.  Since our tools only support C/C++, should the Profiling preferences and Properties be under the C/C++ Preferences and Properties.  This should not be solved in this patch and would require a separate RFE or bug.For now, I would suggest adding something to the top Profiling page, which currently doesn't have anything on it, to indicate that the preferences are for tools using the Linux Tools profiling framework for C/C++ projects.  This will at least prevent any confusion.The Restore Defaults buttons on all the pages do not operate properly as they set the default to be the first item in any radio group.  It should restore the preferred provider.

2384,"Patch Set 10:Content can't change during reading. Or at least it shouldn't. The correct way to modify the config file is to write a new copy of it to config.lock, then atomically rename config.lock to config. Anyone who edits the file in place is just asking to corrupt the file, and/or confuse a concurrent reader.But since this code is opening the file and then later stats it to find the length to estimate the read, and these are both resolving the path down to the inode separately it is possible for the file to change in length if someone renames an updated version in between the two calls.This is low level enough, and used often enough by JGit, that I want it to robustly handle the file size changing when the lock file rename protocol was followed by a concurrent writer. Otherwise servers will fall over periodically when a concurrent writer races against a reader, and the reader will eventually get caught between the two path->inode translations.Go ask Sun why the felt it wasn't necessary to be able to determine the length of an open file from a FileInputStream using the fstat() system call.

However, this whole thing started out by some colleague (and me) being irritated by exactly such References. You do a Rebase, it finishes, and suddenly you have that ORIG_HEAD thing popping into your face from the HistoryView. Instead of the nice linear history you wanted to achieve by the Rebase, you suddenly have something looking very much like two branches....I think that turning the toggle into some Always/Unreferenced/Never switch would confuse the poor user too much. They would have some branch on a commit and no white label, but once the branch moves to the next commit, the white label would magically appear?So perhaps the solution to this could be to make the Additional Refs visible by default and put a button close to the ""Show All Branches"" button so that users can more easily suppress the Refs?

Let me know if you see any problems with it.The generator should now return all commits up to the specified depth, ignoring any that were part of commonBase.  But it will correctly start returning any commits below the boundary of a previous shallow checkout, and return all commits at the old boundary as UNINTERESTING so that the PackWriter can exclude the right things from the pack.  As far as I can tell, this is correct behavior in all cases.I couldn't do the SEEN thing like I was planning on doing, because uninteresting commits get the flag set on them as well (as part of markStart()), so sometimes it's already present on commits in our queue even though we haven't added all their parents yet.  I reworked the depth stuff a bit and added some comments, hopefully making it clear enough that the depth sorting accomplishes the same thing.I'm cautiously optimistic that this is getting pretty close.

Large binary objects are probably less frequently modified by the user in the working directory, so we're probably less likely to actually need this faster access.

We could parameterise that to the same function and delegate based on a switch (e.g. fillInFrom(FILE), fillInFrom(STREAM) and then code if( from==FILE)fillInFromFile() else (if from = STREAM) fillInFromStream() so we only need this implementation once. Or, we could pass in a class (FillInSource) and have that delegated to.Either way, I think the duplicate looping logic should be removed so that when there's a future error, we only do it once, and it can be detected appropriately (and means we only have one place to fix in the future).",1,13474,2010/7/3 7:47,2010/7/3 1:21,2010/7/3 1:21,0,MERGED,1,110,2,2,4,1,1,-2

Create a new interface org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.IRemoteConnection2. Provides an implementation of IRemoteConnection for local connections (org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.LocalConnection)3. Your RDTConnection goes to package org.eclipse.linuxtools.internal.rdt.proxy. It should implement the IRemoteConnection interface too.4. The method RDTConnection#getConnectionsName goes to org.eclipse.linuxtools.internal.rdt.proxy.RDTProxyManager. Perhaps it should return a list of IRemoteConnection instead of the connections name. Notice that RDTProxyManager has already a getConnection(uri) method5. Finally create a method in org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.RemoteProxyManager to return either LocalConnection or RDTConnection based upon the URI and/or IProject.Notice that org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch has already two classes about remote connection: RemoteConnection and RemoteConnectionException.

2832,"Patch Set 1:This is a new Gerrit review presenting a variation of change 38587 that fixes the problem of every regeneration of the tests producing code in a new random order, which I discussed on the Papyrus-Dev mailing list. This is accomplished primarily by a verbatim translation of the QVTo transformation steps to Xtend language.  The overall design of the transformation pipeline is the same as before:  in particular, the UML models are the same.  It's just the language in which the transformations are specified that has been changed.Xtend exposes list values in UML models in their native EList terms, which affords stable and predictable ordering of transformation operations and, hence, test model structure and generated code.  It also provides for more concise, debuggable, searchable, and performant transformations with better Java integration.  On the subject of performance:  a comparison of the QVTo version against the equivalent Xtend version, averaged over 5 runs after a couple of warm-ups with the longest run discarded finds that the Xtend version runs more than twice as fast:  49.75 seconds as compared to 117.25 seconds.  This is including the M2T code-generation step that is the same Xtend in both cases and XMI identifier generation which is unique to the Xtend implementation of the UML transformations.  But, to me this is a bonus, not the important factor:  it's the tooling support and stability of the transformation that are most significant.A new UMLWriter workflow component is employed to assign predictable, stable XMI identifiers to elements of generated UML models to avoid unnecessary diffs in source control when re-generating.  (somewhat moot now that the models are no longer in git)This patch set also regenerates the test code from the Xtend version of the framework. I have git-ignored the generated UTP source models because they reference and depend on UML instance models of the GMFGens that are already git-ignored, so there's no point in having these in git.  Besides that they are now much larger because of the generated unique XMI IDs.I welcome any feed-back you may have on the question of whether we should adopt this Xtend-based transformation or continue with the QVTo implementation.  I do want to continue adding more synchronization test cases to complete the coverage of that new capability, so it would be nice to do that only in one or the other variant of the test framework.  ;-)",1,14589,2015/4/14 21:21,2014/12/10 13:52,2015/4/14 21:13,3007,ABANDONED,524,186169,2,5,6,1,2,-2

If this was done to give dirty editors chance to save their content - this doesn't work either, because first of all user denied once that he won't save it and second because the editor immediately recognize that resource is gone and simply stops to render the content and shows ""file does not exist"" error.The good news: with https://git.eclipse.org/r/41675 patch dirty editors of closed project will be closed too.Not so good news: this works only for projects closed with the ""standard"" CloseResourceAction - all other ""closing"" possibilities (custom actions or direct API use) will still not close the editor.So I think this change still makes sense.",3,14765,2015/2/12 19:27,2015/2/10 21:46,2015/2/11 5:54,8,ABANDONED,1,7,4,8,3,0,3,-2

So you would add this open source module to your build.However you don't want to run the open source test cases as they would fail in the custom environment but you still want to execute the extended version so you don't want to skip al tests either.So the option is to simple skip the test cases for the tests.dsf.gdb bundle and leave it on for other tests bundles.

It is better to set it to null when being declared, and add a else clause to the next if statement (and it is also better to use a static string rather than a local created one, and even better with internationalization ;-))-- NamedElement#getName() can return null, so this line can lead to NPE: textToEdit = messageToEdit.getName().trim();",1,14975,2014/5/28 13:04,2014/5/26 16:11,2014/5/27 7:15,15,ABANDONED,1,363,3,5,3,1,1,-2

2968,"Patch Set 1:A further change in how Model Explorer manages refresh, to avoid recalculating the entire tree structure on every model edit, which doesn't scale well on large models.First, the Model Explorer's resource-set listener now only schedules structural refreshes for the specific objects that notified changes.Second, the UMLLabelProvider fires LabelProviderChangedEvents to trigger label updates for elements that derive their labels from other related elements, when those related elements are changed.  This required a new mix-in interface for label providers in the Label Provider Service to allow Model Explorer and other clients to pass notifications to them on changes in the model.  I'm not entirely happy with this solution, but it does address a couple of issues with the approach I would rather have taken, which is having individual label providers listen for model changes themselves:  * the providers registered with the Label Provider Service aren't initialized with a    ResourceSet, ServicesRegistry, or other context in which they can find the    model to listen to  * providers could discover, as they are asked to provide labels, the objects they    need to listen to.  But should they be Adapters or ResourceSetListeners?  And    can we be sure that they won't leak, that the providers will be disposed at the    right time so that they can remove listeners/adapters?  * only the Model Explorer (for now) needs label providers to trigger updates.    Element-picker dialogs and other widgets in the Properties view, for example,    don't have this need, so this design ensures that the large number of other    UMLLabelProviders that are created (there are lots) don't all listen for model    changes    I am willing to explore this alternative further if reviewers agree that the new IDependentLabelProvider interface isn't a great thing.Another point that I'm not sure about is the changes in the SemanticUMLContentProvider to prevent addition/removal of stereotype applications from a resource triggering complete refresh of the Model Explorer.  I don't know in what contexts this might break some UI that depends on that refresh trigger.  The consequence of reverting the SemanticUMLContentProvider changes is only that applying/unapplying stereotypes results in a long lag in the UI on large models as the Model Explorer refreshes itself.

2969,"Patch Set 2:I've updated the change set to remove the IDependentLabelProvider that I didn't like.  Instead, now the UMLLabelProvider is a service that acts as a subordinate of the LabelProviderService.

When not installed as a service (which is also commonly the case), then none of this machinery is engaged.I like this better because it doesn't introduce new API and lets the label provider take care of its own concerns, which is as it should be.",2,15068,2014/8/28 22:49,2014/8/28 2:18,2014/8/28 22:44,20,ABANDONED,11,830,2,5,2,1,2,-2

3138,"Patch Set 1:The pack is normally closed when the last window to it is evicted from the WindowCache.This eviction occurs one of two ways:The first is by the weak LRU popping the least-recently-used window in order to release resources to keep the cache under the byte or open file limits. As these windows are popped the open window count on PackFile gets decreased, and the file is closed when the count drops to 0.The second is when WindowCache spins the ReferenceQueue. If the JVM GC killed some of our SoftReferences in order to free up heap memory WindowCache will (eventually) spin those now dead references out and decrement the open window count on the associated PackFile. When the count drops to 0, the file is closed.I just made a patch to C Git today that doesn't keep the file open if there is exactly 1 window on it. This might be useful in JGit too, but less so because the default window size is so much smaller (8 Kib in JGit).

3147,Patch Set 5:Now I have added the org.eclipse.egit.mylyn plugin. So you can see the full usage of the ICommitMessageProvider extension.Additionally feature I have added is the use of a project specific commit template. For this you must enter the project properties and add a template at Task Repository -> Commit Template.Andf -of cource - you must add a query in mylyn and activate a task :),5,15831,2010/12/22 15:18,2010/12/22 14:49,2010/12/22 14:49,0,ABANDONED,13,399,2,5,11,0,2,-1

3150,"Patch Set 1:A problem with @SupressWarning is that it is too coarse.This would be the first deprecated warning to suppress and I'm not convinced it is a good idea. We are programming for the 3.5 API and you will get different warnings depending on the Eclipse version you are running. This differs from other warnings, that do not depend on our Eclipse version. I.e. we know better what is hidden.The SupressWarning annotation should perhaps refer to the use of addDerived, because anyone looking at the code with Eclipse 3.5 will not understand the problem.

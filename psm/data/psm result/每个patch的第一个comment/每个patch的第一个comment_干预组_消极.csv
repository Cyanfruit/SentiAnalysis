Even paying attention to copyright statements.This change certainly cuts neatly through a bunch of unnecessary and wonky code.  I was going to complain that changing the APIs in the UI classes from working with URIs to working with IResources results in a loss of generality, so that it would be more difficult to support exporting diagrams to the host filesystem (which is desperately needed, IMO) or other destinations, and that IResource is not even as appropriate a type as IContainer, but then I observed that the entire export infrastructure beneath the UI is all pinned to the IResource contract, anyways.  That, combined with the fact that any clients trying to use these UI bits would have had to construct nonsense URIs, means that I don't mind that this technically is an API-breaking change because that API was already non-functional and it will have to break again some time anyways to support exporting to non-workspace destinations.

If you move around a port placing it on the four different borders, then the behavior adornment used to always be oriented ""inwards"", i.e. it re-orients whenever you move the port to a different border.

If you do as in the legacy tooling then I can't say that it will be hard to read. There is actually an aspect that you should not make the figure larger and that is the layout of legacy models. This is especially important for ports on capsule parts which should be 11x11 pixels large, disregarding if the stacking pattern is shown or not. The reason for the proposal to keep the stacking pattern on the inside is actually more about aligning with the layout of legacy models and size of ports there, see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=496304 for initial work related to this (but that one did not include the aspect of replicated ports, since we track that separately with https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=497825 and improvements in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=500982).",2,1064,2016/10/5 14:19,2016/10/5 8:17,2016/10/5 14:00,5,MERGED,4,63,3,9,3,negative,1,-2

My only real comments:I think we should align the text used to match the Package Explorer: so 'Other Projects', rather than 'Other'.I think the different placement of Other, as compared to the Package Explorer, makes sense: the user has chosen to emphasize working sets, so projects that aren't in a working set are different.  But it's worth soliciting feedback from the users who strongly wanted this feature back.I think we should *always* show other projects in the Other category.  The menu item to enable this (""ÔÇªand show remaining projects in "") looks rather bizarre.

This means that previously there would be an error reported to the user but it would now lead to an uncaught RuntimeException.If we wanted to not wrap in RuntimeException, basically every method that does not implement an existing API would need to throw SnapshotException since implementing code may want to call another method that does.

1164,"Patch Set 10: Verified-1- When you add a new package, you also have to add it to the manifest. I would name the package ""nested"" not ""nesting"", since you use the term ""nested"" at all other places.- The content provider name should be 'Nested Projects' (uppercase 'p')- I think you can set the radio state by using HandlerUtil.updateRadioState(event.getCommand(), VALUE); I think there is no API to listen to content provider enablement/disablement in the Customize dialog, but you can update the radio state when the content provider is created, and when it is disposed. Enabling/disabling the content provider when the menu state changes is a little bit more tricky. You'd probably have to use code similar to what's in org.eclipse.ui.internal.navigator.filters.CommonFilterSelectionDialog.okPressed().- I take the filtering change back - let's leave it unconnected. When we disable the Java content, we also keep the Java related filters (not optimal, but that's how it currently is).- Project Presentation: it should be in the same group as Package Presentation - we can leave this as is since we don't want to introduce a dependency on JDT.- dialog store vs. preference: if you want to set it via plugin_customization.ini, then I'm OK to use a preference - but not show it in the preferences dialog.",10,7883,2015/1/12 10:21,2014/12/12 10:11,2015/1/12 8:42,742,MERGED,11,1992,2,3,17,negative,2,-2

Please replace it everywhere with e.g. ""nesting"" or ""nested"", and move the classes into the 'org.eclipse.ui.internal.navigator.resources.workbench' package.* ""and others"" in the copyright needs a dot* the content provider should not contain ""show"" in the name, just ""Nested Projects""* Project Presentation: the label needs mnemonic - suggest to use 'r'* Project Presetion - the sub-menu labels also need mnemonic ('F' and 'P')** -> I used 'F' and 'H' Still TODOs with questions/comments: * Project Presentation: it should be in the same group as Package Presentation  -> The 'label' group is contributed programatically by JDT UI. It's not easy to depend on it. * Out of the box the new content provider should not be selected. Only when toggling via menu or by the user, it should get (de-) selected accordingly.* The toggle action should also toggle the content provider, otherwise there will be strange things in the UI when the user (accidentally) disables the content provider.I would hard-wire the action and the content provider, i.e. if the user disables the content provider I would toggle the action to 'Flat'.** -> I like those 3 proposals. However, I don't know I could implement a good RadioState based on content provider activation. Do you have an example of how to do this? Or will I have to use programatic menu contributions to deal with selection? * Same applies to the filters. Here I'd even vote to not surface them in the UI, and do the filtering directly in the content provider. Otherwise, you also have to enable/disable them when toggling the menu.** -> What do you mean by ""filtering directly in the content provider"". I don't think CNF content provider provide a good way to do that. Do you have an example? * The content provider does not react to changes: 'Import as Project' does not let the new project appear, and deleting a nested project does not bring it back as folder. I have to press 'F5' to get the view refreshed.** -> That's indeed an issue. This feature should place a few more workspace/resource listeners to trigger refresh on project creation/deletion. There are already some for some cases, I'll have a look at the reported scenario. * The state of nesting should be stored as dialog setting and not as preference. Maybe this can even be computed by the enabled state of the content provider.** -> ok for persisting it as dialog settings. However, I'd like to keep the preference as a default activation of nested view of projects, so RCP apps could enable this by default from the plugin_customization.ini.

This is important because the FilteringPaletteProvider is part of the public API (per Papyrus policy of having all publicly exposed component as part of the public API). This could induce false expectations from the user, especially if a custom user-defined provider does not support the way it is proxied.Indeed, the FilteringPaletteProvider have a peculiar way of using the proxied palette provider by resetting its contributions repeatedly (on line 260). This works for the DefaultPaletteProvider because we know the inner workings of this class, but this is not guaranteed to work on all IPaletteProvider. Note that relying on the knowledge of the inner workings of DefaultPaletteProvider is not a nice pattern ...Other mprovement track: Now that WalkerPaletteContributionHelper (in FilteringPaletteProvider.java) has non-static methods and uses instance fields, we could optimize its member (private) methods so that they do not instantiate a bunch of lists for nothing but all contribute to the same. We can do that by passing the resulting list as a parameter, or as an instance field.Side note regarding style: there are some trailing whitespaces in the contributed changes in FilteringPaletteProvider.java",1,8410,2014/11/4 7:29,2014/11/3 13:48,2014/11/3 13:48,0,MERGED,3,92,3,6,3,negative,2,-2

1379,"Patch Set 3:Patch set 3 updates the DefaultDisplayEngine to re-use SWT controls on a per-tab basis, for tabs that present the same controls for the new selection as for the previous selection.  The equivalence of the contents of a tab is determined by new equals() semantics (and accompanying hash codes, of course) for XWTSectionDescriptors and XWTTabDescriptors.  Essentially, two XWTTabDescriptors are equal (and therefore would generate the same SWT controls) if their IDs are equal and their ordered lists of section descriptors are equal.With this change, the continuity of the property sheet UI is a bit better for the user:  when changing the selection, if the new selection presents the same tab with the same widgets as the currently active tab, then that tab just shows the newly selected element.  So, for example, once the user activates the Profile tab of an element to work with applied stereotypes, that tab seamlessly updates when selecting another shape in the diagram or another element in the Model Explorer (even going back-and-forth between diagram and explorer, where selections are GEF EditParts in the one case and facet tree-elements wrapping semantic model elements in the other).  There is no flashing of the UI as controls are destroyed and re-built to look as they did before.This new patch set also fixes a problem in the delegating observables, in the case that the delegate is a delegating observable implemented as a dynamic proxy (new test cases added to cover this scenario).  This problem was uncovered in testing the customization of property-sheet models (the binding of the observable list for view constraints blew up).  The ""Customization preview"" [sic] view seems to work correctly, although I don't know what special cases there are to exercise in this view.",3,9145,2014/6/10 18:17,2014/5/23 2:44,2014/6/10 17:41,446,MERGED,74,4208,3,6,6,negative,2,-3
1380,"Patch Set 4:Patch Set 4 fixes the two problems observed by Camille.  Firstly, and more simply, the problem of the General tab going blank.  The problem here was that the Tabbed Property Sheet would disposed of an entire tab and its contents if the new selection didn't need that tab at all, without any interaction with the XWT-based DisplayEngine.  So, the DefaultDisplayEngine would continue to try to show disposed controls for the General tab (or any other in the same situation).  Now the DefaultDisplayEngine listens for the disposal of the controls that it creates and cleans up its understanding of which reusable controls are still available for which sections in which tabs.The exceptions in multiple-selection scenarios all boiled down to observables being prematurely disposed, either by the composite MultipleObservableValue, or by a DelegatingObservable, or by a ModelElement.  So, now all of these various components that can aggregate/share observables participate in a simple reference-counting scheme so that observables will only be disposed (and will be disposed automatically) when they are no longer in use by any component.",4,9145,2014/7/4 19:11,2014/5/23 2:44,2014/7/4 18:58,1024,MERGED,83,4866,2,4,6,negative,1,-2

1503,"Patch Set 1: (16 inline comments)Thanks for the patch.  Below are general comments, and the others are in-line.  I haven't looked in detail at all the files, because there are some relatively major changes that will cause modification to those files.I think we are quite close.  The comments may seem larger than they really are, and I believe it won't take too much effort to get this ready to commit.- I found myself writing comments that I then realized where already part of the patch I had attached to the bugzilla entry.  Can you apply ""Patch to apply after this contribution gets accepted"" to your contribution?  I know that I originally said I'd handle that part, but that was because we were trying to squeeze things into Juno; since we missed Juno, we should do this right, and have the final solution ready before it is committed.- Lets add two new methods to IGDBHardwareAndOS.java (with javadoc):   void getResourceTypes(IDMContext dmc, DataRequestMonitor<String[]> rm);   void getResources(IDMContext dmc, String type, DataRequestMonitor<String[]> rm);- Implement those two methods in GDBHardwareAndOS.java to fetch the list of available resources (-info os), and to get the actual resource information for a specified type (-info-os <type>).  Then you can use that service to fetch the data, instead of sending MI commands directly from the view.- The current implementation is specific to a Linux target with a pre-defined set of resource type.  It would be better to ask GDB what the resources are and base the possible table content on that (using 'info-os' without any parameters).  This would not only allow us to handle any new resources added to GDB, but also different targets (Windows, different Linux, etc)  As the names returned by GDB are not so great ('smh' for example), I think we can keep using the name mapping you define in ResourceClassContributionItem, however, if a resource is not defined in that class we would then use whatever name GDB has sent.  I think this solution will not only be future-proof, but will simplify the implementation.- Please make sure there are no warnings in the new code - Say the view is displaying a resource type, it has the view menu showing.  If I select the 'gdb' node in the debug view (or the launch node, or unselect everything), the view menu disappers.  That is ok.  However, when I select a valid node in the debug view, the menu does not appear again, until I press refresh.- I think having a column waaaaaay on the right hand-side will cause the user to not notice that column.  This happens for Kernel modules.  Can we re-order the colums to have the big column the last one on the right?  Or can we make thatbig column less wide?- Have we already discussed that when selecting a new resource type, the view would not refresh automatically if it is empty?  I don't remember why we would have chosenthat option.  It does not seem user-friendly.- We will need to disable the view when using a session where GDB is too old. By using the IGDBHardwareAndOS service, fixing this will be easy, by simply having the service return an empty list of resources for older GDBs.  This will require a GDBHardwareAndOS_7_5 version of the service to ask GDB for -info-os, while the previous version simply returns an empty list.",1,9709,2012/5/25 17:43,2012/5/5 8:54,2012/5/5 9:00,0,MERGED,12,1337,2,2,9,negative,2,-2

A system property supports excluding these tests.A new ""Papyrus Core Tests (no SysML)"" launch configuration runs this test suite as it was before, excluding the SysML tests, using that new system property.The ""Papyrus SysML Tests"" launch configuration still launches the SysML tests only.All three of the launch configurations now configure the HotSpot JVM thus:  - max 768 MB of object heap.  This lets the tests run comfortably but    still ensures that if memory leaking regresses dramatically, we may    find out via OutOfMemoryError in test execution  - tune the garbage collector to more aggressively evict soft reference    caches than it would by default.  The Common Navigator Framework    retains everything ever shown in a tree via soft references, which    makes it difficult to see whether memory is leaking when observing    the tests under a profiler.

1515,"Patch Set 6: Code-Review+1OK.  So, I determined that the problem with Patch Set #5 was interaction between UML2 and CDO.  The root cause was that computing cross-references ""intrinsically"" using eCrossReferences() triggered the CacheAdapter in a UML Property element, which uses the inverse cross-referencing capability to compute NamedElement::clientDependency (which used to be persistent in UML 2.4 but now isn't in UML 2.5).  This also triggered loading of objects from the CDO repository.The end result was that a Diagram in a *.notation resource, still only partially loaded from the repository (it didn't have its contained objects, yet) had the CacheAdapter attached and the CacheAdapter didn't find any contents or cross-references because the Diagram hadn't finished loading.  Later, when the Diagram's CDOLegacyAdapter got around to finishing loading, the CacheAdapter was unaware of new contained objects (Shapes in the persistedChildren containment reference) being added, because they are added without notifications (the assumption being that nothing needs to be notified because the object doesn't properly exist, yet; a reasonable assumption under normal circumstances).  Therefore, the CacheAdapter is never propagated to the rest of the contents of the diagram, so any code that needs to find diagram views of UML model elements doesn't find them, and Papyrus on CDO is basically broken.Patch Set #6 fixes this problem by reverting to the original design of the ECrossReferenceAdapter's getCrossReferences() method, which computes the cross-references ""extrinsically"".  To fix the memory leak (this bug) I override useIsSet() in the feature-iterator to basically re-implement the special case of eCrossReferences() from ENamedElementImpl.  It's unfortunate that this hard-codes an Ecore special case, but I don't have a better fix that doesn't break some already established clients.  Note that there isn't any feasible change that I could make in CDO to help adapters like the ECrossReferenceAdapter in the object-loading procedure, and UML isn't the only model out there that uses the CacheAdapter (UML2 SDK offers CacheAdapter as a genmodel extension for any model that it generates to use).",6,9817,2014/4/30 22:15,2014/4/17 16:51,2014/4/30 21:52,317,MERGED,4,218,3,6,8,negative,2,-2
1516,"Patch Set 7: Code-Review+1This integrates the new cross-reference iterator filtering mechanism into the ECrossReferenceAdapter.  For models that already have more highly customized cross-reference list iterators that do not extend the EContentsEList::FeatureIteratorImpl (and thus do not implement the new Filterable interface), the cross-referencer provides the same external filtering as in Patch Set 5.  This does result in derived references being computed by the underlying iterator, but it should be an exceedingly rare case.The JUnit tests are significantly overhauled, using now a generated model with some hand-written instrumentation for test assertions:  * added assertions that derived features are not computed    when the cross-referencer uses the intrinsic filtering    capability of the cross-references iterator  * added assertions that derived features *are* calculated    when the model provides a non=Filterable cross-reference    iterator  * the tests still assert proper resolving/non-resolving    behaviour of the cross-referencer, but now also for    both of the Filterable and non-Filterable iterator    casesThis new patch set does not cause any problems for Papyrus's UML modelling with CDO repositories.",7,9817,2014/5/1 16:02,2014/4/17 16:51,2014/5/1 15:50,334,MERGED,18,2222,3,5,8,negative,1,-2

1554,"Patch Set 4:Thanks for giving this a look-over Daniel.  I introduced a new interface for a few reasons.First, I didn't want to filter getChildNodes() directly so as to maintain the original DOM.  The interface instead allows navigators of the DOM, such as the CSSEngine, to decide to use visibility as a shortcut.  This is useful for the CSS Spy.Second, a developer should be able to query the CSSEngine for the computed styles of an invisible widget.  I'm not sure that it's explicitly stated, but it would seem to be a reasonable expectation that if P = parent of C, then C should be a child of P.Third, I thought it might be a better pattern than cause CSSStylableElement to implement a getVisibleChildNodes(), and implement a default in ElementAdapter.  We may well have other document models that don't have a concept of visibility.I initially tried implementing this as providing an isVisible(child) method to act as a filter, but abandoned it as implementing isVisible() is particularly complicated on CTabFolder.  A CTF's children includes internal Composites and ToolBars that we can't reach programmatically, and so we can't determine their purpose.  Some of the composites exist to hold the CTabItem contents, but we can't tell which CTI.

I know about the contribution in the ticket itself, but I didn't had time to dig into this in more detail.Some things about your contribution:1. It seems you have the trailing whitespace issue. Looking at the ScrollBarHandlerTemplate there seem to be more changes marked as there are really. Could you please try to solve that so checking the changes is easier?2. This change may break backwards compatibility in case the ActiveCellEditorRegistry was used outside NatTable to perform modifications inside. Like exchanging the data or deleting a current selected value (e.g. https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=425176)Although the intention about the change is correct, I would like to keep the AbstractCellEditorRegistry for backwards compatibility. But it should be marked as deprecated, pointing to the new instance and telling about the issue when using it further. So users who will update won't get compile errors immediatelly.3. ScrollBarHandlerTemplateAlthough I'm not quite sure how to solve it better, I don't like the solution so far. The first thing is the instanceof check that seems to be not necessary.

1754,Patch Set 1:@Andreas: I thought about and would say: yes and no ;-)The ProjectCoordinateProvider uses the ProjectCordinateAdvisorService and add the cache (DependencyInfo --> Pc) functionality. Until here it sounds like a wrapper. But it also provide the mapping between workspace artifacts and DependencyInfos. The class has two responsibilities of that class and I would say that adding the configuration logic of the ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService would make it worse.Also I would like to mention an other point: At the moment as user of the API you can get injected a ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService or/and a ProjectCoordinateProvider as well. The ProjectCoordinateProvider access the ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService inclusive the cache logic. The ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService access the advisors directly. I think this looks a little bit confusing and inconsistent.I mentioned that because I thought about a solution to fix both:What do you think about create a wrapper for ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService which take care of the configuration AND the cache (DependencyInfo --> Pc) logic?The ProjectCoordinateProvider will still have the other cache and would use the wrapped ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService.I think we would get a better separation and could get rid of the inconsistens by using ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService without cache and ProjectCoordinateProvider with cache both.,1,10861,2013/11/22 13:02,2013/11/20 14:57,2013/11/20 14:57,0,MERGED,5,118,3,9,3,negative,2,-3

I suggest just using [] around them as you did before.The tool-tips are now actually special notes to the user and IMO should start with ""Note:"". The perf tool tip doesn't provide anything meaningful since all tools require installation.  I would prefer you say: ""Note: does not require set-up or special compilation"" which explains why we chose it as the default.Instead of ""Cache Using"" for cachegrind which is very awkward I would suggest: ""Cache Usage"" or ""Cache Reporting"".For Callgraph, say: ""Note: requires SystemTap to obtain data"" or something to that effect rather than talking about the SystemTap language.For the ones requiring compilation, I'm not sure whether to include the C/C++ qualifier or not.  They will require rewording if specifying a note: for example, gprof could be worded as:  ""Note: requires compilation of at least one C/C++ source file using ""-pg"" option."" possibly leaving out the C/C++ part which is implied by our tools (see next paragraph).This brings up an interesting issue.  Since our tools only support C/C++, should the Profiling preferences and Properties be under the C/C++ Preferences and Properties.  This should not be solved in this patch and would require a separate RFE or bug.For now, I would suggest adding something to the top Profiling page, which currently doesn't have anything on it, to indicate that the preferences are for tools using the Linux Tools profiling framework for C/C++ projects.

The correct way to modify the config file is to write a new copy of it to config.lock, then atomically rename config.lock to config. Anyone who edits the file in place is just asking to corrupt the file, and/or confuse a concurrent reader.But since this code is opening the file and then later stats it to find the length to estimate the read, and these are both resolving the path down to the inode separately it is possible for the file to change in length if someone renames an updated version in between the two calls.This is low level enough, and used often enough by JGit, that I want it to robustly handle the file size changing when the lock file rename protocol was followed by a concurrent writer. Otherwise servers will fall over periodically when a concurrent writer races against a reader, and the reader will eventually get caught between the two path->inode translations.Go ask Sun why the felt it wasn't necessary to be able to determine the length of an open file from a FileInputStream using the fstat() system call.

However, this whole thing started out by some colleague (and me) being irritated by exactly such References. You do a Rebase, it finishes, and suddenly you have that ORIG_HEAD thing popping into your face from the HistoryView. Instead of the nice linear history you wanted to achieve by the Rebase, you suddenly have something looking very much like two branches....I think that turning the toggle into some Always/Unreferenced/Never switch would confuse the poor user too much. They would have some branch on a commit and no white label, but once the branch moves to the next commit, the white label would magically appear?So perhaps the solution to this could be to make the Additional Refs visible by default and put a button close to the ""Show All Branches"" button so that users can more easily suppress the Refs?

As far as I can tell, this is correct behavior in all cases.I couldn't do the SEEN thing like I was planning on doing, because uninteresting commits get the flag set on them as well (as part of markStart()), so sometimes it's already present on commits in our queue even though we haven't added all their parents yet.  I reworked the depth stuff a bit and added some comments, hopefully making it clear enough that the depth sorting accomplishes the same thing.I'm cautiously optimistic that this is getting pretty close.

We could parameterise that to the same function and delegate based on a switch (e.g. fillInFrom(FILE), fillInFrom(STREAM) and then code if( from==FILE)fillInFromFile() else (if from = STREAM) fillInFromStream() so we only need this implementation once. Or, we could pass in a class (FillInSource) and have that delegated to.Either way, I think the duplicate looping logic should be removed so that when there's a future error, we only do it once, and it can be detected appropriately (and means we only have one place to fix in the future).",1,13474,2010/7/3 7:47,2010/7/3 1:21,2010/7/3 1:21,0,MERGED,1,110,2,2,4,negative,1,-2

2778,Patch Set 1:This seem to hurt LT proxy design. I'm not certain how to handle this change too. So lets discuss some ideas.I think it should be designed as:1. Create a new interface org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.IRemoteConnection2. Provides an implementation of IRemoteConnection for local connections (org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.LocalConnection)3. Your RDTConnection goes to package org.eclipse.linuxtools.internal.rdt.proxy. It should implement the IRemoteConnection interface too.4. The method RDTConnection#getConnectionsName goes to org.eclipse.linuxtools.internal.rdt.proxy.RDTProxyManager. Perhaps it should return a list of IRemoteConnection instead of the connections name. Notice that RDTProxyManager has already a getConnection(uri) method5. Finally create a method in org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.RemoteProxyManager to return either LocalConnection or RDTConnection based upon the URI and/or IProject.Notice that org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch has already two classes about remote connection: RemoteConnection and RemoteConnectionException.

2814,"Patch Set 1:This change follows up (and depends on) review 54318.The GMF Notation model has a peculiar structure in the View::element reference, which is ""unsettable"" in the EMF feature sense of supporting a separate ""unset"" state and which has a default value that is derived from the element references of the parent view chain.To support AOF bindings and other operations on such references, the AOF needs to support this ""unset"" state explicitly.  As the EMF implementation of the AOF represents all scalar features as IOnes, and as the IOne interface already provides a default value, it seemed useful to add an ""isDefault"" API to IOne in order to let clients know when the box's value is defaulted.  The EMF implementation of the IOne for scalar features takes account of the unset state and exposes it in this new API.  The One class and its delegate likewise provide the default state for other domains.New JUnit tests are included for simple scenarios in the EMF domain and the core AOF.",1,14414,2015/8/26 3:52,2015/8/26 3:45,2015/8/26 3:45,0,ABANDONED,21,1177,3,5,2,negative,2,-2

However you could replace these tests cases with an extension of these test cases or a customized version based on this open source bundle.So when running your builds you want to know if the original  tests.dsf.gdb still compiles as you need to re-base you custom test cases at a later point. So you would add this open source module to your build.However you don't want to run the open source test cases as they would fail in the custom environment but you still want to execute the extended version so you don't want to skip al tests either.So the option is to simple skip the test cases for the tests.dsf.gdb bundle and leave it on for other tests bundles.

It is better to set it to null when being declared, and add a else clause to the next if statement (and it is also better to use a static string rather than a local created one, and even better with internationalization ;-))-- NamedElement#getName() can return null, so this line can lead to NPE: textToEdit = messageToEdit.getName().trim();",1,14975,2014/5/28 13:04,2014/5/26 16:11,2014/5/27 7:15,15,ABANDONED,1,363,3,5,3,negative,1,-2

As these windows are popped the open window count on PackFile gets decreased, and the file is closed when the count drops to 0.The second is when WindowCache spins the ReferenceQueue. If the JVM GC killed some of our SoftReferences in order to free up heap memory WindowCache will (eventually) spin those now dead references out and decrement the open window count on the associated PackFile. When the count drops to 0, the file is closed.I just made a patch to C Git today that doesn't keep the file open if there is exactly 1 window on it.

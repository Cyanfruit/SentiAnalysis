It has the right background in the post processor page and the item providers page.Page Filters  * I'd decrease min width a bit  * The description area has a slightly different background than the rest (on my Linux box using GTK2). It has the right background in the post processor page and the item providers page.  * The label ""Automatic behavior"" is misleading. Firstly, this label doesn't really mean a lot. Maybe something like ""Remember selected group"" would be better. Secondly, this preference is independent from the selected group/filter, still it is on the same level as the Description group, which is dependent on the selection. Maybe we should put the description and the list of filters into a group?Page Groups  * Label at the top has a larger margin to the list below than on previous pages.  * Same last two as for filtersItem Providers  * To be consistent with other pages in EMF Compare (e.g. post processors), it'd be good to have a brief label at the top.

However, on the implementation side (the actual base index), the concerns are not truly orthogonal (e.g. if we have 'instance' indexing, we get stats and notifications practically for free), so there are only really these 5 modes of operation. The nontrivial part of the lattice logic must be provided somewhere (e.g. if matcher backend A requests instance and notification indexing, we do nothing when backend B later requests stats). So with a bit more work, we could probably have ├übel's service flags on the IQRC API, and the indexing level enum or something equivalent in the base index itself. Is it worth it?Also, what's the nicest way to provide the 'flags'? @Data class with three boolean fields? EnumSet for a three-valued enum representing the three services?

So far, it tracks the milestones and is equivalent to the milestone TPD.

Then why was camel case also not set as suffix proposal?In a similar way, there could be some other existing type of proposal or one that could be implemented later, which may need to be handled similar to camelCaseMatch while validation.Hence, as I had suggested during code walk-through, I feel it would be better if you have the property as substringProposal instead of suffixProposal, which would be specific to your feature and will be set only for substring proposals. Then you can check for coreProposal.isSubstringProposal() in JDT/UI and call substringMatch for that, while leaving rest of the code as it is.Please check the above approach and let me know if there is any problem with that.",9,4800,2015/8/18 13:23,2015/7/14 13:11,2015/8/14 10:13,741,MERGED,1,14,4,6,15,positive,3,-1

Before that, please have a look at the following as well:- It is not working for type names, e.g. when you type a substring of a class name to declare a field.- The relevance / proposal order is mixed up when fields are proposed with types. Example:public class C {	int intField;	String stringField;	{		field|	}}- In case of methods, the substring is also matched in its parameters, return type, declaring type etc. I think it should be restricted to only the method name.- Filtering of the results still seems to have some issue. Not sure if the filtered results look confusing or non-relevant due to the above issue of not restricting the match to just the name or if it is due to the non-subsequent matching. We can check that once the above issue is fixed. Also, pattern highlighting in the proposal will be very useful with this feature. Please check if it is simple to implement. Otherwise, we can do that later.",4,4800,2015/7/29 12:13,2015/7/14 13:11,2015/7/27 12:12,311,MERGED,4,62,3,5,15,positive,3,-2

745,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1(5 comments)Hi Jonah, great commit!  We would need some small changes, 1 necessary, others optional:1) Some script languages (like JS) do not support method overloading. So you cannot @wrap multiple methods with the same name. The last one wrapped will override the first one. You either need to find different names or wrap just one of those methods and use Object as an input parameter. Using instanceOf checks you might delegate calls to your original methods (which are not wrapped in this case). Your current contribution might still work in a lot of cases, but this is by pure chance and might cease to work in a future version of Rhino.2) as your module is stateless, you might use static methods only. This will allow me to call these methods without creating an instance of the module in the future3) We create dedicated inline documentation for modules. To link to other modules/wrapped methods use @module instead of @link. eg {@module #myMethod} (without signature).4) If you like you might also move your method directly to modules.platform as it would definitely fit there. Otherwise you need to check in project specific formatter and save actions as we did for the other projects.5) I especially like your usage of the completion provider. You might want to use colors there, See the comment in the code for a link to examples.Great contribution, thanks!",1,5067,2015/10/5 21:58,2015/9/28 13:27,2015/9/28 13:27,0,MERGED,14,433,3,6,2,positive,4,-1

It's the branch that always points to the latest release.

1020,"Patch Set 1:The reason why the read-only state of resources wasn't being cached at all in the scenario of showing the context menu in the Model Explorer is because the vast majority of accesses to the read-only manager were to query the read-only state of a resource directly, not indirectly via an EObject contained in the resource.  That was the only API that was cached before:  read-only state of a model element.So, the first major change in this patch is to additionally cache the read-only state of resources in the FSReadOnlyHandler, itself.  This was easily and safely done by a minor refactoring of the AbstractReadOnlyHandler to make the cache available to subclasses.However, this was not sufficient because the cache was actually always a no-op in the context-menu scenario.  The problem here is that caching was only active during the scope of a transaction in the read-only manager's editing domain.  However, the vast majority (if not all) of the read-only queries in the context-menu scenario are done without a transaction.  And even if they were done in a transaction, each and every one probably would have had its own transaction, nullifying any cache and probably making performance a bit worse by always setting up and tearing down the cache machinery.So, the second major change in this patch is to eliminate the cache's tie to transactions.  Now, the cache is implicitly initialized when read-only state is queried and is purged in an async exec (abstracted through an injected Executor).  This fixes the read-only part of the performance problems in the context menu.A bit of work was needed to fix the read-only JUnit tests, by injecting a custom executor that the tests can use to control when the cache is purged to force re-calculation of read-only state of resources as they change state.  Note that the read-only manager's makeWritable(...) API still *synchronously* purges the cache as before, so the make-writable use cases should still work (which is born out by the tests, actually).",1,7155,2015/4/1 1:06,2015/4/1 0:31,2015/4/1 0:40,0,MERGED,9,388,3,6,1,positive,2,-1

1080,"Patch Set 1:None as far as I can see. The class (PathEnvironmentVariable) is private and only used to contribute to the PATH environment variable when cross-compiling. The contribution is the path to the cross compiler you specify in your project settings. Normally that path is prepended. It normally works fine, unless you use say ${ARM_TOOL_PATH} which java.io.File does not understand. It assumes ${ARM_TOOL_PATH} is some form of weird folder name in cwd and hence prepends c:\program files\...\eclipse\bin resulting in a non-existing directory being added to the path. I can't image you'd want to use a relative path to your compiler. If relative, relative to what?

However, I would prefer if the default was ZERO instead of BIG_BANG, because the latter creates a odd value when represented as a string.Alternatively, perhaps even better, we could create a NULL constant that overloads toString() to return an empty string (and can't be normalized/offset?).Maybe we should revive Matthew's patch that creates special classes for these timestamp constants. https://git.eclipse.org/r/24880",2,7609,2015/2/10 19:48,2015/2/6 3:02,2015/2/10 1:18,94,MERGED,28,144,3,5,5,positive,2,-1

1131,"Patch Set 2:(1 comment)> ... the trace data and not its definitionYou are still thinking of ""fields"" and ""aspects"" as two different layers. They can be the same. We are not poking at bits directly here, everything is a ""definition"". It's just a matter of ""what we've implemented to put stuff in ITmfEventField's"" vs ""what we've implemented to put stuff in event aspects"".We could (and eventually should) create aspects programmatically for each field found in a CTF event. This will avoid for example having CTF fields and CTF contexts be both considered as the same thing, while they are slightly different (the context aspects can be defined per channel/trace, the field aspects per event type, etc.)> The user can create the filter without any trace being selected.What is the point of that?? And how can the user create filters with no trace opened if he has to go look for field names in another view, which will be empty because no trace is opened?We are building a graphical tool, we're supposed to make the user's life easier. Like, reading what's in the trace, and offering what can be selected. Not having to have the user read field names in another view then re-type them manually elsewhere. A prepopulated drop-down list would be much more useful than an empty text box here.Anyways, if you really feel that typing subfield names manually is such a desirable feature, I won't nak this. (One small comment though.) In a sense TmfEventFieldAspect is just a shim between the new aspect API and ITmfEventField. If we ever get rid of the latter, then TmfEventFieldAspect will be unneeded too.

1244,"Patch Set 2:(5 comments)Undo/redo works well.  Thanks!  It looks odd, though, that undo/redo changes the selection in the Model Explorer even when focus is currently in a diagram editor.  Especially if I have ""link with editor"" turned on in the explorer because in that case, the linking of the selection doesn't actually happen (which is a good thing, but looks like a bug).  I would expect the changed selection on undo/redo to be reflected in the diagram, but it isn't.  It's only selection changes caused by mouse or keyboard in the explorer view that are propagated to the diagram.Anyways, that can all be avoided simply by having the RevealResultCommand do its thing only if its view part is currently active.  That's actually better than what I suggested last time (I suggested then that the command should operate on whatever is the current view, but that would be bad, because that view may provide IRevealSemanticElement but not be the explorer, which would be confusing at best).",2,8433,2014/11/4 18:37,2014/10/30 10:50,2014/11/4 15:49,124,MERGED,13,764,2,3,3,positive,3,-2
1245,"Patch Set 1: Verified-1 Code-Review-1Redoing a new element creation that was undone does not select-reveal the (re)created element.I understand that we can't just do as an EMF-generated editor does and attach a command-stack listener that selects the affected objects of whatever was the last command executed/undone/redone, because it could have been a command in the diagram or other context that should not alter the Model Explorer selection.   So, the idea of the command wrapper is neat.However, the command-wrapper would be more reusable/safe if it didn't explicitly look for the Model Explorer view (maybe there are multiple instances of it!) but instead checked that the currently active view provides the IRevealSemanticElement protocol.  Also, it should account for selecting the object(s) affected by undo and redo.  In the case of redo, that's the same as execute, but in the case of undo, the affected object should be the one that the new object had been created in.Also, why select-reveal only the first result?  If multiple objects were created, I would expect all of them to be selected.

1378,"Patch Set 1:There are three groups of changes in this change-set:(a) update the Properties View implementation to reuse the same SWT controls    for its tabs when the selection changes to another single or multiple    selection presenting the same Views (according to the property-sheet model).    This is a ""compatible"" selection	(b) update the DataSource and ModelElement APIs that provide the source of    data bindings in the Properties View to allow a compatible selection to be    injected into the SWT controls already showing	(c) implementation of delegating observables that support the ModelElements'    dynamic updating of their data-binding sources	Part (a) is largely just a matter of updating the DefaultDisplayEngine to detect that the set of Views it asked to provide tab-descriptors for is the same as the set of Views for which it last provided tabs.  In this case, the existing tabs and all of their controls are re-used and the new selection is pushed into the DataSource that is currently feeding these controls.  Hopefully, the infrastructural changes in parts (b) and (c) that make this possible will allow us to further refine the re-use of controls such that any View will only be created once and can be swapped in and out of tabs using PageBooks.Part (b) updates the DataSource to support replacement of its selection.  On injection of a new selection, a notification is broadcast to announce the change and ModelElements listening to the DataSource update themselves to pick up the new selection.  This entails to fundamental changes in the way that ModelElements work:  (i) the ModelElementFactory now tells a newly created ModelElement which      factory created it, so that the ModelElement can delegate to that factory the      update for a new selection.  This is necessary because it is the factory that      knew how to unpack from the selection what the ModelElement needs when      creating the  element, so it is the best able to update the element later.  All      of the various ModelElementFactory implementations add this new capability      to update an existing element with a new selection	    (ii) when a ModelElement creates an IObservable for one of its properties, it      now wraps that observable in a new delegator pattern.  The delegator is      what ends up ultimately being bound to SWT controls.  To ensure that we      don't have to rebuild those bindings every time the selection changes      (which would entail considerable API churn to make accessible after the      fact), these observable delegators allow their delegates to be replaced at      any time (assuming that the replacement is the same kind of observable,      based on the ""compatible selection"").  Replacing the delegate fires the      usual observable change event, which updates the UI accordingly via the      bindings.	  Part (c) is the implementation of the delegating observables.  They ensure that the entire contract of the underlying observable is provided (including all custom interfaces such as ICommitListener) via the dynamic proxy class mechanism.  The usual contract of observables is implemented, including tracking the invocation of getter methods, all verified with a fairly comprehensive suite of JUnits tests.",1,9145,2014/5/26 20:04,2014/5/23 2:44,2014/5/26 19:58,89,MERGED,70,3980,2,4,6,positive,2,-1

It should only happen on first use.  The provider chooses to to initialize, and the GUI has no idea this is even taking place.  The current filter/provider mechanism has no callbacks regarding initialization (only a clear cache method).   This leaves us with 2 choices:  Go back to the modal dialog with cancel option, or create a provider status callback mechanism.

When I remove a column, the column stays, but when I try to add it, it adds a new duplicate one.5- If I scroll down the view and then change the debug context (but stay in the same launch) the view scrolls back to the top.  I think it would be more user-friendly to not change the view at all.  Maybe it is as simple as noticing that the context change can be ignored since the ICommandControlDMContext is the same.6- I got this NPE when switching from one launch to antoher sometimes.

However, the 'fetch' link remains usable, which will trigger a ""Fething data..."" which will only complete once the inferior is interrupted8- If there are multiple debug contexts selected,  the code choosed the first one arbitrarily.  This is not clear to the user. I suggest one of two things:  a) If all selected contexts have the same parent ICommandControlDMContext, then display resources as done now using any one context. If the parents are different, then disable and empty the view or   b) Always disable and empty the view for multi-selection9- The case where -info-os returns an error does not seem to be handled properly.  For example, if I have the OSResources view open when using a post-mortem session (core file), GDB gives:   448,664 [MI]  24-info-os   448,666 [MI]  24^error,msg=""Can not fetch data now.""   or   600,684 [MI]  25-info-os modules   600,686 [MI]  25^error,msg=""Can not fetch data now.""But the view is stuck showing ""Determining available OS resource classes..."" or ""Fetching data..."" depending on the timing.10- One time I got the following reply from GDB (maybe my gdbserver was wrong), but it caused an NPE that I think we should guard against:   915,516 [MI]  42-info-os semaphores   921,522 [MI]  ~""Ignoring packet error, continuing...\n""   921,523 [MI]  42^error,msg=""Can not fetch data now.""Exception in thread ""MI RX Thread"" java.lang.NullPointerException    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.output.MIInfoOsInfo.get(MIInfoOsInfo.java:173)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.output.MIInfoOsInfo.parseResourcesInformation(MIInfoOsInfo.java:128)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.output.MIInfoOsInfo.<init>(MIInfoOsInfo.java:75)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.commands.MIInfoOs.getResult(MIInfoOs.java:47)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.commands.MIInfoOs.getResult(MIInfoOs.java:1)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.AbstractMIControl$RxThread.processMIOutput(AbstractMIControl.java:907)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.AbstractMIControl$RxThread.run(AbstractMIControl.java:754)11- The new osresources.gif icon should go under the view16 folder and should be renamed to osresources_view.gif,    i.e., dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/icons/full/view16/osresources_view.gif    Don't forget to update the plugin.xml file to match12- In MANIFEST.MF, please export the new osview package, as the other packages are exported",7,9709,2012/9/12 18:51,2012/5/5 8:54,2012/9/12 8:43,3119,MERGED,17,1896,2,4,9,positive,3,-2

1632,"Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1(1 comment)Hi,thanks for the contribution. But it has some things you need to fix/add.1. Trailing white spaces. You need to ensure that there are no trailing whitespaces. You can configure that in git config, so that is handled automatically.2. I think there are some issues in SizeConfig. On getSize() you always calculate percentage sizes. But that call should only be performed if percentage sizing is enabled. Why did you remove that check?Also you forgot to invalidate your aggregate cache when calling setSize(). Currently you are only doing this on setDefaultSize() and setPercentageSize().3. I would also like to see test cases for your changes. With changing the aggregate calculation for caching you are changing quite a basic logic. This needs to be tested well.

1748,"Patch Set 2:> This is by design. Merely changing null.unboxInt() to return 0 instead of -1 will break MANY things only in the state system (like stack attributes, off the top of my head). And that's without talking about views.There's a few things broken as it is now:- You can't get a -1 Int value from the factory method but you can get one using incrementAttribute() on a -2 Int value- Calling incrementAttribute() on this -1 Int value skips 0 and goes to 1.- The State System Explorer view cannot display a factory-made -1 Int value (as it is nullValue), it shows a blank value.If there is any code that is using the unboxed value of nullValue to check for null, that is badly designed code because it cannot differentiate with a real Int of that same value, it should use isNull(). I believe it's better to bite the bullet and correct that code now. Hopefully all of it is fixed by the patch now.Mathematically, I think it makes more sense to use zero as the null value's numerical value.> This is also by design. If we start to allow unboxing from one type to another, people might stop caring about what the actual type is, and always unbox their things into longs for example, doing costly casts over and over.It's a point to consider, but I prefer to give the benefit of the doubt and the flexibility to the designers. In the code I'm doing now, I have to do floating point mathematical operations on a list of state values that can be a mix of Int, Long, Double or nullValue. Using unboxDouble() gives much cleaner code than having a if-else or switch statement on the value Type to figure out the correct unboxing method.The unit tests should be correct now. The LTTng kernel state system creates a Threads/-1 attribute because the first events arrive before the Current_thread attribute has any value set. I considered updating the expected test state system with these events using the Threads/0 attribute (due to the current thread nullValue's int value), but decided against it because it would still be incorrect to consider that these events occurred in the swapper (0) thread. So the nullValue current thread continues uses the -1 attribute for the 'unknown' thread.",2,10842,2013/9/13 20:17,2013/9/12 22:00,2013/9/13 19:47,21,MERGED,7,51,3,6,6,positive,3,-2

AFAICT, the reading of the filestamp is rather unexpensive (at least compared to not reading it, and re-hashing file contents all the time ;)).if the keep() method is the wrong place, or if more care needs to be taken when to call it with zero (old behaviour) or the current file's timestamp (new behaviour) - i can't tell, but you may tell me, and i'll do my best :)currently i just can say that all unit tests go ok, and that i'm quite satisfied with how /fast/ this makes working with JGit/EGit; it really is approximately 50 times faster in most situations, and i had to wait _a lot_ before.",3,12614,2012/6/5 15:12,2012/6/4 11:18,2012/6/4 11:18,0,MERGED,1,18,3,8,6,positive,3,-1

2523,"Patch Set 6: (5 inline comments)Regarding the latest performance improvements: that's really great and also votes for Patience diff as default diff.But one more general view on it here: Shawn last comment contained lines like:     testMyers 1280000 bytes took  21600751000 ns. N=2560000, D=4210, time/(N*D):2E0, time/(N*D^2):4.76E-4   testPatience 1280000 bytes took   3022629000 ns. N=2560000, D=793, time/(N*D):1.49E0, time/(N*D^2):1.88E-3This tells us that Patience diff can be even faster then Myers. But even more interesting to me is the value for D (the size of the found edit-script). PatienceDiff found an 5 times lesser edits than myers. I won't say that smaller edit-scripts (with probably huger regions) are better, but my big hope is that PatienceDiff brings ""better diffs"" regarding readability by humans.

Create a new file x in the IDE and add it to Git.If you change x outside Eclipse, the repo scan triggers an indexChanged event and x is refreshed2. Change a file y that is in repo outside the IDE.The repo scan does not get this change, no refresh is performed.I think all external changes to resources should be refreshed or no change.GitLighweightDecorator listens to repo changes. So when refresh stuff is turned of, still changes like staged, branch change etc are shown to the user. Just the dirty information is missing and external changes are not refreshed. Reacting to external changes is provided by setting ""refresh automatically"", so this should be used for any kind of external change (you mentioned ""refresh automatically"" has a too long delay until it works).Summary: I have some doubts if it is the right way to refresh resources based on Git Repo eventing because not all external content changes in the working tree are detected.Furthermore this EGit refresh mechanism somehow does the Job of a standard mechanism (""refresh automatically"").",3,13318,2010/8/11 9:13,2010/8/10 23:15,2010/8/10 23:23,0,MERGED,8,236,2,5,9,positive,3,-2

Large binary objects are probably less frequently modified by the user in the working directory, so we're probably less likely to actually need this faster access.

2968,"Patch Set 1:A further change in how Model Explorer manages refresh, to avoid recalculating the entire tree structure on every model edit, which doesn't scale well on large models.First, the Model Explorer's resource-set listener now only schedules structural refreshes for the specific objects that notified changes.Second, the UMLLabelProvider fires LabelProviderChangedEvents to trigger label updates for elements that derive their labels from other related elements, when those related elements are changed.  This required a new mix-in interface for label providers in the Label Provider Service to allow Model Explorer and other clients to pass notifications to them on changes in the model.  I'm not entirely happy with this solution, but it does address a couple of issues with the approach I would rather have taken, which is having individual label providers listen for model changes themselves:  * the providers registered with the Label Provider Service aren't initialized with a    ResourceSet, ServicesRegistry, or other context in which they can find the    model to listen to  * providers could discover, as they are asked to provide labels, the objects they    need to listen to.  But should they be Adapters or ResourceSetListeners?  And    can we be sure that they won't leak, that the providers will be disposed at the    right time so that they can remove listeners/adapters?  * only the Model Explorer (for now) needs label providers to trigger updates.    Element-picker dialogs and other widgets in the Properties view, for example,    don't have this need, so this design ensures that the large number of other    UMLLabelProviders that are created (there are lots) don't all listen for model    changes    I am willing to explore this alternative further if reviewers agree that the new IDependentLabelProvider interface isn't a great thing.Another point that I'm not sure about is the changes in the SemanticUMLContentProvider to prevent addition/removal of stereotype applications from a resource triggering complete refresh of the Model Explorer.  I don't know in what contexts this might break some UI that depends on that refresh trigger.  The consequence of reverting the SemanticUMLContentProvider changes is only that applying/unapplying stereotypes results in a long lag in the UI on large models as the Model Explorer refreshes itself.

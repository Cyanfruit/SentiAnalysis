On the other hand it is no problem to do the fix on the release 0.13 track and then to upport them to the current development version (master branch).,2,1051,2016/10/6 14:20,2016/10/5 17:57,2016/10/5 18:38,0,MERGED,1,8,3,6,3,positive,3,-1
114,"Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1I've tested the latest patch-set (I rebased on the latest merged one, just to be sure I tested it with the latest delivered stuff). This seem to work good enough with respect to the issue identified in the Bugzilla, i.e. both the name and type column are visible in the edit dialog. The previous issue with the name column gradually filling the complete table in the properties view is not happening (not even in a new workspace).There are some drawbacks, e.g. the horizontal scrollbar and the resizing does not work. But all this is already brought up within the scope of https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=495352.So I guess that this should be ""good enough"" for 0.8, and then we can introduce the improvements tracked by https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=495352 later when we have gotten the needed fixes in base Papyrus.",2,1052,2016/10/6 14:41,2016/10/6 13:16,2016/10/6 14:24,1,MERGED,2,51,5,9,2,positive,3,-1

It has the right background in the post processor page and the item providers page.Page Filters  * I'd decrease min width a bit  * The description area has a slightly different background than the rest (on my Linux box using GTK2). It has the right background in the post processor page and the item providers page.  * The label ""Automatic behavior"" is misleading. Firstly, this label doesn't really mean a lot. Maybe something like ""Remember selected group"" would be better. Secondly, this preference is independent from the selected group/filter, still it is on the same level as the Description group, which is dependent on the selection. Maybe we should put the description and the list of filters into a group?Page Groups  * Label at the top has a larger margin to the list below than on previous pages.  * Same last two as for filtersItem Providers  * To be consistent with other pages in EMF Compare (e.g. post processors), it'd be good to have a brief label at the top.

524,"Patch Set 7:> ""allowNulls"", the design of the state system is that there should be no null values when returning from a query. It's not explicitely enforced in the backends' runtime code, but it could be. Testing this means testing cases that are not supposed to happen.When used along with a StateSystem, the query does not return null because the StateSystem first fills the interval list with a subset of the intervals and the backend fills it with the remaining subset, and both subsets complete each other and are mutually exclusive. So it is perfectly valid and expected in our runtime implementation that a backend does not fill some of the elements in the interval list. I could easily foresee test cases asserting that some elements must be null in the result of a query. These assertions could be checked after executing testDoQuery() which should therefore complete without failing.> The two ""abstract"" methods (getBackendForBuilding/getBackendForQuerying). The concept of ""reopening"" only applies to the HistoryTreeBackend, this notion should remain in that test class, not in the -Base. Parameters and the ""reopen"" constructor parameter is a nice way to offer both alternatives.Any backend could support reopening and then should override getBackendForQuerying(). Those backends that don't support it don't have to do anything. I think this is perfectly fine. My solution has the advantage to reduce code duplication. In the context of unit test code, I believe this is more important than conceptual considerations.> The abstract method I'm suggesting tells the implementation to ""create a backend and insert these intervals"". This is a clear initialization step.This clear initialization method is implemented in a final protected method that performs these steps in the base class in my patch. I think it is much better.> The pattern of an abstract method to set a protected field is used in other tests. It should be kept as consistent as possible.I hope you are not suggesting that forcing all subclasses to implement a method that can more easily be provided by the base class is preferable for reasons of consistency.I therefore respectfully disagree with your remaining objections. I think this patch is now way, way above the review threshold for unit test code. Thank you for your constructive feedback along the way.",7,3467,2016/1/15 22:36,2016/1/6 23:38,2016/1/15 18:57,211,MERGED,4,361,3,5,13,positive,3,-2
525,"Patch Set 4:(8 comments)Looking good. Having both the -Base and a HistoryTreeBackendTest separates nicely what is specific to all backends (like the backend fixture), while HistoryTreeBackendTest owns what is specific to that backend, like the temp file.Good idea about splitting testDoQuery too, it will make it easy to re-use for different interval sets.I'd keep InMemoryBackendTest for another patch. We could move the tests in that class into the new base class to have them run on other backends.I'd also prefer to stick it to one abstract class that sets the backend. This pattern is used in other test classes in the tree. Each test would have to run prepareBackend(something), but then they don't have to worry about disposing it.New patchset inc.",4,3467,2016/1/15 6:34,2016/1/6 23:38,2016/1/14 21:54,190,MERGED,4,323,4,8,13,positive,2,-1

Before that, please have a look at the following as well:- It is not working for type names, e.g. when you type a substring of a class name to declare a field.- The relevance / proposal order is mixed up when fields are proposed with types. Example:public class C {	int intField;	String stringField;	{		field|	}}- In case of methods, the substring is also matched in its parameters, return type, declaring type etc. I think it should be restricted to only the method name.- Filtering of the results still seems to have some issue. Not sure if the filtered results look confusing or non-relevant due to the above issue of not restricting the match to just the name or if it is due to the non-subsequent matching. We can check that once the above issue is fixed. Also, pattern highlighting in the proposal will be very useful with this feature. Please check if it is simple to implement. Otherwise, we can do that later.",4,4800,2015/7/29 12:13,2015/7/14 13:11,2015/7/27 12:12,311,MERGED,4,62,3,5,15,positive,3,-2

It's the branch that always points to the latest release. The Git master branch does not have this semantic.Also my guess is that in most cases, when users want to convert their repository to Gitflow, it would make more sense to turn the existing master into develop (e.g. the EGit repository).",4,5398,2015/9/9 23:20,2015/8/28 21:44,2015/9/9 22:53,289,MERGED,10,386,3,6,6,positive,3,-2

1020,"Patch Set 1:The reason why the read-only state of resources wasn't being cached at all in the scenario of showing the context menu in the Model Explorer is because the vast majority of accesses to the read-only manager were to query the read-only state of a resource directly, not indirectly via an EObject contained in the resource.  That was the only API that was cached before:  read-only state of a model element.So, the first major change in this patch is to additionally cache the read-only state of resources in the FSReadOnlyHandler, itself.  This was easily and safely done by a minor refactoring of the AbstractReadOnlyHandler to make the cache available to subclasses.However, this was not sufficient because the cache was actually always a no-op in the context-menu scenario.  The problem here is that caching was only active during the scope of a transaction in the read-only manager's editing domain.  However, the vast majority (if not all) of the read-only queries in the context-menu scenario are done without a transaction.  And even if they were done in a transaction, each and every one probably would have had its own transaction, nullifying any cache and probably making performance a bit worse by always setting up and tearing down the cache machinery.So, the second major change in this patch is to eliminate the cache's tie to transactions.  Now, the cache is implicitly initialized when read-only state is queried and is purged in an async exec (abstracted through an injected Executor).  This fixes the read-only part of the performance problems in the context menu.A bit of work was needed to fix the read-only JUnit tests, by injecting a custom executor that the tests can use to control when the cache is purged to force re-calculation of read-only state of resources as they change state.  Note that the read-only manager's makeWritable(...) API still *synchronously* purges the cache as before, so the make-writable use cases should still work (which is born out by the tests, actually).",1,7155,2015/4/1 1:06,2015/4/1 0:31,2015/4/1 0:40,0,MERGED,9,388,3,6,1,positive,2,-1

So, the idea of the command wrapper is neat.However, the command-wrapper would be more reusable/safe if it didn't explicitly look for the Model Explorer view (maybe there are multiple instances of it!) but instead checked that the currently active view provides the IRevealSemanticElement protocol.  Also, it should account for selecting the object(s) affected by undo and redo.  In the case of redo, that's the same as execute, but in the case of undo, the affected object should be the one that the new object had been created in.Also, why select-reveal only the first result?

1378,"Patch Set 1:There are three groups of changes in this change-set:(a) update the Properties View implementation to reuse the same SWT controls    for its tabs when the selection changes to another single or multiple    selection presenting the same Views (according to the property-sheet model).    This is a ""compatible"" selection	(b) update the DataSource and ModelElement APIs that provide the source of    data bindings in the Properties View to allow a compatible selection to be    injected into the SWT controls already showing	(c) implementation of delegating observables that support the ModelElements'    dynamic updating of their data-binding sources	Part (a) is largely just a matter of updating the DefaultDisplayEngine to detect that the set of Views it asked to provide tab-descriptors for is the same as the set of Views for which it last provided tabs.  In this case, the existing tabs and all of their controls are re-used and the new selection is pushed into the DataSource that is currently feeding these controls.  Hopefully, the infrastructural changes in parts (b) and (c) that make this possible will allow us to further refine the re-use of controls such that any View will only be created once and can be swapped in and out of tabs using PageBooks.Part (b) updates the DataSource to support replacement of its selection.  On injection of a new selection, a notification is broadcast to announce the change and ModelElements listening to the DataSource update themselves to pick up the new selection.  This entails to fundamental changes in the way that ModelElements work:  (i) the ModelElementFactory now tells a newly created ModelElement which      factory created it, so that the ModelElement can delegate to that factory the      update for a new selection.  This is necessary because it is the factory that      knew how to unpack from the selection what the ModelElement needs when      creating the  element, so it is the best able to update the element later.  All      of the various ModelElementFactory implementations add this new capability      to update an existing element with a new selection	    (ii) when a ModelElement creates an IObservable for one of its properties, it      now wraps that observable in a new delegator pattern.  The delegator is      what ends up ultimately being bound to SWT controls.  To ensure that we      don't have to rebuild those bindings every time the selection changes      (which would entail considerable API churn to make accessible after the      fact), these observable delegators allow their delegates to be replaced at      any time (assuming that the replacement is the same kind of observable,      based on the ""compatible selection"").  Replacing the delegate fires the      usual observable change event, which updates the UI accordingly via the      bindings.	  Part (c) is the implementation of the delegating observables.  They ensure that the entire contract of the underlying observable is provided (including all custom interfaces such as ICommitListener) via the dynamic proxy class mechanism.  The usual contract of observables is implemented, including tracking the invocation of getter methods, all verified with a fairly comprehensive suite of JUnits tests.",1,9145,2014/5/26 20:04,2014/5/23 2:44,2014/5/26 19:58,89,MERGED,70,3980,2,4,6,positive,2,-1

The current filter/provider mechanism has no callbacks regarding initialization (only a clear cache method).

When I remove a column, the column stays, but when I try to add it, it adds a new duplicate one.5- If I scroll down the view and then change the debug context (but stay in the same launch) the view scrolls back to the top.  I think it would be more user-friendly to not change the view at all.  Maybe it is as simple as noticing that the context change can be ignored since the ICommandControlDMContext is the same.6- I got this NPE when switching from one launch to antoher sometimes.  I might have screwed up my launch, but it shows that it could happen:java.lang.NullPointerException    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.osview.OSResourcesView.setDebugContext(OSResourcesView.java:256)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.osview.OSResourcesView.setDebugContext(OSResourcesView.java:245)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.osview.OSResourcesView.access$4(OSResourcesView.java:214)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.osview.OSResourcesView$4.debugContextChanged(OSResourcesView.java:193)    at org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.contexts.DebugWindowContextService$1.run(DebugWindowContextService.java:212)    at org.eclipse.core.runtime.SafeRunner.run(SafeRunner.java:42)    at org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.contexts.DebugWindowContextService.notify(DebugWindowContextService.java:210)    at org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.contexts.DebugWindowContextService.notify(DebugWindowContextService.java:185)    at org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.contexts.DebugWindowContextService.debugContextChanged(DebugWindowContextService.java:408)    at org.eclipse.debug.ui.contexts.AbstractDebugContextProvider$1.run(AbstractDebugContextProvider.java:79)7- In all-stop mode, I like how the menus become grayed out when the target is not available.  However, the 'fetch' link remains usable, which will trigger a ""Fething data..."" which will only complete once the inferior is interrupted8- If there are multiple debug contexts selected,  the code choosed the first one arbitrarily.  This is not clear to the user. I suggest one of two things:  a) If all selected contexts have the same parent ICommandControlDMContext, then display resources as done now using any one context. If the parents are different, then disable and empty the view or   b) Always disable and empty the view for multi-selection9- The case where -info-os returns an error does not seem to be handled properly.  For example, if I have the OSResources view open when using a post-mortem session (core file), GDB gives:   448,664 [MI]  24-info-os   448,666 [MI]  24^error,msg=""Can not fetch data now.""   or   600,684 [MI]  25-info-os modules   600,686 [MI]  25^error,msg=""Can not fetch data now.""But the view is stuck showing ""Determining available OS resource classes..."" or ""Fetching data..."" depending on the timing.10- One time I got the following reply from GDB (maybe my gdbserver was wrong), but it caused an NPE that I think we should guard against:   915,516 [MI]  42-info-os semaphores   921,522 [MI]  ~""Ignoring packet error, continuing...\n""   921,523 [MI]  42^error,msg=""Can not fetch data now.""Exception in thread ""MI RX Thread"" java.lang.NullPointerException    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.output.MIInfoOsInfo.get(MIInfoOsInfo.java:173)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.output.MIInfoOsInfo.parseResourcesInformation(MIInfoOsInfo.java:128)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.output.MIInfoOsInfo.<init>(MIInfoOsInfo.java:75)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.commands.MIInfoOs.getResult(MIInfoOs.java:47)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.commands.MIInfoOs.getResult(MIInfoOs.java:1)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.AbstractMIControl$RxThread.processMIOutput(AbstractMIControl.java:907)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.AbstractMIControl$RxThread.run(AbstractMIControl.java:754)11- The new osresources.gif icon should go under the view16 folder and should be renamed to osresources_view.gif,    i.e., dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/icons/full/view16/osresources_view.gif    Don't forget to update the plugin.xml file to match12- In MANIFEST.MF, please export the new osview package, as the other packages are exported",7,9709,2012/9/12 18:51,2012/5/5 8:54,2012/9/12 8:43,3119,MERGED,17,1896,2,4,9,positive,3,-2

The distinction can be seen for example in the NodeWriter. If an I(CPP)ASTAttribute is encountered in a IASTAttributeOwner it is expected to be a GCC attribute. If an ICPPASTAttributeSpecifier is encountered there, it is expected to be a C++11 attribute. The previous implementation of attributes is a bit limiting regarding the capabilities required by C++11 attributes (scope and multiple attributes in one specifier).I also thought about a solution which introduces an attribute specifier for GCC attributes, but that would break the current API.

Change a file y that is in repo outside the IDE.The repo scan does not get this change, no refresh is performed.I think all external changes to resources should be refreshed or no change.GitLighweightDecorator listens to repo changes. So when refresh stuff is turned of, still changes like staged, branch change etc are shown to the user. Just the dirty information is missing and external changes are not refreshed. Reacting to external changes is provided by setting ""refresh automatically"", so this should be used for any kind of external change (you mentioned ""refresh automatically"" has a too long delay until it works).Summary: I have some doubts if it is the right way to refresh resources based on Git Repo eventing because not all external content changes in the working tree are detected.Furthermore this EGit refresh mechanism somehow does the Job of a standard mechanism (""refresh automatically"").",3,13318,2010/8/11 9:13,2010/8/10 23:15,2010/8/10 23:23,0,MERGED,8,236,2,5,9,positive,3,-2

Large binary objects are probably less frequently modified by the user in the working directory, so we're probably less likely to actually need this faster access.

2968,"Patch Set 1:A further change in how Model Explorer manages refresh, to avoid recalculating the entire tree structure on every model edit, which doesn't scale well on large models.First, the Model Explorer's resource-set listener now only schedules structural refreshes for the specific objects that notified changes.Second, the UMLLabelProvider fires LabelProviderChangedEvents to trigger label updates for elements that derive their labels from other related elements, when those related elements are changed.  This required a new mix-in interface for label providers in the Label Provider Service to allow Model Explorer and other clients to pass notifications to them on changes in the model.  I'm not entirely happy with this solution, but it does address a couple of issues with the approach I would rather have taken, which is having individual label providers listen for model changes themselves:  * the providers registered with the Label Provider Service aren't initialized with a    ResourceSet, ServicesRegistry, or other context in which they can find the    model to listen to  * providers could discover, as they are asked to provide labels, the objects they    need to listen to.  But should they be Adapters or ResourceSetListeners?  And    can we be sure that they won't leak, that the providers will be disposed at the    right time so that they can remove listeners/adapters?  * only the Model Explorer (for now) needs label providers to trigger updates.    Element-picker dialogs and other widgets in the Properties view, for example,    don't have this need, so this design ensures that the large number of other    UMLLabelProviders that are created (there are lots) don't all listen for model    changes    I am willing to explore this alternative further if reviewers agree that the new IDependentLabelProvider interface isn't a great thing.Another point that I'm not sure about is the changes in the SemanticUMLContentProvider to prevent addition/removal of stereotype applications from a resource triggering complete refresh of the Model Explorer.  I don't know in what contexts this might break some UI that depends on that refresh trigger.  The consequence of reverting the SemanticUMLContentProvider changes is only that applying/unapplying stereotypes results in a long lag in the UI on large models as the Model Explorer refreshes itself.

99,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2 Verified+1Thanks for the contribution, Fred!  Even paying attention to copyright statements.This change certainly cuts neatly through a bunch of unnecessary and wonky code.  I was going to complain that changing the APIs in the UI classes from working with URIs to working with IResources results in a loss of generality, so that it would be more difficult to support exporting diagrams to the host filesystem (which is desperately needed, IMO) or other destinations, and that IResource is not even as appropriate a type as IContainer, but then I observed that the entire export infrastructure beneath the UI is all pinned to the IResource contract, anyways.  That, combined with the fact that any clients trying to use these UI bits would have had to construct nonsense URIs, means that I don't mind that this technically is an API-breaking change because that API was already non-functional and it will have to break again some time anyways to support exporting to non-workspace destinations.

But it's worth soliciting feedback from the users who strongly wanted this feature back.I think we should *always* show other projects in the Other category.  The menu item to enable this (""ÔÇªand show remaining projects in "") looks rather bizarre.

But if you take a closer look between the screen shot for case 1 and case 2, the difference is that the ""black line"" has its ending a bit further in for case 2, i.e. the intention is to move p2 inside the package Protocols. For case 1 the intention is not to move p2 inside package Protocols but order it after, i.e. it should be a peer to the package Protocols.Anyway, since case 2 is about moving p2 inside the package Protocols, I assume that the expected result should be that p2 should be moved before p1 inside the package Protocols. As it looks now, it replaces it, at least when just looking in the model explorer with the protocol customization enabled. But the protocol message from p1Msg is now contained in p2 instead.If I disable the protocol customization, then it looks like a real mess.

241,"Patch Set 14:Ok, lets step back a bit here: who are the implementors and the users of the IQueryRuntimeContext API? Implementors are the Scope providers, and users backend providers? Is this correct? Rete and LS are not problematic, as they are developed in parallel with this API, so they can keep up with the API.The important question is, do we consider the chance that anyone else would implement some query backend in the future that will not be developed in VIATRA? If there won't be anyone, we should close down this API, and then the entire conversation will be moot, and we should indeed consider only the implementors of scopes.However, and I believe, this is the case, if we want to have an API for externals to provide backend implementations, the IQueryRuntimeContext API should remain compatible for both users and implementors, and appropriate steps should be taken to avoid breakage (e.g. the methods there will be in 1.4 should be stable enough). > Even if we promote the IQRC to end-users in the future, that's > hardly an argument to breaking compatiblity now.We have already broken compatibility. By adding new methods to the interface that was implemented directly by scope providers they have to be updated.

If something is public AND non-internal, then it becomes a OSGi API.But non-public things have never been considered API, they are completely inaccessible from things outside their own package. This is restricted at the compiler level.Our compiler settings don't enforce javadoc for default and private members, because those are necessarily invisible from outside their package.Tbh, I don't think it's a bad idea to put Javadoc on all classes, more information is always good.

439,"Patch Set 4:> Wow - this was really close. I tested this on Windows and already > typed in my +2 message. Only picking up one cup of coffee saved us > from accidentily submitting thisI still think this fix is the right thing to do, not closing resource is never a good idea but this change is defeating the RepositoryCache creator original intent, which I think was to keep stuff around as long as possible by using SoftReference.I tested this series and so far the memory consumption drastically improved because the RepositoryCache is no longer slowly growing but I can see that the disk IO increased and performance degraded in operations involving many repositories, like listing projects in Gerrit (ls-projects command).Relying on the SoftReference mechanism to evict old unused repository is not a good idea because the eviction becomes unpredictable. For example, our Gerrit master JVM heap is set to 58GB, the old generation space(Tenured Generation) is 44GB which leaves 14GB for the eden and survivor spaces. The old generation space eventually becomes full (mostly by the caches including the unbound RepositoryCache) and then the application starts slowing down because GC keeps kicking in. The SoftReference are still not being collected at that point because the buffer of available memory is not bellow the threshold that would make GC consider the SoftReference.All this to say that I will do more testing on our production server but if it turns out that the performance impact is too big, I(we) will need to consider reimplementing the RepositoryCache to achieve the goal of keeping repository in memory but without being forever (I am not sure yet what would be the eviction criteria).",4,3100,2015/9/23 14:43,2015/9/4 19:32,2015/9/18 19:27,335,MERGED,3,30,3,7,6,negative,2,-3

This fixes my most serious concern in regard to honoring the IProgressConstants2.SHOW_IN_TASKBAR_ICON_PROPERTY flag.(b) I can confirm that the system task bar is *not* yet triggered during the RCP startup process, there exists two reasons for this:(b.1) Previous 3.x Workbench code did enter in WorkbenchAdvisor.openWindows() a different code branch, because the lineIStatus status = myConfigurer[0].restoreState();could give a not-OK-status, this is no longer possible, because now WorkbenchConfigurer.restoreState() *always* returns OK_STATUS.(b.2) Now Workbench.createAndRunWorkbench does not wrap the splash handlers progress monitor using TaskBarDelegatingProgressMonitor.(b.3) My test program omits to set SHOW_PROGRESS_ON_STARTUP=true in the plugin_customization.iniTherefore my action items for this week end are:- Upload an improved test program that ensures that the startup presents progress on startup- Try to fix the second unwrapped progress monitorMy most serious concerns for this issue are fixing to honor IProgressConstants2.SHOW_IN_TASKBAR_ICON_PROPERTY.

This allows new themes to control everything without side effects from older themes. Please note that we still have a few bugs in the reset stuff, e.g., Form controls do not all support the reset functionality.So in your case, if I switch from one theme to ""Something else"" all styling must be resetted to the default, e.g., preferences, colors, etc. As you are now argue this reset requirement away for the OS settings in this review, we also tried to argue that away for the preferences but this was strongly requested by the JDT team.",3,6922,2015/4/17 13:56,2015/4/17 10:16,2015/4/17 10:16,0,MERGED,14,218,3,13,10,negative,1,-3

Also in order to do the handling of VM args in this file, it would have required functions to be exported from eclipse.cFinally the changes to eclipse.c are necessary because the previous code that was handling the appendage of VM args was incorrect.

But that doesn't mean we have to replicate all its APIs and functionalities in the TmfEventFieldAspect class. An aspect is supposed to be a singular ""quanta"" of information from an event. A TmfEventFieldAspect is supposed to represent a single field from a event. Not a way to access all the fields of an event, that's what ITmfEvent#getContent is for.That being said, I don't think it's helpful to keep arguing our little points here.

Enabling/disabling the content provider when the menu state changes is a little bit more tricky.

It's not easy to depend on it. * Out of the box the new content provider should not be selected. Only when toggling via menu or by the user, it should get (de-) selected accordingly.* The toggle action should also toggle the content provider, otherwise there will be strange things in the UI when the user (accidentally) disables the content provider.I would hard-wire the action and the content provider, i.e. if the user disables the content provider I would toggle the action to 'Flat'.** -> I like those 3 proposals. However, I don't know I could implement a good RadioState based on content provider activation. Do you have an example of how to do this? Or will I have to use programatic menu contributions to deal with selection? * Same applies to the filters. Here I'd even vote to not surface them in the UI, and do the filtering directly in the content provider. Otherwise, you also have to enable/disable them when toggling the menu.** -> What do you mean by ""filtering directly in the content provider"". I don't think CNF content provider provide a good way to do that. Do you have an example? * The content provider does not react to changes: 'Import as Project' does not let the new project appear, and deleting a nested project does not bring it back as folder. I have to press 'F5' to get the view refreshed.** -> That's indeed an issue. This feature should place a few more workspace/resource listeners to trigger refresh on project creation/deletion. There are already some for some cases, I'll have a look at the reported scenario. * The state of nesting should be stored as dialog setting and not as preference. Maybe this can even be computed by the enabled state of the content provider.** -> ok for persisting it as dialog settings. However, I'd like to keep the preference as a default activation of nested view of projects, so RCP apps could enable this by default from the plugin_customization.ini.

It doesn't matter what the defaults were when the perspective was created, only that the perspective remember what actionSets are active at the moment.This is still true, but ActionSetManager (and also no one else) never persisted the ""disabled"" action sets as user choice. So you could request to show/hide them (depending on the application needs), but once user decides to get rid of some action set, this decision must ""override"" application choice. The best example is the debug action sett with the global debug buttons. In the old implementation you could try to ""hide"" them - but on next restart they will come back again, or, even worse, as soon as you hit a breakpoint - and this mean they will be back in a minute.

The problem here was that the Tabbed Property Sheet would disposed of an entire tab and its contents if the new selection didn't need that tab at all, without any interaction with the XWT-based DisplayEngine.  So, the DefaultDisplayEngine would continue to try to show disposed controls for the General tab (or any other in the same situation).  Now the DefaultDisplayEngine listens for the disposal of the controls that it creates and cleans up its understanding of which reusable controls are still available for which sections in which tabs.The exceptions in multiple-selection scenarios all boiled down to observables being prematurely disposed, either by the composite MultipleObservableValue, or by a DelegatingObservable, or by a ModelElement.  So, now all of these various components that can aggregate/share observables participate in a simple reference-counting scheme so that observables will only be disposed (and will be disposed automatically) when they are no longer in use by any component.",4,9145,2014/7/4 19:11,2014/5/23 2:44,2014/7/4 18:58,1024,MERGED,83,4866,2,4,6,negative,1,-2

I haven't looked in detail at all the files, because there are some relatively major changes that will cause modification to those files.I think we are quite close.  The comments may seem larger than they really are, and I believe it won't take too much effort to get this ready to commit.- I found myself writing comments that I then realized where already part of the patch I had attached to the bugzilla entry.  Can you apply ""Patch to apply after this contribution gets accepted"" to your contribution?  I know that I originally said I'd handle that part, but that was because we were trying to squeeze things into Juno; since we missed Juno, we should do this right, and have the final solution ready before it is committed.- Lets add two new methods to IGDBHardwareAndOS.java (with javadoc):   void getResourceTypes(IDMContext dmc, DataRequestMonitor<String[]> rm);   void getResources(IDMContext dmc, String type, DataRequestMonitor<String[]> rm);- Implement those two methods in GDBHardwareAndOS.java to fetch the list of available resources (-info os), and to get the actual resource information for a specified type (-info-os <type>).  Then you can use that service to fetch the data, instead of sending MI commands directly from the view.- The current implementation is specific to a Linux target with a pre-defined set of resource type.  It would be better to ask GDB what the resources are and base the possible table content on that (using 'info-os' without any parameters).  This would not only allow us to handle any new resources added to GDB, but also different targets (Windows, different Linux, etc)  As the names returned by GDB are not so great ('smh' for example), I think we can keep using the name mapping you define in ResourceClassContributionItem, however, if a resource is not defined in that class we would then use whatever name GDB has sent.  I think this solution will not only be future-proof, but will simplify the implementation.- Please make sure there are no warnings in the new code - Say the view is displaying a resource type, it has the view menu showing.  If I select the 'gdb' node in the debug view (or the launch node, or unselect everything), the view menu disappers.  That is ok.  However, when I select a valid node in the debug view, the menu does not appear again, until I press refresh.- I think having a column waaaaaay on the right hand-side will cause the user to not notice that column.  This happens for Kernel modules.  Can we re-order the colums to have the big column the last one on the right?  Or can we make thatbig column less wide?- Have we already discussed that when selecting a new resource type, the view would not refresh automatically if it is empty?  I don't remember why we would have chosenthat option.  It does not seem user-friendly.- We will need to disable the view when using a session where GDB is too old. By using the IGDBHardwareAndOS service, fixing this will be easy, by simply having the service return an empty list of resources for older GDBs.  This will require a GDBHardwareAndOS_7_5 version of the service to ask GDB for -info-os, while the previous version simply returns an empty list.",1,9709,2012/5/25 17:43,2012/5/5 8:54,2012/5/5 9:00,0,MERGED,12,1337,2,2,9,negative,2,-2

Until here it sounds like a wrapper. But it also provide the mapping between workspace artifacts and DependencyInfos. The class has two responsibilities of that class and I would say that adding the configuration logic of the ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService would make it worse.Also I would like to mention an other point: At the moment as user of the API you can get injected a ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService or/and a ProjectCoordinateProvider as well. The ProjectCoordinateProvider access the ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService inclusive the cache logic. The ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService access the advisors directly. I think this looks a little bit confusing and inconsistent.I mentioned that because I thought about a solution to fix both:What do you think about create a wrapper for ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService which take care of the configuration AND the cache (DependencyInfo --> Pc) logic?The ProjectCoordinateProvider will still have the other cache and would use the wrapped ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService.I think we would get a better separation and could get rid of the inconsistens by using ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService without cache and ProjectCoordinateProvider with cache both.,1,10861,2013/11/22 13:02,2013/11/20 14:57,2013/11/20 14:57,0,MERGED,5,118,3,9,3,negative,2,-3

2223,"Patch Set 3:I find the framing of the tool descriptions very distracting and it isn't done elsewhere in other UI pages.  I suggest just using [] around them as you did before.The tool-tips are now actually special notes to the user and IMO should start with ""Note:"". The perf tool tip doesn't provide anything meaningful since all tools require installation.  I would prefer you say: ""Note: does not require set-up or special compilation"" which explains why we chose it as the default.Instead of ""Cache Using"" for cachegrind which is very awkward I would suggest: ""Cache Usage"" or ""Cache Reporting"".For Callgraph, say: ""Note: requires SystemTap to obtain data"" or something to that effect rather than talking about the SystemTap language.For the ones requiring compilation, I'm not sure whether to include the C/C++ qualifier or not.  They will require rewording if specifying a note: for example, gprof could be worded as:  ""Note: requires compilation of at least one C/C++ source file using ""-pg"" option."" possibly leaving out the C/C++ part which is implied by our tools (see next paragraph).This brings up an interesting issue.  Since our tools only support C/C++, should the Profiling preferences and Properties be under the C/C++ Preferences and Properties.  This should not be solved in this patch and would require a separate RFE or bug.For now, I would suggest adding something to the top Profiling page, which currently doesn't have anything on it, to indicate that the preferences are for tools using the Linux Tools profiling framework for C/C++ projects.  This will at least prevent any confusion.The Restore Defaults buttons on all the pages do not operate properly as they set the default to be the first item in any radio group.

Otherwise servers will fall over periodically when a concurrent writer races against a reader, and the reader will eventually get caught between the two path->inode translations.Go ask Sun why the felt it wasn't necessary to be able to determine the length of an open file from a FileInputStream using the fstat() system call.

2523,"Patch Set 6: (5 inline comments)FWIW, I'm still not done speeding up PatienceDiff.  I think we can do even better than we are doing right now.  Some of the ideas may even be leveraged back into MyersDiff.  I just haven't thought about doing that yet because its still a big ugly black box to me.Coming up with D=793 on PatienceDiff when MyersDiff comes up with D=4210 is because we are only looking at unique common lines.  When PatienceDiff cannot find a unique line in a region, it just bails and does a giant replace, while MyersDiff continues to look for context.If we plugged in MyersDiff at this point as a fallback, we should get D=4210 again.  But I'm not sure that is the best immediate fallback strategy.  We could instead build a histogram of the common lines and pick the least duplicated common lines and try to find the LCS around those.  By using least duplicated we should still avoid nasty cases like ""\t}\n"" as being an anchor point for the matching, but would still be able to break out of the degenerate case.Thus far I have done only very limited testing of PatienceDiff on real-world input.  I did wire it into DiffFormatter and run `jgit log -p` to scan through the diffs.  I didn't see any obvious variations from MyersDiff, but I don't think recent JGit history is a poster child for where patience diff is supposed to produce more readable results.In case you didn't know, my motivation behind PatienceDiff was to find another solution to Gerrit issue 487 [1], infinite loop in MyersDiff.  Unfortunately patience diff really fails on single-character sequences (due to insufficient common unique points), but the algorithm is trivially simple and easy to prove that it will terminate.  I'm probably going to try and do a word-level variant of RawText and see if we can get a word-level thing to work better under PatienceDiff for the intraline difference coloring in Gerrit.Also, MyersDiff is really slow for Gerrit.  For some patches it takes 2.5s to display the page.  Of that 2.5s, 2.450s is spent in MyersDiff doing the intraline work.  Getting a faster algorithm under it would be nice.[1] http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=487",6,13292,2010/9/6 16:40,2010/9/2 21:41,2010/9/4 6:55,33,MERGED,4,751,2,6,10,negative,2,-4

2778,Patch Set 1:This seem to hurt LT proxy design. I'm not certain how to handle this change too. So lets discuss some ideas.I think it should be designed as:1. Create a new interface org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.IRemoteConnection2. Provides an implementation of IRemoteConnection for local connections (org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.LocalConnection)3. Your RDTConnection goes to package org.eclipse.linuxtools.internal.rdt.proxy. It should implement the IRemoteConnection interface too.4. The method RDTConnection#getConnectionsName goes to org.eclipse.linuxtools.internal.rdt.proxy.RDTProxyManager. Perhaps it should return a list of IRemoteConnection instead of the connections name. Notice that RDTProxyManager has already a getConnection(uri) method5. Finally create a method in org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.RemoteProxyManager to return either LocalConnection or RDTConnection based upon the URI and/or IProject.Notice that org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch has already two classes about remote connection: RemoteConnection and RemoteConnectionException.

As the EMF implementation of the AOF represents all scalar features as IOnes, and as the IOne interface already provides a default value, it seemed useful to add an ""isDefault"" API to IOne in order to let clients know when the box's value is defaulted.  The EMF implementation of the IOne for scalar features takes account of the unset state and exposes it in this new API.

So you would add this open source module to your build.However you don't want to run the open source test cases as they would fail in the custom environment but you still want to execute the extended version so you don't want to skip al tests either.So the option is to simple skip the test cases for the tests.dsf.gdb bundle and leave it on for other tests bundles.

3124,"Patch Set 1:If the field is immutable (which means its contents cannot be modified, like Strings), a shallow copy is safe.In the case of a CtfLocation, the field type CtfLocationData is immutable. Its two fields are final. So another object having a pointer to the same object could not modify it, they'd have to create a new one.Although for TmfLocation, I agree there is no guarantee. We do not control all possible implementations, like with CtfLocation. I did add a comment in the Javadoc description, but it's probably not enough.I will re-spin the patch to do a deep-copy in TmfLocation. But I still think we can do a shallow-copy in CtfLocation, since we control CtfLocationData and we know it's immutable, and it'd be faster to do so.",1,15674,2012/8/15 14:28,2012/8/14 20:30,2012/8/14 21:00,0,ABANDONED,10,239,2,3,2,negative,2,-2

I like the fact that it's dead simple (if there's a conflict, it replaces with the new one. User's fault).

Also TmfRawEventViewer.refreshEventCount() should probably handle a null trace to set the thumb and refresh its display.Also, this clearing could be performed when executing the Delete command on a trace which is currently displayed, to allow the deletion to succeed.

Most stuff is already there.If a full ODF container is created, add SVG graphic to contained pictures folder and reference it. There is also the possibility that 'flat' ODF is required, in that case SVG would have to be added Base64 encoded where normally the link would be (AFAIR).Still, a bigger change...",1,9087,2015/12/11 15:11,2015/12/11 15:16,0,MERGED,3,11,3,13,2,positive

Also in ScFormulaCfg::ImplCommit() CONV_A1_XL_A1 is not handled.In sc/source/filter/oox/workbookhelper.cxx in WorkbookGlobals::initialize() has aCalcConfig.meStringRefAddressSyntax = getConvention(xDocProps); where getConvention() returns CONV_OOO if the generator was not Microsoft.

2812,"Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1The patch looks completely reasonable from the POV of the current state of the code. However, code archaeology suggests that merge commit 67d2af6fac2d9bad52a6b1f6e0cbd1229eb88a42 erroneously removed the call to ""ImplUpdate"" in MoveItem, since that line is present in BOTH parents of that merge. The ""if ( nNewPos < nPos )"" seems to be done for the sake of the ImplUpdate, to set the argument it will be called with. It looks reasonable, since the call is made with the default value of bDirect==false, then ImplUpdate updates *all* columns after its first argument (its argument inclusive). So it is essentially called with ::std::min(nPos, nNewPos).So it seems to me that we should rather fix the error in bd24a310be1459510b760b812838cb87923853c5 of using ""nPos"" instead of ""nNewPos"" in the second call of ::std::advance (the one before insert), but leave the ""if ( nNewPos < nPos )"" and reinsert the ""ImplUpdate(nPos, ...)"".Kendy, I know it is far away, but would you agree with my analysis of your merge commit?Julien, could you try out my suggestion above and test its effects, if the behaviour is good, the bug is still fixed, no other obvious bug is introduced, etc?

In some case it is useful to differentiate focusing caused by F6 or TAB. e.g. in BackingWindow::GetFocus(), GETFOCUS_F6 + !GETFOCUS_FORWARD -> grab focus to thumbnailview while GETFOCUS_TAB -> nothing> Also about removing if(GETFOCUS_TAB & GetGetFocusFlags()) - what now happens when you click there; won't it lead to extra focusing and unfocusing? Or is that unrelated?Yes, you are right. I will revert this change and will add a more explicit solution which will select item just when it is actually necessary. Unfortunately ImplGrabFocus() can't be used outside vcl, which would be a simple way (e.g. using ImplGrabFocus(GETFOCUS_F6) inside BackingWindow too).> The rest is nitpicking :-) - if we really need GETFOCUS_F6, it should be 0x0800, not 0x1000.Are you sure? I just look these GETFOCUS_ flags are defined in this way leaving out 0x0008, 0x0080 and I thought maybe somewhere these flags are used in a special way (e.g. some special bit operation) which makes it necessary.> PreNotify() should return true's, not 1's.Oh, yes.

12109,"Patch Set 1:Wrt. the starvation - actually that was due to the logging; we have so much debugging stuff that it was blocking considerably when writing to the console, making the queue grow.  Without that, all works fine even with the unmodified TileQueue :-)But I worked on the TileQueue too - it seems unnecessary to do all the priority shuffling when inserting, when the prioritization changes with every view switch, and instead do it only when the tile is requested - which seems to work nicely.Wrt. an own queue for tiles - that is exactly the thing that makes the synchronzation hard, as then it is necessary to synchronize between those 2 queues; which in turn kills all the advantage of 2 queues :-)Wrt. PNG compression; if we want to thread it, then let's thread just the compression - that'll make it local, more maintainable, and we can go with as many threads there as we wish (for just the PNG compression piece of code).Wrt. the 342125b8ea - thanks for that!

When reading a git log, it is useful to have a few details on the rationale behind a change: what problem are you solving, what approach youÔÇÖve followed to fix it, etc. Examples of good commit messages are in PoeditÔÇÖs repo, this is a random example: https://github.com/vslavik/poedit/commit/d6af8b16f386c92af4ad3107346990a57d92d4c5(Of course, you donÔÇÖt have to write novels out of commit messages, but most of the time a few explaining sentences are prefectly fine.)2. We have just (like a few days ago!) migrated to our own instance of Bugzilla (we used FreeDesktop.orgÔÇÖs one before), so thw way we refer to bugs has changed: instead of using the abbreviation ÔÇ£fdo#ÔÇØ we now use ÔÇ£tdf#ÔÇØ.Thanks again your your submission!",1,26678,2015/2/8 7:46,2015/2/8 7:46,0,ABANDONED,1,45,3,5,1,positive

13064,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1(1 comment)Hi Yogesh, thanks for looking into this.I was worried about the change to wrtw8sty.cxx so I had a bit of a look at the bug myself to understand it better.  I found two different issues which contribute:- the import from docx appears to have a bug which is at play here: when I open the docx in LibreOffice I see that the first page footer has wrong spacing. This affects the export code which tries to join chained page styles into a single word section if they match.  The import bug means that they do not match, so it will try to export this as two different word sections.- however some code recently added to ww8/ww8atr.cxx in a31fbb53dba7 prevents the output of a new section at the page break in this case, as the paragraph on the first page is empty             if( isTextNodeEmpty )                bNewPageDesc = false;So I think these are the two issues that need to be addressed, rather than the change proposed in this item.

I have a few comments however:It seems to me that using isalpha / isprint on string characters like this is a particularly horrible way to achieve this :-)To copy/paste a similar chunk of text twice like that is rather poor style - in programming for maintainability the aim is always to minimise the number of new lines we add: to maximise the sharing of lines of code etc.As such - I'd really strongly prefer as much of the if (rtl) { } cases to be shared with the non-rtl cases - can we not setup variables that alter the order of iteration / layout placement / rendering in advance and then use them in a shared block later ?When we do:+            // this code are for reverse the number of sildes in TitleThe title we have there seems to come from:void PresenterPaneBase::PaintBorder (const awt::Rectangle& rUpdateBox)...            mxBorderPainter->paintBorder(                mxPaneId->getResourceURL(),                mxBorderCanvas,                aLocalBorderBox,                rUpdateBox,                msTitle);msTitle - can we not translate translate and/or generate that msTitle (SetTitle?) in the first instance ?Is that created from a template in:void PresenterController::UpdatePaneTitles (void)if so - we should fix it there in just one place :-)That template prolly comes from the (localised?) configuration and just needs changing there ?Anyhow - thanks again for looking at this - with a few tweaks (as above) I think we can make it a lot sweeter.Thanks !",2,27906,2012/12/10 12:00,2012/12/11 5:02,17,ABANDONED,2,173,2,3,2,positive

13727,"Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisHi Mathias,first thanks for your patch. It is great start; Well, it does some non-standard things. I suggest to re-shufle it a bit :-)1. You already mentioned that you were unsure about    downloading the files inside configure. I suggest to   do it using the download script.   You might already see the many @FILENAME@ entries in   ooo.lst.in. They are optional. If you do not define such    variable in configure, it will be empty in the generated    ooo.lst file and it will not be downloaded.2. If you use download, it will get the files into the   $TARFILE_LOCATION instead of $SRC_ROOT/moz/zipped.      I suggest to modify the related makefiles in ""moz""    module to find the .zip archives in $TARFILE_LOCATION   Note that this approach follows the current trends.   In the past, we copied many 3rd party tarballs into   the related build subdirectories. We do not longer   do it. We already updated most makefiles to unpack the    tarballs directly from the $TARFILE_LOCATION.   3. I suggest to do not copy the dlls in configure because    it is not typical. Instead, I suggest to define variables   that will point to the files. Then you could copy the   files in the makefile that need to use the dlls.4. Please, do not remove the TABs from configure.in from    lines 4469-4515. These lines are copied into ""Makefile""    that is later tested. TABs are important in Makefiles,   so your change breaks this test.Thanks a lot for working on it.

142,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2 Verified+1Thanks for the contribution, Fred!  Even paying attention to copyright statements.This change certainly cuts neatly through a bunch of unnecessary and wonky code.  I was going to complain that changing the APIs in the UI classes from working with URIs to working with IResources results in a loss of generality, so that it would be more difficult to support exporting diagrams to the host filesystem (which is desperately needed, IMO) or other destinations, and that IResource is not even as appropriate a type as IContainer, but then I observed that the entire export infrastructure beneath the UI is all pinned to the IResource contract, anyways.  That, combined with the fact that any clients trying to use these UI bits would have had to construct nonsense URIs, means that I don't mind that this technically is an API-breaking change because that API was already non-functional and it will have to break again some time anyways to support exporting to non-workspace destinations.  Besides that none of these UI classes should ever have been exposed as API to begin with.All of which is to say thanks for working through the contribution process and do come back for more.",1,970,2016/10/13 21:08,2016/10/13 21:08,0,MERGED,5,118,4,5,1,negative

My only real comments:I think we should align the text used to match the Package Explorer: so 'Other Projects', rather than 'Other'.I think the different placement of Other, as compared to the Package Explorer, makes sense: the user has chosen to emphasize working sets, so projects that aren't in a working set are different.  But it's worth soliciting feedback from the users who strongly wanted this feature back.I think we should *always* show other projects in the Other category.  The menu item to enable this (""ÔÇªand show remaining projects in "") looks rather bizarre.  And I can't really think of a reason why you would to remove any other projects from view: the 'Other' is easy to ignore, and it helps to discover if there are projects that aren't included in other working sets (which happens to me periodically).",1,1107,2016/9/16 9:27,2016/9/16 9:27,0,MERGED,7,213,3,4,3,negative

I'm not aware of any way to make a SWT.WRAP viewer wrap only parts of its text.

1093,"Patch Set 3:This change is functional, but not entirely ""clean"" yet, for the following reasons:- The modification of the MANIFEST.MF and plugin.xml happens after the original EMF code generation. It would be cleaner to incorporate the necessary changes directly into the EMF code generation step somehow, instead of generating code and immediately patching it.- The XML modification completely changes the format of the XML file regarding white spaces, since it re-exports the entire DOM.- The detection of the correct files happens by checking whether the URI fits the format <something>/plugion.xml and <something>/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF. This happens by String equals() methods, I have not found a nicer solution for this, but it still seems awkward.- The icon for the editor entry is still hardcoded (I have not found a way to extract the icon from the data available at runtime).",3,4916,2015/10/21 14:10,2015/10/22 8:17,18,MERGED,4,347,4,8,3,negative

This allows new themes to control everything without side effects from older themes. Please note that we still have a few bugs in the reset stuff, e.g., Form controls do not all support the reset functionality.So in your case, if I switch from one theme to ""Something else"" all styling must be resetted to the default, e.g., preferences, colors, etc. As you are now argue this reset requirement away for the OS settings in this review, we also tried to argue that away for the preferences but this was strongly requested by the JDT team.",3,6922,2015/4/17 10:16,2015/4/17 10:16,0,MERGED,14,218,3,13,10,negative

I didn't get it, sorry.> For any given window, the perspective worked with the ActionSetManager to turn on or off actionSets (it seems to do it via the IContextService). It doesn't matter what the defaults were when the perspective was created, only that the perspective remember what actionSets are active at the moment.This is still true, but ActionSetManager (and also no one else) never persisted the ""disabled"" action sets as user choice. So you could request to show/hide them (depending on the application needs), but once user decides to get rid of some action set, this decision must ""override"" application choice. The best example is the debug action sett with the global debug buttons. In the old implementation you could try to ""hide"" them - but on next restart they will come back again, or, even worse, as soon as you hit a breakpoint - and this mean they will be back in a minute.

I think the model is overly complex now with ReviewItemSets, ReviewItems and File items.  Do we really need the ReviewItem element anymore?  To me the information it holds pretty much relates to the ReviewItemSet (i.e. Gerrit PatchSet) anyways, so why keep it?    I saw that you introduced a Change element as a Review superclass.  What is the rationale behind this?  Can't all the info be in a single Review EClass?  Insn't Change a little bit too Gerrit-specific?  Also, I noticed that review now has Change parents and childrens elements.  I suppose this is to take care of the Depends and Needs Changes in Gerrit to see dependencies accross reviews.  Am I right in this?    The TaskReference is gone from the Review, but is still in the ReviewGroup.  I am a little confused by this.  I thought that the REview itself was a Mylyn task, so now where is the link?  Also, why do we still have a taskReference at the Review Group level?  I don't think we need it.    The location right now is restricted to line ranges i.e. textual input.  This will eventually have to change if we want to support Model Reviews, where the ""location"" is not a line range.  This is okay for now but to keep in mind longer term.    ",3,11869,2013/4/10 23:53,2013/4/11 0:26,0,MERGED,88,10187,3,11,4,negative

However, this whole thing started out by some colleague (and me) being irritated by exactly such References. You do a Rebase, it finishes, and suddenly you have that ORIG_HEAD thing popping into your face from the HistoryView. Instead of the nice linear history you wanted to achieve by the Rebase, you suddenly have something looking very much like two branches....I think that turning the toggle into some Always/Unreferenced/Never switch would confuse the poor user too much. They would have some branch on a commit and no white label, but once the branch moves to the next commit, the white label would magically appear?So perhaps the solution to this could be to make the Additional Refs visible by default and put a button close to the ""Show All Branches"" button so that users can more easily suppress the Refs?

Equinox DS provides the osgi.extender capability since Neon M4. Now the e4 bundles can specify Require-Capability to that osgi.extender.

6119,Patch Set 1:This seem to hurt LT proxy design. I'm not certain how to handle this change too. So lets discuss some ideas.I think it should be designed as:1. Create a new interface org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.IRemoteConnection2. Provides an implementation of IRemoteConnection for local connections (org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.LocalConnection)3. Your RDTConnection goes to package org.eclipse.linuxtools.internal.rdt.proxy. It should implement the IRemoteConnection interface too.4. The method RDTConnection#getConnectionsName goes to org.eclipse.linuxtools.internal.rdt.proxy.RDTProxyManager. Perhaps it should return a list of IRemoteConnection instead of the connections name. Notice that RDTProxyManager has already a getConnection(uri) method5. Finally create a method in org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.RemoteProxyManager to return either LocalConnection or RDTConnection based upon the URI and/or IProject.Notice that org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch has already two classes about remote connection: RemoteConnection and RemoteConnectionException.

They are thrown away by the ViewRegistry, but shouldn't be.  This is a blocker, IMHO.  * I don't much like the category story, especially with how the ""general"" category is pulled out. But this is forced due to how our current model is built, where an MPartDescriptor's category is not the actual category id and the category is actually encoded as a tag (and hence not localizable?).  ViewRegistry should be fixed, but that doesn't have to be done as part of this work.  I'd at least like this category-finding code pulled out with a comment.  I wonder if we could use the MCategory for this purpose too.  * Change CapabilityFilter to know how to build an activity-style IIdentifier for model elements.

I spent a lot of effort in trying to bring EGit History display close to what gitk and git-log do. In order to do so whe can't always positon commits when they want to enter the list. We postpone the decision about the correct lane until we know enough. With your proposal this postponed positioning of some commits is gone - you position them when they enter the list. This leads to a display of the history graph which differs from native git and looks more ugly to me (that's a matter of taste, I know)Please look at the commit message of https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/4863/ which talks exactly about the situation you want to fix here.Here you see screenshots of what gitk, ""git log"", the current jgit (what is currently in master) and your proposal do to the history display of the repo from ""PlotCommitListTest.test2SideBranches()""- Gitk: http://i.imgur.com/t1iPKUS.png- git log: http://i.imgur.com/D6grQc9.png- current jgit: http://i.imgur.com/qARGRbq.png- your proposal: http://i.imgur.com/VQdHeRj.pngI'll see whether I can find a solution for the bug.

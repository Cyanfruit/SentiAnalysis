239,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1 Verified+1(1 comment)Hi Simon,thanks for the work! Looks good already! Just a few more thoughts on the pages below. Thanks a lot!Page Engines  * In the Configuration group for tab Match is some padding to the right and hence makes the min width larger then needed.  * The description area has a slightly different background than the rest (on my Linux box using GTK2). It has the right background in the post processor page and the item providers page.Page Filters  * I'd decrease min width a bit  * The description area has a slightly different background than the rest (on my Linux box using GTK2). It has the right background in the post processor page and the item providers page.  * The label ""Automatic behavior"" is misleading. Firstly, this label doesn't really mean a lot. Maybe something like ""Remember selected group"" would be better. Secondly, this preference is independent from the selected group/filter, still it is on the same level as the Description group, which is dependent on the selection. Maybe we should put the description and the list of filters into a group?Page Groups  * Label at the top has a larger margin to the list below than on previous pages.  * Same last two as for filtersItem Providers  * To be consistent with other pages in EMF Compare (e.g. post processors), it'd be good to have a brief label at the top.

2706,"Patch Set 2:(16 comments)Thanks for the valuable feedback!Regarding the distinction of C++11 attributes and GCC attributes: I left the GCC attributes as is and added the attribute specifiers for representing C++11 attributes. The distinction can be seen for example in the NodeWriter. If an I(CPP)ASTAttribute is encountered in a IASTAttributeOwner it is expected to be a GCC attribute. If an ICPPASTAttributeSpecifier is encountered there, it is expected to be a C++11 attribute. The previous implementation of attributes is a bit limiting regarding the capabilities required by C++11 attributes (scope and multiple attributes in one specifier).I also thought about a solution which introduces an attribute specifier for GCC attributes, but that would break the current API. It's related to the problem mentioned in my comment (Line 23) in ICPPASTAttributeSpecifier.",2,10251,2014/1/30 8:46,2014/2/26 12:06,651,MERGED,39,1681,3,6,10,positive

2973,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1(15 comments)Hi XavierVery nice addition! Our user will want that.Beside the inline commends I have two requests below. Please let me know what you think about it.Currently, there is no means to trigger the export command handler. I would suggest to add this to the TmfEventsTable Pop-up menu.Here how you could call the command handler in the method createPopupMenu() of the TmfEventsTable programmatically:final IAction exportToTextAction = new Action(""ExportToText"") {            @Override            public void run() {                IWorkbenchPage activePage = PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getActiveWorkbenchWindow().getActivePage();                IHandlerService handlerService = (IHandlerService) activePage.getActiveEditor().getSite().getService(IHandlerService.class);handlerService.executeCommand(""org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.exportToText"", null);            }        };tablePopupMenu.add(exportToTextAction);-------I also would like to ask you to change the format of the text file to match the columns in the table and instead of a hard-coded order of columns (which are actually the default TMF table columns). This you can achieve using methods extractFieldItems() of TmfEventsTable and getColumns() of the TmfVirtualTable instance which is a member of TmfEventsTable. You will need some public methods to access these information and pass a reference to the TmfEventsTable instance as command parameter.",1,10972,2013/10/28 9:09,2013/10/28 9:09,0,MERGED,7,322,2,3,5,positive

5178,"Patch Set 3:Ok, here's Round 2.  I think I hit all of the style issues from before, and addressed the commonBase problem we discussed.  I did it in a slightly different way than your suggestion, but I think it makes a little bit more sense given how the data comes into the generator.  Let me know if you see any problems with it.The generator should now return all commits up to the specified depth, ignoring any that were part of commonBase.  But it will correctly start returning any commits below the boundary of a previous shallow checkout, and return all commits at the old boundary as UNINTERESTING so that the PackWriter can exclude the right things from the pack.  As far as I can tell, this is correct behavior in all cases.I couldn't do the SEEN thing like I was planning on doing, because uninteresting commits get the flag set on them as well (as part of markStart()), so sometimes it's already present on commits in our queue even though we haven't added all their parents yet.  I reworked the depth stuff a bit and added some comments, hopefully making it clear enough that the depth sorting accomplishes the same thing.I'm cautiously optimistic that this is getting pretty close.  Please let me know if there's anything else that needs to be done to get this thing completely out the door.",3,12948,2010/7/27 3:39,2010/8/25 20:09,712,MERGED,5,529,3,12,12,positive

6239,"Patch Set 6:This looks like an interesting approach!The idea of returning the results in an arraylist was so that the view could then access each ""attribute"" in O(1) (since the attribute quark is the index in the array).But it's true that many views today don't really need quarks in particular, they look at the whole thing (or a relatively large subset of it). In that case they could handle the data as they receive it, in any order.If a view/analysis really wants to get the information ""the old way"", they can build the arraylist themselves and wait until all the data is available.Will look more deeply at it next.",6,14721,2013/12/12 6:35,2013/12/12 7:13,0,ABANDONED,7,189,3,5,7,positive

6310,Patch Set 10:(4 comments)Thanks Brian for the detailed review. One clarification question from my side: Do you think the support of model elements for the Activities should be handled with this change? It will to me that this should be handled by a separate bug and the dialog should be adjusted once this change is done or marked dependent on this change.,10,14982,2014/3/24 10:44,2014/4/23 16:22,725,ABANDONED,8,1220,4,14,21,positive

6340,"Patch Set 1: Verified-1 Code-Review-1irst of all: I think benchmarks are very useful. Said did already some stuff on this topic with respect to our content provider.  The JUnitBenchmark library looks very interesting at a first glance. However, in my opinion we should delay this patch to RMF 0.9.0, because:(1) the patch using JUnitBenchmarks requires at least junit 4.9. However, the current RMF target platform includes version 4.8.2 (which is part of the Eclipse JDT v.3.7.2). Plese note: Our current build is still based on eclipse 3.7 (indigo). Nevertheless, the orbit update site includes junit 4.10, which could be used as well.@ Fran├ºois: Do you use the RMF indigo target development definition?(2) Our plan is to build RMF 0.9.0 on top of Kepler. The Kepler update site includes a newer version of JDT as well as a newer version of Junit.(3) I guess, that the JUnitBenchmark library is not part of the Eclipse Orbit Project. As a consequence, we need a CQ for the library, especially for the customized version for working with OSGI. I think this should be no problem, since the library is only for testing/benchmark purposes.I will create a new bug entry covering this discussion.",1,15113,2013/7/30 14:30,2013/7/30 14:33,0,ABANDONED,5,28,2,2,1,positive

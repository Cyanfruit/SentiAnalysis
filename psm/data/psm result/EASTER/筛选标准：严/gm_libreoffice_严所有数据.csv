What do you think ?1. tpstatus label is obscured; not clearly visible. Maybe better if we add a background below this label, or something to make it visible clearly ?2. It should be possible to close the dialog when user clicks somewhere else. Currently, only way to close the dialog is to hit again on the toolbar button.3. I think we should limit the dimensions of table user can create with this new toolbar button just like we do in desktop, because if we don't it would stick to the mouse movements and user will have a hard time to find an empty space to close the dialog button. This is pretty annoying from user POV, I think.4. I noticed that the state of this new toolbar button doesn't get reset whenever user manages to close the dialog. So for eg: if user closed the dialog with table dimensions 12 x 12 selected, the next time he opens it, it would still be at 12 x 12. The state should be reset everytime dialog is closed.5. Currently, user has to move his mouse slowly to select desired dimensions. If he moves the mouse little faster, the dialog doesn't notice that.6. You have limited the width of dialog unlike its height. I think you intend to limit the number of columns user can choose here (?), _but_ if user moves his mouse back and forth near the right edge, more number of columns gets added to the same width increasing the number of cells per row - density - which makes the grid a mess. Can we somehow avoid that ? Also as pointed out in (3) limiting number of rows makes sense here.Besides these, I found a missing '+' (see inline comments which makes me suspect this is not the version you have in your local box since this version doesn't work out of the box unless someone changes code himself - is it ?)",2,5101,2016/5/1 12:07,2016/5/1 12:21,0,MERGED,3,99,2,5,3,negative

You need to update to a git checkout that ncludes the pushed patch already. One solution to avoid long recompile times is to have a separate push tree + charry-picking the commit from current master. Then only add the new commit to the push tree (which already contains the pushed commit) and push to gerrit for review.Gerrit complained that you tried to push a patch that has been merged already to gerrit review.

I tried that. And can give it another try. But it would require a much bigger change, obviously. The main problem is that wingdi.h is actually included from other windows headers too. So we can't fully control when it's included. But can give it another shot and narrow it down further. In fact, I spent hours trying to find what file includes the conflicting values to create this patch. > The current fix allows workdir/CustomTarget/officecfg/registry/officecfg/Office/Common.hxx > to be included, but if a source file happens to first include that > officecfg/Office/Common.hxx, then include wingdi.h, and later wants > to acutally use the struct RGB from Common.hxx, it still runs into > a problem.Well, that would be be a problem _only_ if wingdi.h was already included _before_ Office/Common.h, and in that case the build would fail because the macro would conflict with the declaration of RGB (my patch avoids this situation).However, if wingdi.h was _not_ included at the point of #undef RGB, then nothing bad would happen if it is included afterwards. Unless I missed something, I don't see how there would still be a problem, as wingdi.h will define RGB without issue.I should add that I hated this particular line of my patch.

1785,"Patch Set 6:Norbert, thanks for CCing me. Although I'm being added after this is merged...On the one hand, I'm not happy about the lost features, which to my eye are somewhat important. Ironically, I don't think they are important for Base itself, but more for the services that Base provides to other components: namely the capacity for Writer to do mail merges on Outlook, Outlook Express, Thunderbird and LDAP address books (on Windows 32 bit).Oh the other hand, I understand and see that this whole old precompiled binary mozilla thing is a monstrosity that cannot continue indefinitely, in addition of being against our FLOSS principles. The timing of this instigates doubt that one of the reasons is to level down the Win32 and Win64 versions to the same feature set.As to ""could be rewritten from scratch"", yes, it could; the absence of activity on bugs 56903 56905 and 57322 suggests that we don't have the volunteer manpower to do that. Maybe leaving the glaring difference between the Win32 and Win64 builds would have brought some energy, who knows.Why do two files in connectivity/source/drivers/mozab/bootstrap survive?",6,9515,2015/10/23 16:39,2015/10/25 15:02,46,MERGED,113,15462,5,7,6,negative

See ::TRGetBaseGeometry implementations where the mirroring is coming from - e.g in SdrObjCustomShape it *is* a model member (X and Y).Currently - except for the SdrObjCustomShape and SdrGrafObj - the mirrored states are not preserved - the mirroring is geometrically *executed* on the existing geometry, that's it (aw080 changes this).You can see this sad truth e.g. at the graphic object - insert one in Draw/Impress and add text. Hor mirror does not change the text at all, vertical mirror uses a 180 deg rotation, *not* a true vert mirroring.This only does not come to more attention due to the fact that nearly all shapes are CustomShapes nowadays...Do not forget: mirror in X and Y equals a 180 deg rotation (can be seen/proved looking at the corrresponding homogen matrix)",4,9572,2015/11/22 6:04,2015/11/23 14:27,32,MERGED,3,41,3,5,5,negative

As such, it should be stored in ScDPSaveDimension as a new boolean member, not in ScDPSaveData, which should only store table-wide options.3) ODF export code should also reflect that, and store the new setting as a dimension attribute.  Right now you are saving it as a table attribute, which is wrong.  I didn't check your change in the import code, but I'd guess it has a similar issue.I did check Excel once again.

2812,"Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1The patch looks completely reasonable from the POV of the current state of the code. However, code archaeology suggests that merge commit 67d2af6fac2d9bad52a6b1f6e0cbd1229eb88a42 erroneously removed the call to ""ImplUpdate"" in MoveItem, since that line is present in BOTH parents of that merge. The ""if ( nNewPos < nPos )"" seems to be done for the sake of the ImplUpdate, to set the argument it will be called with. It looks reasonable, since the call is made with the default value of bDirect==false, then ImplUpdate updates *all* columns after its first argument (its argument inclusive). So it is essentially called with ::std::min(nPos, nNewPos).So it seems to me that we should rather fix the error in bd24a310be1459510b760b812838cb87923853c5 of using ""nPos"" instead of ""nNewPos"" in the second call of ::std::advance (the one before insert), but leave the ""if ( nNewPos < nPos )"" and reinsert the ""ImplUpdate(nPos, ...)"".Kendy, I know it is far away, but would you agree with my analysis of your merge commit?Julien, could you try out my suggestion above and test its effects, if the behaviour is good, the bug is still fixed, no other obvious bug is introduced, etc?

So, I just react to the comments.If this patch causes that Draw behaves different way when pasting from Writer and Draw then it is even less intuitive that the previous behavior and I suggest to revert it.IMHO, it should not matter where you paste from. Also all LO appications should handle the pasting the same way.When I think about it, the confusion might be in the definition of selected object. If you select part of text in Writer and paste something, the selected text is overwritten, so writer behaves the same way as Draw.The problem is that in Writer, if no test is selected, the cursor is somewhere between two characters and pasted text is added. No text is selected most of the time when you write a text. You need to do explict action (select the text) to overwrite it.In draw, the last added or edited object is always selected, so most of the time some object is selected. This causes that the last object is overwritten when pasting. You need to do explicit action (deselect the object) to avoid overwriting.To be honest I am not sure how to solve this.PS: I am sorry if I added the comment a wrong way. I am not familiar with the current Gerrint interface. I did not find any way how to replay any existing comment.",2,18336,2013/9/7 12:00,2014/5/15 21:39,6009,MERGED,1,8,3,6,2,negative

Without that, all works fine even with the unmodified TileQueue :-)But I worked on the TileQueue too - it seems unnecessary to do all the priority shuffling when inserting, when the prioritization changes with every view switch, and instead do it only when the tile is requested - which seems to work nicely.Wrt. an own queue for tiles - that is exactly the thing that makes the synchronzation hard, as then it is necessary to synchronize between those 2 queues; which in turn kills all the advantage of 2 queues :-)Wrt. PNG compression; if we want to thread it, then let's thread just the compression - that'll make it local, more maintainable, and we can go with as many threads there as we wish (for just the PNG compression piece of code).Wrt. the 342125b8ea - thanks for that!

On the other hand I don't know about use cases where the current behaviour makes sense. What is the point of having a sentence saying something like: ""Further comments on page <pagefield + n>.""? If the page exists I would prefer references and if it doesn't what should the empty page field tell me then?Jason is right that changing page numbers is not an easy thing to do. But using offsets makes things worse. They don't help in a table of contents, with references, ...Removing the offset feature is probably also not an option, because it's a part of ODF standard.But before integrating the 'deprecated' Expand(...) method should be removed.",6,25235,2016/5/27 3:27,2016/5/28 21:12,41,ABANDONED,3,74,6,11,6,negative

A footer is just the most common instance (at which point, the one instance of the page number is offset on all footers because of the footer's functionality, not the page number's functionality).Whether we eventually abandon this or not (see immediately prior comment), I'll address your inline comment.

I was a bit upset that the headless patch was merged even though the ESC asked the author not to merge it in its current form. The opengl situation on our Android port is a bit unclear. On one hand, we disable opengl in configure, OTOH it seems we build most of the opengl code in vcl. My commit just restored that status quo, fixing the build. I also verified that the build result actually works. :-)Given that at the end Android uses cairo to render the tiles, the opengl code is not useful on Android. However, probably it's a good idea to not work on removing it from the Android binary till it's not clear if those opengl #ifdefs will go away or not in the long run. (Currently we have those ifdefs, but it's possible they will be reverted, it's not clear yet.)",1,25623,2016/3/29 21:59,2016/3/29 22:36,0,ABANDONED,1,2,5,10,1,negative

Currently all our tests don't have access to the UI configuration as it breaks the tests. Now I don't remember why I went the way of pointing the ui path to the user profile but it still seems to be necessary. Back when I wrote that code there were however no UI files so it was still so that the whole UI should have worked. Now with the UI files this is no longer true and pointing the UI config path to a place that does not the UI files causes an exception and later a crash.I will need some time to get back into the details of the configuration management during the tests.,1,25668,2016/3/21 14:48,2016/3/21 14:48,0,ABANDONED,3,60,3,7,2,negative

13064,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1(1 comment)Hi Yogesh, thanks for looking into this.I was worried about the change to wrtw8sty.cxx so I had a bit of a look at the bug myself to understand it better.  I found two different issues which contribute:- the import from docx appears to have a bug which is at play here: when I open the docx in LibreOffice I see that the first page footer has wrong spacing. This affects the export code which tries to join chained page styles into a single word section if they match.  The import bug means that they do not match, so it will try to export this as two different word sections.- however some code recently added to ww8/ww8atr.cxx in a31fbb53dba7 prevents the output of a new section at the page break in this case, as the paragraph on the first page is empty             if( isTextNodeEmpty )                bNewPageDesc = false;So I think these are the two issues that need to be addressed, rather than the change proposed in this item.

13727,"Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisHi Mathias,first thanks for your patch. It is great start; Well, it does some non-standard things. I suggest to re-shufle it a bit :-)1. You already mentioned that you were unsure about    downloading the files inside configure. I suggest to   do it using the download script.   You might already see the many @FILENAME@ entries in   ooo.lst.in. They are optional. If you do not define such    variable in configure, it will be empty in the generated    ooo.lst file and it will not be downloaded.2. If you use download, it will get the files into the   $TARFILE_LOCATION instead of $SRC_ROOT/moz/zipped.      I suggest to modify the related makefiles in ""moz""    module to find the .zip archives in $TARFILE_LOCATION   Note that this approach follows the current trends.   In the past, we copied many 3rd party tarballs into   the related build subdirectories. We do not longer   do it. We already updated most makefiles to unpack the    tarballs directly from the $TARFILE_LOCATION.   3. I suggest to do not copy the dlls in configure because    it is not typical. Instead, I suggest to define variables   that will point to the files. Then you could copy the   files in the makefile that need to use the dlls.4. Please, do not remove the TABs from configure.in from    lines 4469-4515. These lines are copied into ""Makefile""    that is later tested. TABs are important in Makefiles,   so your change breaks this test.Thanks a lot for working on it.

13736,"Patch Set 1: Do not submitHmm, I am confused by all the changes:1. In the dmake fix, it does not make sense to save   the number of read items and just increment it.      Instead, it would make sense to check if it really   did read the item, for example:      if (fread( (char *)&flhdr, sizeof(flhdr), 1, f ) != 1) return (-1);   2. In the lpsolve fix, it is not a good idea to redirect all   error messages to /dev/null. It would hide real build   errors as well.      Instead, it would be better to fix the lpsolve code   to do not produce warnigns at all.3. The concat-deps.c is strange as well. It is a similar   problem like in dmake.      IMHO, we need to return an error if it does not write   the whole item => you need to modify the function   print_fullpaths to return integer instead of void.   Then you could use something like:      if (fwrite(token, token_len, 1, stdout) != 1) return EIO;      Of course, you need to handle the print_fullpaths return   value where it is called.",1,27966,2012/10/18 23:44,2012/10/18 23:44,0,ABANDONED,3,21,2,2,3,negative

You could use     git rebase -i origin/master   and follow the instructions2. You patch hides potential errors using thatif( function_call(...) ) ; construct .

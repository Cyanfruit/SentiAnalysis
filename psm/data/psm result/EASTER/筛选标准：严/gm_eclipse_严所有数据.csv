142,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2 Verified+1Thanks for the contribution, Fred!  Even paying attention to copyright statements.This change certainly cuts neatly through a bunch of unnecessary and wonky code.  I was going to complain that changing the APIs in the UI classes from working with URIs to working with IResources results in a loss of generality, so that it would be more difficult to support exporting diagrams to the host filesystem (which is desperately needed, IMO) or other destinations, and that IResource is not even as appropriate a type as IContainer, but then I observed that the entire export infrastructure beneath the UI is all pinned to the IResource contract, anyways.  That, combined with the fact that any clients trying to use these UI bits would have had to construct nonsense URIs, means that I don't mind that this technically is an API-breaking change because that API was already non-functional and it will have to break again some time anyways to support exporting to non-workspace destinations.  Besides that none of these UI classes should ever have been exposed as API to begin with.All of which is to say thanks for working through the contribution process and do come back for more.",1,970,2016/10/13 21:08,2016/10/13 21:08,0,MERGED,5,118,4,5,1,negative

But it's worth soliciting feedback from the users who strongly wanted this feature back.I think we should *always* show other projects in the Other category.  The menu item to enable this (""ÔÇªand show remaining projects in "") looks rather bizarre.  And I can't really think of a reason why you would to remove any other projects from view: the 'Other' is easy to ignore, and it helps to discover if there are projects that aren't included in other working sets (which happens to me periodically).",1,1107,2016/9/16 9:27,2016/9/16 9:27,0,MERGED,7,213,3,4,3,negative

It has the right background in the post processor page and the item providers page.Page Filters  * I'd decrease min width a bit  * The description area has a slightly different background than the rest (on my Linux box using GTK2). It has the right background in the post processor page and the item providers page.  * The label ""Automatic behavior"" is misleading. Firstly, this label doesn't really mean a lot. Maybe something like ""Remember selected group"" would be better. Secondly, this preference is independent from the selected group/filter, still it is on the same level as the Description group, which is dependent on the selection. Maybe we should put the description and the list of filters into a group?Page Groups  * Label at the top has a larger margin to the list below than on previous pages.  * Same last two as for filtersItem Providers  * To be consistent with other pages in EMF Compare (e.g. post processors), it'd be good to have a brief label at the top. E.g.: ""Select active item providers used in the comparison editor:""",1,1324,2016/6/30 14:55,2016/6/30 14:55,0,MERGED,9,134,3,4,9,positive

If you switch from theme A to B, everything would be set to ""default"" and afterwards everything would be styled accordingly to B. This allows new themes to control everything without side effects from older themes. Please note that we still have a few bugs in the reset stuff, e.g., Form controls do not all support the reset functionality.So in your case, if I switch from one theme to ""Something else"" all styling must be resetted to the default, e.g., preferences, colors, etc. As you are now argue this reset requirement away for the OS settings in this review, we also tried to argue that away for the preferences but this was strongly requested by the JDT team.",3,6922,2015/4/17 10:16,2015/4/17 10:16,0,MERGED,14,218,3,13,10,negative

Consequently, both rules in this example have the same effect, which includes the removing and adding of the Player at a different place in the containment hierarchy (potentially a different model instance). However, B does not indicate this effect in the graphical syntax, which makes it difficult for the developer to understand the meaning of this rule.In a small example, the maintainability drawback might not be too drastic.

I'd say the content aspect (the one now used in the BASE_ASPECTS) should be called TmfContentAspect (or TmfEventContentAspect?) And TmfEventFieldAspect should remain the ""singular"" one.The contents of https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/38512/6 are touched again by this patch. They could be squashed together, or maybe put that one after this patch here, since it will add the code directly in the correct class.Changing some inner classes to constructor calls is unrelated to the rest of the patch. I do agree it is better, but it adds noise to this patch, should be done separately.",5,7722,2015/1/20 20:19,2015/1/30 20:20,240,MERGED,27,530,3,8,8,positive

Or the unholy mess that is CtfTmfEventField. Those just cram the event information into the ITmfEventField format, and they don't even have to anymore.That aside, we won't realistically get rid of ITmfEventField any time soon. But I really think this is something we should strive to.I'm also a bit skeptical about the usefulness of typing manually field paths with slashes. How would the user know which fields actually exist? Is it useful to someone other than those who wrote the parser? A big advantage of aspects is discoverability, it can tell the user which information exists for an event.

It is not moving but adding the persistence layer.> Is it just the regular mechanism is disconnected? I didn't get it, sorry.> For any given window, the perspective worked with the ActionSetManager to turn on or off actionSets (it seems to do it via the IContextService). It doesn't matter what the defaults were when the perspective was created, only that the perspective remember what actionSets are active at the moment.This is still true, but ActionSetManager (and also no one else) never persisted the ""disabled"" action sets as user choice. So you could request to show/hide them (depending on the application needs), but once user decides to get rid of some action set, this decision must ""override"" application choice. The best example is the debug action sett with the global debug buttons. In the old implementation you could try to ""hide"" them - but on next restart they will come back again, or, even worse, as soon as you hit a breakpoint - and this mean they will be back in a minute. See the nice comment about it in the LaunchView (written *before* the big e4 changes), line 1442:			// When the launch view becomes visible, turn on the			// debug action set.

It can not be called from getRemoteUIServices/getUIServices/RemoteUIServicesDescriptor.loadServices because those are not guaranteed to be called before the core service is used.

2563,"Patch Set 13: Code-Review-1(1 comment)One more comment, then about the ""size"" discussion:- There are still some size() methods with no comments whatsoever.- I don't like size(), it's easy to confuse with Collections.size(). For public methods in specific objects, you could have getPacketSize(), getResponseSize() etc. IFixedSize is unnecessary.- Having some private methods where size() actually means something different (only first packet) is crazy design. You know today, but 2 months from now nobody will remember, and we'll have lots of fun debugging size problems. Specific methods names, like sizeOfFirstPacket() etc. would be safer.- If there is no interface, then the methods can be static (if the size is constant, of course). If it's static, it should be a public static final int, not a method. Methods should be only where the size can vary from one object to another.",13,9870,2014/4/18 18:11,2014/4/22 23:09,100,MERGED,44,2874,2,4,21,negative

2706,"Patch Set 2:(16 comments)Thanks for the valuable feedback!Regarding the distinction of C++11 attributes and GCC attributes: I left the GCC attributes as is and added the attribute specifiers for representing C++11 attributes. The distinction can be seen for example in the NodeWriter. If an I(CPP)ASTAttribute is encountered in a IASTAttributeOwner it is expected to be a GCC attribute. If an ICPPASTAttributeSpecifier is encountered there, it is expected to be a C++11 attribute. The previous implementation of attributes is a bit limiting regarding the capabilities required by C++11 attributes (scope and multiple attributes in one specifier).I also thought about a solution which introduces an attribute specifier for GCC attributes, but that would break the current API.

Please let me know what you think about it.Currently, there is no means to trigger the export command handler. I would suggest to add this to the TmfEventsTable Pop-up menu.Here how you could call the command handler in the method createPopupMenu() of the TmfEventsTable programmatically:final IAction exportToTextAction = new Action(""ExportToText"") {            @Override            public void run() {                IWorkbenchPage activePage = PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getActiveWorkbenchWindow().getActivePage();                IHandlerService handlerService = (IHandlerService) activePage.getActiveEditor().getSite().getService(IHandlerService.class);handlerService.executeCommand(""org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.exportToText"", null);            }        };tablePopupMenu.add(exportToTextAction);-------I also would like to ask you to change the format of the text file to match the columns in the table and instead of a hard-coded order of columns (which are actually the default TMF table columns). This you can achieve using methods extractFieldItems() of TmfEventsTable and getColumns() of the TmfVirtualTable instance which is a member of TmfEventsTable. You will need some public methods to access these information and pass a reference to the TmfEventsTable instance as command parameter.",1,10972,2013/10/28 9:09,2013/10/28 9:09,0,MERGED,7,322,2,3,5,positive

Nothing wrong with that, but we will have to update them when we do the EMF edit part.  Finally I'm having a few observations/questions on the model:    For the Approval and Requirements, I think the model is generic enough, although I never worked with requirements in Gerrit and I'm not sure how they work really.    I think the model is overly complex now with ReviewItemSets, ReviewItems and File items.  Do we really need the ReviewItem element anymore?  To me the information it holds pretty much relates to the ReviewItemSet (i.e. Gerrit PatchSet) anyways, so why keep it?    I saw that you introduced a Change element as a Review superclass.  What is the rationale behind this?  Can't all the info be in a single Review EClass?  Insn't Change a little bit too Gerrit-specific?  Also, I noticed that review now has Change parents and childrens elements.  I suppose this is to take care of the Depends and Needs Changes in Gerrit to see dependencies accross reviews.  Am I right in this?    The TaskReference is gone from the Review, but is still in the ReviewGroup.  I am a little confused by this.  I thought that the REview itself was a Mylyn task, so now where is the link?  Also, why do we still have a taskReference at the Review Group level?  I don't think we need it.    The location right now is restricted to line ranges i.e. textual input.  This will eventually have to change if we want to support Model Reviews, where the ""location"" is not a line range.  This is okay for now but to keep in mind longer term.    ",3,11869,2013/4/10 23:53,2013/4/11 0:26,0,MERGED,88,10187,3,11,4,negative

However, this whole thing started out by some colleague (and me) being irritated by exactly such References. You do a Rebase, it finishes, and suddenly you have that ORIG_HEAD thing popping into your face from the HistoryView. Instead of the nice linear history you wanted to achieve by the Rebase, you suddenly have something looking very much like two branches....I think that turning the toggle into some Always/Unreferenced/Never switch would confuse the poor user too much. They would have some branch on a commit and no white label, but once the branch moves to the next commit, the white label would magically appear?So perhaps the solution to this could be to make the Additional Refs visible by default and put a button close to the ""Show All Branches"" button so that users can more easily suppress the Refs?

I did it in a slightly different way than your suggestion, but I think it makes a little bit more sense given how the data comes into the generator.  Let me know if you see any problems with it.The generator should now return all commits up to the specified depth, ignoring any that were part of commonBase.  But it will correctly start returning any commits below the boundary of a previous shallow checkout, and return all commits at the old boundary as UNINTERESTING so that the PackWriter can exclude the right things from the pack.  As far as I can tell, this is correct behavior in all cases.I couldn't do the SEEN thing like I was planning on doing, because uninteresting commits get the flag set on them as well (as part of markStart()), so sometimes it's already present on commits in our queue even though we haven't added all their parents yet.  I reworked the depth stuff a bit and added some comments, hopefully making it clear enough that the depth sorting accomplishes the same thing.I'm cautiously optimistic that this is getting pretty close.

6119,Patch Set 1:This seem to hurt LT proxy design. I'm not certain how to handle this change too. So lets discuss some ideas.I think it should be designed as:1. Create a new interface org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.IRemoteConnection2. Provides an implementation of IRemoteConnection for local connections (org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.LocalConnection)3. Your RDTConnection goes to package org.eclipse.linuxtools.internal.rdt.proxy. It should implement the IRemoteConnection interface too.4. The method RDTConnection#getConnectionsName goes to org.eclipse.linuxtools.internal.rdt.proxy.RDTProxyManager. Perhaps it should return a list of IRemoteConnection instead of the connections name. Notice that RDTProxyManager has already a getConnection(uri) method5. Finally create a method in org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.RemoteProxyManager to return either LocalConnection or RDTConnection based upon the URI and/or IProject.Notice that org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch has already two classes about remote connection: RemoteConnection and RemoteConnectionException. They doesn't fit in current LT proxy design but I am not sure how to deal with it... :(,1,14238,2015/10/20 18:20,2015/10/20 18:20,0,ABANDONED,12,292,3,4,3,negative

But this is forced due to how our current model is built, where an MPartDescriptor's category is not the actual category id and the category is actually encoded as a tag (and hence not localizable?).  ViewRegistry should be fixed, but that doesn't have to be done as part of this work.  I'd at least like this category-finding code pulled out with a comment.  I wonder if we could use the MCategory for this purpose too.  * Change CapabilityFilter to know how to build an activity-style IIdentifier for model elements.

The JUnitBenchmark library looks very interesting at a first glance.

However, the current RMF target platform includes version 4.8.2 (which is part of the Eclipse JDT v.3.7.2). Plese note: Our current build is still based on eclipse 3.7 (indigo). Nevertheless, the orbit update site includes junit 4.10, which could be used as well.@ Fran├ºois: Do you use the RMF indigo target development definition?(2) Our plan is to build RMF 0.9.0 on top of Kepler. The Kepler update site includes a newer version of JDT as well as a newer version of Junit.(3) I guess, that the JUnitBenchmark library is not part of the Eclipse Orbit Project.

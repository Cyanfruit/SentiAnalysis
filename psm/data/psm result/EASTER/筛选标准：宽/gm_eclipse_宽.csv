206,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2 Verified+1Thanks for the contribution, Fred!  Even paying attention to copyright statements.This change certainly cuts neatly through a bunch of unnecessary and wonky code.  I was going to complain that changing the APIs in the UI classes from working with URIs to working with IResources results in a loss of generality, so that it would be more difficult to support exporting diagrams to the host filesystem (which is desperately needed, IMO) or other destinations, and that IResource is not even as appropriate a type as IContainer, but then I observed that the entire export infrastructure beneath the UI is all pinned to the IResource contract, anyways.  That, combined with the fact that any clients trying to use these UI bits would have had to construct nonsense URIs, means that I don't mind that this technically is an API-breaking change because that API was already non-functional and it will have to break again some time anyways to support exporting to non-workspace destinations.  Besides that none of these UI classes should ever have been exposed as API to begin with.All of which is to say thanks for working through the contribution process and do come back for more.",1,970,2016/10/13 21:08,2016/10/13 21:08,0,MERGED,5,118,4,5,1,1

My only real comments:I think we should align the text used to match the Package Explorer: so 'Other Projects', rather than 'Other'.I think the different placement of Other, as compared to the Package Explorer, makes sense: the user has chosen to emphasize working sets, so projects that aren't in a working set are different.  But it's worth soliciting feedback from the users who strongly wanted this feature back.I think we should *always* show other projects in the Other category.  The menu item to enable this (""ÔÇªand show remaining projects in "") looks rather bizarre.  And I can't really think of a reason why you would to remove any other projects from view: the 'Other' is easy to ignore, and it helps to discover if there are projects that aren't included in other working sets (which happens to me periodically).",1,1107,2016/9/16 9:27,2016/9/16 9:27,0,MERGED,7,213,3,4,3,1

I've tested it with GTK2 and GTK3 and it's the same. I don't see any abnormal indent.Concerning ""Remember selected filters"" in filters preference page it does not seems to be the same for the two tabs. Is it normal or these two tabs should have this option? For the Groups preference page it will be possible to move this field above the tabs, but it will be more consistent if the filters and the groups have the same layout.",6,1324,2016/6/30 14:55,2016/8/22 14:28,1271,MERGED,10,211,3,5,9,0
351,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1 Verified+1(1 comment)Hi Simon,thanks for the work! Looks good already! Just a few more thoughts on the pages below. Thanks a lot!Page Engines  * In the Configuration group for tab Match is some padding to the right and hence makes the min width larger then needed.  * The description area has a slightly different background than the rest (on my Linux box using GTK2). It has the right background in the post processor page and the item providers page.Page Filters  * I'd decrease min width a bit  * The description area has a slightly different background than the rest (on my Linux box using GTK2). It has the right background in the post processor page and the item providers page.  * The label ""Automatic behavior"" is misleading. Firstly, this label doesn't really mean a lot. Maybe something like ""Remember selected group"" would be better. Secondly, this preference is independent from the selected group/filter, still it is on the same level as the Description group, which is dependent on the selection. Maybe we should put the description and the list of filters into a group?Page Groups  * Label at the top has a larger margin to the list below than on previous pages.  * Same last two as for filtersItem Providers  * To be consistent with other pages in EMF Compare (e.g. post processors), it'd be good to have a brief label at the top. E.g.: ""Select active item providers used in the comparison editor:""",1,1324,2016/6/30 14:55,2016/6/30 14:55,0,MERGED,9,134,3,4,9,0

Maybe something like ""Remember selected group"" would be better.And in addition I found another minor thing:  * When opening the item providers page, there is no item provider selected automatically, which leaves the description empty -- and this looks a bit strange.

There was a contribution about this in the past, but it didn't work that time because p2 doesn't support OSGi capabilities.

There are some bundles in neon which can't be unpacked by Java 7's unpack200 since they have been packed using Java 8 and Java 7 is unable to unpack them and p2 is too dumb to use the corresponding jar as a fallback :-(I switched back the egit.gerrit job to use Java 7 and retriggered the buildI am now first trying to find the cause for the problems I currently face with running egit core tests from maven (also using mars target platform).

I'm testing on GTK3.18 and it doesn't work, but when I test on 3.14 it does. Is it possible your system GTK is below 3.16?",3,3167,2016/3/31 13:36,2016/4/1 15:20,25,MERGED,1,11,3,6,6,0

The difference is what the default is if the string is missing in the configuration. If there is no configuration then the settings.getBoolean() will return false (IIRC) which means that you can't tell the difference between someone who hasn't set this value and someone who has explicitly disabled the setting. In fact I think this will have the opposite behaviour in that skipGeneration will now explicitly be false and thus always generate it in the case of a missing value. At least that is the case if getBoolean returns a boolean (as opposed to a Boolean). That said if you've tested it and done all the cases (running with a clean workbench without Oomph modifying the setting behind your back, checking the default works of not set, it persists once you have set it etc.) then I'm happy to withdraw my -1",8,3274,2015/9/23 21:58,2016/3/24 9:09,4379,MERGED,1,14,3,5,12,0

1148,"Patch Set 3:> Jonah, I have tried to follow the history of this patch, to > complete it according to your suggestions. Can you have a quick > look at see if what I did looks ok? >  > I am not sure if you thought that we should deprecate more than I > did?(I don't have access to my main dev machine right now, so I can't properly verify the following, I will later today)For me the one that is not there is the org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote.tabs.RemoteCMainTab, which is still (correctly) referenced by plugin.xml. The problem is that tab and org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote.tabs.RemoteCDSFMainTab do the same thing, but the latter for debug and the former for run. With the two different tabs for Main we end up in this situation that if you open Debug or Run launch ui, you end up with different UI on screen. I can better explain (with a screenshot if needed) when I get back to my desk.BTW if we don't deprecate RemoteCMainTab, we should not deprecate org.eclipse.cdt.launch.ui.CMainTab either. Final note, what I meant by:>  I don't think I will have time before M6/API freeze to rework this properly.is that I won't have time to refactor/review the code to be able to simply remove CMainTab and all children (including RemoteCMainTab) as that removal needs further updating the plugin.xml.

1201,"Patch Set 7:> ""allowNulls"", the design of the state system is that there should be no null values when returning from a query. It's not explicitely enforced in the backends' runtime code, but it could be. Testing this means testing cases that are not supposed to happen.When used along with a StateSystem, the query does not return null because the StateSystem first fills the interval list with a subset of the intervals and the backend fills it with the remaining subset, and both subsets complete each other and are mutually exclusive. So it is perfectly valid and expected in our runtime implementation that a backend does not fill some of the elements in the interval list. I could easily foresee test cases asserting that some elements must be null in the result of a query. These assertions could be checked after executing testDoQuery() which should therefore complete without failing.> The two ""abstract"" methods (getBackendForBuilding/getBackendForQuerying). The concept of ""reopening"" only applies to the HistoryTreeBackend, this notion should remain in that test class, not in the -Base. Parameters and the ""reopen"" constructor parameter is a nice way to offer both alternatives.Any backend could support reopening and then should override getBackendForQuerying(). Those backends that don't support it don't have to do anything. I think this is perfectly fine. My solution has the advantage to reduce code duplication. In the context of unit test code, I believe this is more important than conceptual considerations.> The abstract method I'm suggesting tells the implementation to ""create a backend and insert these intervals"". This is a clear initialization step.This clear initialization method is implemented in a final protected method that performs these steps in the base class in my patch. I think it is much better.> The pattern of an abstract method to set a protected field is used in other tests. It should be kept as consistent as possible.I hope you are not suggesting that forcing all subclasses to implement a method that can more easily be provided by the base class is preferable for reasons of consistency.I therefore respectfully disagree with your remaining objections. I think this patch is now way, way above the review threshold for unit test code.

Having both the -Base and a HistoryTreeBackendTest separates nicely what is specific to all backends (like the backend fixture), while HistoryTreeBackendTest owns what is specific to that backend, like the temp file.Good idea about splitting testDoQuery too, it will make it easy to re-use for different interval sets.I'd keep InMemoryBackendTest for another patch. We could move the tests in that class into the new base class to have them run on other backends.I'd also prefer to stick it to one abstract class that sets the backend. This pattern is used in other test classes in the tree. Each test would have to run prepareBackend(something), but then they don't have to worry about disposing it.New patchset inc.",4,3467,2016/1/6 23:38,2016/1/14 21:54,190,MERGED,4,323,4,8,13,0

To do that, we make individual masks. A mask is a simple 1 shifted to the right position. Then you BITWISE and function between the said mask and the value. If this is 0, it means the bit was not present.I will update the commit message with an example, but I don't want to be this verbose in there unless you think it's necessary.",1,3557,2016/1/25 21:02,2016/1/25 21:12,0,MERGED,1,34,3,6,3,0

You must have a fix that is not in the git repo as I am seeing multiple entries appearing stacked for the image id as before.  The full repo/tag is shown for each tag.  If I have an image with 6 tags for the fedora repo let's say I see this in a single fat row where the repo tags column has 6 entries on top of each other.  If I then add a new tag: jjohnstn/fedora:latest, I see 7 repo tags for the image id, but I also get a repeat of the image id where again I see 7 repo tags for the image id.

I suppose, the names were chosen before support for camel case matching was added. For now, I have updated Javadoc to reflect how validation is done but have not touched the method names since that change would affect subclasses as well. However, I consider that renaming these methods to isValidToken() and isMatching() is something similar would make their roles more clear to future contributors.",12,4800,2015/7/14 13:11,2015/8/21 20:24,919,MERGED,4,62,3,5,15,1

1654,"Patch Set 3:This change is functional, but not entirely ""clean"" yet, for the following reasons:- The modification of the MANIFEST.MF and plugin.xml happens after the original EMF code generation. It would be cleaner to incorporate the necessary changes directly into the EMF code generation step somehow, instead of generating code and immediately patching it.- The XML modification completely changes the format of the XML file regarding white spaces, since it re-exports the entire DOM.- The detection of the correct files happens by checking whether the URI fits the format <something>/plugion.xml and <something>/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF. This happens by String equals() methods, I have not found a nicer solution for this, but it still seems awkward.- The icon for the editor entry is still hardcoded (I have not found a way to extract the icon from the data available at runtime).",3,4916,2015/10/21 14:10,2015/10/22 8:17,18,MERGED,4,347,4,8,3,1

It's the branch that always points to the latest release. The Git master branch does not have this semantic.Also my guess is that in most cases, when users want to convert their repository to Gitflow, it would make more sense to turn the existing master into develop (e.g. the EGit repository).",4,5398,2015/8/28 21:44,2015/9/9 22:53,289,MERGED,10,386,3,6,6,0

Shall I do this change, or you do it?-code formatting: I don't really remember how, but years ago we ended up with our own way of formatting the code.

But you are right that it could be nice for the single process case.  We could look into an enhancement to show the exited process node even after GDB dies. I suggest we do that separately.  Note that the exit code is still visible in the title of the console in that case (as long as the process exited on its own).  > * I like this additional way to restart the terminated process from > the same session :-)Me too :)  But of course, that can only work if GDB is kept alive. > * Using the setting to ""Automatically debug forked process"" and > getting a small program which sequentially creates child forked > processes, don't preserve the exit code for all children but one. > This may be related to the collision of re-used group ids.Thanks for doing that test.

2376,"Patch Set 3:Let me explain the reset functionality. Before 4.4. if you applied a theme and afterwards another theme all stuff that was not overriden in the new theme remained styled as in the first theme. That was annoying and therefore we had this ""Restart"" warning in the Preference dialog (which you implemented).In 4.4. we introduced the ""reset to default"" functionality. If you switch from theme A to B, everything would be set to ""default"" and afterwards everything would be styled accordingly to B. This allows new themes to control everything without side effects from older themes. Please note that we still have a few bugs in the reset stuff, e.g., Form controls do not all support the reset functionality.So in your case, if I switch from one theme to ""Something else"" all styling must be resetted to the default, e.g., preferences, colors, etc. As you are now argue this reset requirement away for the OS settings in this review, we also tried to argue that away for the preferences but this was strongly requested by the JDT team.",3,6922,2015/4/17 10:16,2015/4/17 10:16,0,MERGED,14,218,3,13,10,1

2434,"Patch Set 1:(5 comments)Looks great.  A couple of minor improvements suggested in-line.For caching, we have a couple of options.1- we use the generic IGDBHardwareAndOS2.getResourcesInformation() so we could add caching to that call, but just for ""cpus"".  I don't like that because it makes the code less generic, and it may happen that the output of ""-info-os cpus"" does change2- we put a cache in GDBHardwareAndOS_7_10.  This makes sense because it is that service that knows if the data it uses can change.  Personally, I'd use a global array of ICoreInfo[] that gets filled once and then re-used. Don't forget to override flushCache() to also clear that cache (this is for a user operation where we just want to clear everything)",1,7025,2015/4/8 16:42,2015/4/9 10:49,18,MERGED,3,236,3,8,3,1

I uploaded a small example at http://www.mathematik.uni-marburg.de/~strueber/henshin_container_example.pngIn the meta-model underlying this example, ""club"" and ""player"" are EOpposite containment/container references. Consequently, both rules in this example have the same effect, which includes the removing and adding of the Player at a different place in the containment hierarchy (potentially a different model instance). However, B does not indicate this effect in the graphical syntax, which makes it difficult for the developer to understand the meaning of this rule.In a small example, the maintainability drawback might not be too drastic. But imagine that the meta-model might be complex and, worse, evolving over time.

So it is definitely not clear for me who is responsible for disposing created CCI's and how the new CCI instances created *for CPD only* are connected to the already existing buttons on the main toolbar.

2844,"Patch Set 1:Now that we have event aspects, the whole ITmfEventField interface is redundant. All queries for event information can go through aspects now. Look at BtfEventType#generateContent.

Those just cram the event information into the ITmfEventField format, and they don't even have to anymore.That aside, we won't realistically get rid of ITmfEventField any time soon. But I really think this is something we should strive to.I'm also a bit skeptical about the usefulness of typing manually field paths with slashes. How would the user know which fields actually exist? Is it useful to someone other than those who wrote the parser? A big advantage of aspects is discoverability, it can tell the user which information exists for an event.

2932,"Patch Set 13:Comments for patch set 10 are mostly resolved.The synchronization is done. Cool!Since the menu action toggles the filters, and we've already synchronized the content provider, we should really just invoke the same code when toggling the content provider. This would fix Case 3 and give a good user experience.Some other issues I found during testing:- The selection gets lost when switching Projects Presentation. This is bad UI behavior and switching Top Level elements also preserves the selection.- The menu items swap:	- first time the new menu item is second	- exit and restart: the new menu item is at the top	You need to specify the order/position relative to the existing item (Top Level Elements) - afaik this is possible- Empty folders get the + (or >) sign, but clicking does nothing. Switching back to flat presentation fixes the problem. Looks like an issue with #hasChildren()",13,7883,2014/12/12 10:11,2015/1/15 15:59,821,MERGED,12,1499,3,4,17,0

2977,"Patch Set 8:> I'm not sure why you're moving the information about disabled actionSets from the actionSets into the page hidden.  It is not moving but adding the persistence layer.> Is it just the regular mechanism is disconnected? I didn't get it, sorry.> For any given window, the perspective worked with the ActionSetManager to turn on or off actionSets (it seems to do it via the IContextService). It doesn't matter what the defaults were when the perspective was created, only that the perspective remember what actionSets are active at the moment.This is still true, but ActionSetManager (and also no one else) never persisted the ""disabled"" action sets as user choice. So you could request to show/hide them (depending on the application needs), but once user decides to get rid of some action set, this decision must ""override"" application choice. The best example is the debug action sett with the global debug buttons. In the old implementation you could try to ""hide"" them - but on next restart they will come back again, or, even worse, as soon as you hit a breakpoint - and this mean they will be back in a minute. See the nice comment about it in the LaunchView (written *before* the big e4 changes), line 1442:			// When the launch view becomes visible, turn on the			// debug action set. Note that the workbench will handle the			// case where the user really doesn't want the action set			// enabled - showActionSet(String) will do nothing for an			// action set that's been manually disabled.",8,7937,2014/12/21 15:32,2015/1/7 12:52,405,MERGED,3,66,4,7,14,1

3349,"Patch Set 1:Hi Neal,you messed things up a bit.1. On updating a patch you need to amend you changes so they have the same change id and we can see it in Gerrit in a clean timeline. You have created a new patch, which is not that good.2. You created a new example, which is also good. :) But I asked for tests. We have several JUnit test cases in the org.eclipse.nebula.widgets.nattable.core.test project. Adding the test cases will help us to verify that everything is working as expected and if anybody changes code later, it still works.3. I can see the whitespace issues in the Gerrit web view. Just open your changes there and you will see them marked red.I haven't pushed the modified code as I'm waiting for your modifications. :) And Gerrit will nofify you when I've done it.Greez,DirkP.S.

And the tab remains empty until I switch e.g. from a Class to a Property, probably because they have different contents in their appearance tab)Steps:- Create a Class diagram with classes and properties- Select the diagram and go to the General tab- Select a Class and go to the Appearance tab- Switch back to the diagram: the General tab is empty- Switch back to the class: the Appearance tab is empty- Select a Property: the Appearance tab is now populated- Select the Class: the Appearance tab is now populated- Select the Diagram: the General tab is still empty- Repeat from step 3 :)Performances are otherwise really good, when switching between similar elements.

3730,"Patch Set 3: (50 inline comments)Nice progress!  It is really starting to look right.1- Launching a debug session first, and then opening the OSResources view gives an NPE in the view2- Selecting the launch should allow the OSResources view to display things.  This will also allow to connect to a remote target without choosing a process to debug and still see the OSResources.  You probably need to modify GdbLaunch.getAdapter() to allow this.3- Say the view is displaying a resource type, it has the view menu showing. If I select the 'gdb' node in the debug view (or the launch node, or unselect everything), the view menu disappers. That is ok. However, when I select a valid node in the debug view, the menu does not appear again, until I press refresh.",3,9709,2012/5/5 8:54,2012/8/1 10:21,2113,MERGED,18,1785,2,5,9,0

3811,"Patch Set 13: Code-Review-1(1 comment)One more comment, then about the ""size"" discussion:- There are still some size() methods with no comments whatsoever.- I don't like size(), it's easy to confuse with Collections.size(). For public methods in specific objects, you could have getPacketSize(), getResponseSize() etc. IFixedSize is unnecessary.- Having some private methods where size() actually means something different (only first packet) is crazy design. You know today, but 2 months from now nobody will remember, and we'll have lots of fun debugging size problems. Specific methods names, like sizeOfFirstPacket() etc. would be safer.- If there is no interface, then the methods can be static (if the size is constant, of course). If it's static, it should be a public static final int, not a method. Methods should be only where the size can vary from one object to another.",13,9870,2014/4/18 18:11,2014/4/22 23:09,100,MERGED,44,2874,2,4,21,1

3992,"Patch Set 2:(16 comments)Thanks for the valuable feedback!Regarding the distinction of C++11 attributes and GCC attributes: I left the GCC attributes as is and added the attribute specifiers for representing C++11 attributes. The distinction can be seen for example in the NodeWriter. If an I(CPP)ASTAttribute is encountered in a IASTAttributeOwner it is expected to be a GCC attribute. If an ICPPASTAttributeSpecifier is encountered there, it is expected to be a C++11 attribute. The previous implementation of attributes is a bit limiting regarding the capabilities required by C++11 attributes (scope and multiple attributes in one specifier).I also thought about a solution which introduces an attribute specifier for GCC attributes, but that would break the current API. It's related to the problem mentioned in my comment (Line 23) in ICPPASTAttributeSpecifier.",2,10251,2014/1/30 8:46,2014/2/26 12:06,651,MERGED,39,1681,3,6,10,0

If this is OK i can do it. Otherwise i do not see how this can be solved. Thanks for the review :),1,10320,2014/1/13 13:15,2014/1/20 22:46,177,MERGED,11,656,2,3,8,0

4084,Patch Set 15: Code-Review+1A good starting point for symlink tests regarding checkout. +1 from me.An idea for more tests: All the tests here work mainly with two different states. What's in the current commit and what's in the commit I want to checkout. During checkout there are two more states which could differ from these two states. The index and the working tree. So we need (maybe in subsequent changes) tests where the working tree is dirty (differs from index) and where we have staged but uncommitted changes.,15,10435,2013/12/3 9:25,2014/2/10 22:29,1669,MERGED,2,264,4,5,20,0

4348,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1(15 comments)Hi XavierVery nice addition! Our user will want that.Beside the inline commends I have two requests below. Please let me know what you think about it.Currently, there is no means to trigger the export command handler. I would suggest to add this to the TmfEventsTable Pop-up menu.Here how you could call the command handler in the method createPopupMenu() of the TmfEventsTable programmatically:final IAction exportToTextAction = new Action(""ExportToText"") {            @Override            public void run() {                IWorkbenchPage activePage = PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getActiveWorkbenchWindow().getActivePage();                IHandlerService handlerService = (IHandlerService) activePage.getActiveEditor().getSite().getService(IHandlerService.class);handlerService.executeCommand(""org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.exportToText"", null);            }        };tablePopupMenu.add(exportToTextAction);-------I also would like to ask you to change the format of the text file to match the columns in the table and instead of a hard-coded order of columns (which are actually the default TMF table columns). This you can achieve using methods extractFieldItems() of TmfEventsTable and getColumns() of the TmfVirtualTable instance which is a member of TmfEventsTable. You will need some public methods to access these information and pass a reference to the TmfEventsTable instance as command parameter.",1,10972,2013/10/28 9:09,2013/10/28 9:09,0,MERGED,7,322,2,3,5,0

4613,"Patch Set 6:I don't really like this idea of blocking on the opening of a trace. Would there be a way to avoid it?For example, first call this new getTrace(), if the trace is opened, then you can use it, otherwise, the caller may decide to trigger the opening of the trace with the helper. But then you just let that proceed by itself, and if need be, use a signal handler to get notified when the trace is opened.",6,11339,2013/8/15 20:29,2013/8/15 20:30,0,MERGED,2,70,3,6,10,1
4614,"Patch Set 6:Just to add to the mix, I'm considering working on an approach where state systems are built in-band with the trace (trace calls buildStateSystem(), construction starts. trace calls dispose(), construction stops if applicable, files and closed and cleaned up if needed). a.k.a do away with the HistoryBuilder abomination entirely.We're having a bug right now with traces with 0 events: one part of the system is still waiting for the signal to start, and another part is trying to close it. Pain and tears ensue. Moving to the in-band approach would undoubtedly be the correct way to fix this.(those is-the-statesystem-started-yet? latches make me cringe ;) )However, this is a very big undertaking. It might be worth focusing on the future instead, where the ""analysis"" is the owner of the state system. Where it would control and know when construction is started and when it's done. We could learn from history, and do it right this time.",6,11339,2013/8/15 20:29,2013/8/15 20:30,0,MERGED,2,70,3,6,10,1

Nothing wrong with that, but we will have to update them when we do the EMF edit part.  Finally I'm having a few observations/questions on the model:    For the Approval and Requirements, I think the model is generic enough, although I never worked with requirements in Gerrit and I'm not sure how they work really.    I think the model is overly complex now with ReviewItemSets, ReviewItems and File items.  Do we really need the ReviewItem element anymore?  To me the information it holds pretty much relates to the ReviewItemSet (i.e. Gerrit PatchSet) anyways, so why keep it?    I saw that you introduced a Change element as a Review superclass.  What is the rationale behind this?  Can't all the info be in a single Review EClass?  Insn't Change a little bit too Gerrit-specific?  Also, I noticed that review now has Change parents and childrens elements.  I suppose this is to take care of the Depends and Needs Changes in Gerrit to see dependencies accross reviews.  Am I right in this?    The TaskReference is gone from the Review, but is still in the ReviewGroup.  I am a little confused by this.  I thought that the REview itself was a Mylyn task, so now where is the link?  Also, why do we still have a taskReference at the Review Group level?  I don't think we need it.    The location right now is restricted to line ranges i.e. textual input.  This will eventually have to change if we want to support Model Reviews, where the ""location"" is not a line range.  This is okay for now but to keep in mind longer term.    ",3,11869,2013/4/10 23:53,2013/4/11 0:26,0,MERGED,88,10187,3,11,4,1

5333,"Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this(4 inline comments)This looks like a good start! I added a few comments inline. Did you consider using a GradientToolTip instead of the listener in PatchSetSection? I would prefer to reuse the logic that's already in the tooltip class and potentially provide a hover with additional information. For the decorations it could be better to use a decorator similar to how R4E implements these: http://git.eclipse.org/c/r4e/org.eclipse.mylyn.reviews.r4e.git/tree/org.eclipse.mylyn.reviews.r4e.ui/src/org/eclipse/mylyn/reviews/r4e/ui/internal/navigator/ReviewNavigatorDecorator.java?id=90a91c4524a85a9ee8dbbf965b1e8f667b9ebbf2In terms of the icons, it would be nice to use the same icons that EGit or R4E uses for consistency. They also have more contrast to make them more visible. You can see them in the EGit commit viewer.Please note that Miles is currently working on a larger refactoring which will affects the same area of code and moves the label provider into the framework: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/8732/.

6331,"Patch Set 1: Verified; Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completedYour statement ""This means the exact plugin must bepresent in the current Eclipse installation to fulfill the dependency"" only is not true if you use p2 (Eclipse installer) for installing Features. p2 will resolve and install required plug-ins if they are defined in Require-Bundle and if packages of these plug-ins are are defined in Import-Package. It tried both. Your observation might be true for distribution-installed plug-ins. Nevertheless, I'm OK with the change. The move to Import-Package will allow for looser coupling between plug-ins.Here is an interesting blog about this topic:http://www.vogella.com/blog/2009/03/27/required-bundle-import-package/",1,12521,2012/7/30 20:30,2012/7/30 20:30,0,MERGED,4,28,2,2,2,0

6455,Patch Set 5:Mainly cleaned up the test case and increased the performance of this test. The test contained a lot of sleeps to avoid racily clean index entries. The number of sleeps have been reduced and the test runs faster.I am more confident about this fix because I see that native git also goes the same direction to update the working tree first and the update the index (see http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/jgit-dev/msg01730.html).One leftover is still not completely clear. Are there situations where we have to rollback modified working tree files in case while updating the working tree or the index we run into exceptions (e.g. can't update a locked working tree file),5,12585,2012/7/10 10:35,2012/7/11 21:44,35,MERGED,3,251,1,2,8,0

6508,"Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisI like the idea to cleanup certain timestamps during checkout, but we can't do this so blindly. It's wrong to always update the index entry with the timestamp of the associated work-tree file. Sometimes we keep index entries although we know that the filesystem has already been modified. Simply copying the filesystem timestamp would be wrong. Think about this: git init touch f.txt        // lastmodified(f.txt) = m git add f.txt      // timestamp(indexEntry(f.txt)) = m git commit -m initial git checkout -b side touch g.txt git add g.txt git commit -m modified1 sleep 2            // to avoid smudged entries echo x > f.txt     // lastmodified(f.txt) = m + 1 git checkout masterIn the last checkout we want to keep the index entry for f.txt with the timestamp of 'm' although we know that thefilesystem has already 'm + 1'Another issue is that this may be quite expensive (not sure about it). Imagine you have the linux kernel repo with 38000 files. You switch from branch master to develop. Since you have not touched the files we want to keep all 38000 files. And youre change forces us to ask the filesystem 38000 times for a timestamp. Without your change we can completely ignore the filesystem and the index for all those files where the HEAD version and the BRANCH version are equal (BRANCH version is the active version on the branch you want to checkout). I love this feature of git to be able to switch branches without having to check the dirtyness of the index and the working tree for 99% of the files.But: maybe you could check for smudged entries and update only them. If for smudged entries (timestamp=0) the filesystem content is the same as the index content then we could use copy over the filesystem lastmodified date and unsmudge the entry.",3,12614,2012/6/4 11:18,2012/6/4 11:18,0,MERGED,1,18,3,8,6,0
6509,"Patch Set 3:thanks for the review. i'm clearly no expert in this area (not yet ;)), and i knew this approach is (probably) not perfect. if you have ideas on how to do better, please feel free to instruct me (instruct me like a 4 year old, pls ;)) or even take over the change.i can only say about the performance: we have a repo with ~33000 files, and this was the reason i tried to improve the situation: re-indexing took ~5-10 minutes (!), and with this change is down to a few seconds, which is way better. AFAICT, the reading of the filestamp is rather unexpensive (at least compared to not reading it, and re-hashing file contents all the time ;)).if the keep() method is the wrong place, or if more care needs to be taken when to call it with zero (old behaviour) or the current file's timestamp (new behaviour) - i can't tell, but you may tell me, and i'll do my best :)currently i just can say that all unit tests go ok, and that i'm quite satisfied with how /fast/ this makes working with JGit/EGit; it really is approximately 50 times faster in most situations, and i had to wait _a lot_ before.",3,12614,2012/6/4 11:18,2012/6/4 11:18,0,MERGED,1,18,3,8,6,0

6671,"Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completedIt looks good to me so far, but I'll checkout and verify later.If I wanted to be picky I would say that you could reduce the number of classes as I don't think you need both a Compression stream interface and abstract class.  In fact because gzip and deflate are only different in the compressor and content type that are passed in, I probably would have gone with just a compressable stream class and passed those things into the constructor.    I would also drop the enum for compression type, as that is not compatible with polymorphism anyway. Just use the string mime type instead.I'll review again later this weekend and verify operation.",1,12723,2012/3/30 9:02,2012/3/30 9:02,0,MERGED,21,2013,1,4,1,0

6688,Patch Set 1:The behavior of equality here matches the behavior of equality for C Git. Subsection names are case sensitive. Section names and variable names are case insensitive in the US-ASCII character set.This is OK because section names and variable names are limited to a subset of US-ASCII. Subsection names are case sensitive because they could contain localized characters in e.g. branch names and C Git didn't want to mess with that. :-),1,12729,2012/3/27 15:49,2012/3/27 18:23,2,MERGED,3,204,3,8,1,0

6734,"Patch Set 6:In reply to Christians remarks:I can see the point with respect to the Refs that are not otherwise referenced (users may want to use them during a Rebase, for example). However, this whole thing started out by some colleague (and me) being irritated by exactly such References. You do a Rebase, it finishes, and suddenly you have that ORIG_HEAD thing popping into your face from the HistoryView. Instead of the nice linear history you wanted to achieve by the Rebase, you suddenly have something looking very much like two branches....I think that turning the toggle into some Always/Unreferenced/Never switch would confuse the poor user too much. They would have some branch on a commit and no white label, but once the branch moves to the next commit, the white label would magically appear?So perhaps the solution to this could be to make the Additional Refs visible by default and put a button close to the ""Show All Branches"" button so that users can more easily suppress the Refs? In other words, invert the flag to mean ""Suppress Additional Refs""?",6,12748,2012/2/7 8:08,2012/2/7 8:08,0,MERGED,7,118,2,3,8,1

6929,"Patch Set 3:Ok, here's Round 2.  I think I hit all of the style issues from before, and addressed the commonBase problem we discussed.  I did it in a slightly different way than your suggestion, but I think it makes a little bit more sense given how the data comes into the generator.  Let me know if you see any problems with it.The generator should now return all commits up to the specified depth, ignoring any that were part of commonBase.  But it will correctly start returning any commits below the boundary of a previous shallow checkout, and return all commits at the old boundary as UNINTERESTING so that the PackWriter can exclude the right things from the pack.  As far as I can tell, this is correct behavior in all cases.I couldn't do the SEEN thing like I was planning on doing, because uninteresting commits get the flag set on them as well (as part of markStart()), so sometimes it's already present on commits in our queue even though we haven't added all their parents yet.  I reworked the depth stuff a bit and added some comments, hopefully making it clear enough that the depth sorting accomplishes the same thing.I'm cautiously optimistic that this is getting pretty close.  Please let me know if there's anything else that needs to be done to get this thing completely out the door.",3,12948,2010/7/27 3:39,2010/8/25 20:09,712,MERGED,5,529,3,12,12,0

If they are all the same repository then there's no harm. If there are multiple repos then we might disable, or could show common names. For example, I might naively think I have to select all EGit projects to switch to another branch, or in the future, you might want to switch all EGit and JGit projects to the 0.11 branch. Although the branch would be different in each case they have the same name. The entry set could give branches in arbitrary order if I read this correctly. If so, can we sort?The comment in the single arg constrictor has ""default constructor"" which seems to be a cut and paste from the single arg version.

7263,"Patch Set 6: (5 inline comments)Regarding the latest performance improvements: that's really great and also votes for Patience diff as default diff.But one more general view on it here: Shawn last comment contained lines like:     testMyers 1280000 bytes took  21600751000 ns. N=2560000, D=4210, time/(N*D):2E0, time/(N*D^2):4.76E-4   testPatience 1280000 bytes took   3022629000 ns. N=2560000, D=793, time/(N*D):1.49E0, time/(N*D^2):1.88E-3This tells us that Patience diff can be even faster then Myers. But even more interesting to me is the value for D (the size of the found edit-script). PatienceDiff found an 5 times lesser edits than myers. I won't say that smaller edit-scripts (with probably huger regions) are better, but my big hope is that PatienceDiff brings ""better diffs"" regarding readability by humans. We should have tests with real-world content which proof that.

7549,Patch Set 14: (3 inline comments)Good and important work!You should change the commit message. It should describe the whole change. Comments meant for review should go into the gerrit comments. Otherwise it is difficult for a new reviewer to understand the whole change.I would find it useful to have the description of compatibility tests here (as in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=303925#c5).Do you plan to add core.excludesfile? Regarding that I would however suggest to do that in a subsequent commit.Please have a look at my inline comments.,14,13488,2010/6/28 18:05,2010/6/28 18:05,0,MERGED,21,1620,2,2,20,0
7550,"Patch Set 4:(Sorry for the triple commit) I've extended the test coverage as required.If the tests are failing, it is probably because they are unable to create a .git/info/exclude file.

The current patch should correctly delete any extra files/folders created for testing purposes.Please let me know if there is anything else I need to change :)",4,13488,2010/5/11 14:27,2010/5/13 20:45,54,MERGED,18,1310,1,2,20,0

8044,Patch Set 1:This seem to hurt LT proxy design. I'm not certain how to handle this change too. So lets discuss some ideas.I think it should be designed as:1. Create a new interface org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.IRemoteConnection2. Provides an implementation of IRemoteConnection for local connections (org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.LocalConnection)3. Your RDTConnection goes to package org.eclipse.linuxtools.internal.rdt.proxy. It should implement the IRemoteConnection interface too.4. The method RDTConnection#getConnectionsName goes to org.eclipse.linuxtools.internal.rdt.proxy.RDTProxyManager. Perhaps it should return a list of IRemoteConnection instead of the connections name. Notice that RDTProxyManager has already a getConnection(uri) method5. Finally create a method in org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.RemoteProxyManager to return either LocalConnection or RDTConnection based upon the URI and/or IProject.Notice that org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch has already two classes about remote connection: RemoteConnection and RemoteConnectionException. They doesn't fit in current LT proxy design but I am not sure how to deal with it... :(,1,14238,2015/10/20 18:20,2015/10/20 18:20,0,ABANDONED,12,292,3,4,3,1

8148,"Patch Set 1:This is a new Gerrit review presenting a variation of change 38587 that fixes the problem of every regeneration of the tests producing code in a new random order, which I discussed on the Papyrus-Dev mailing list. This is accomplished primarily by a verbatim translation of the QVTo transformation steps to Xtend language.  The overall design of the transformation pipeline is the same as before:  in particular, the UML models are the same.  It's just the language in which the transformations are specified that has been changed.Xtend exposes list values in UML models in their native EList terms, which affords stable and predictable ordering of transformation operations and, hence, test model structure and generated code.  It also provides for more concise, debuggable, searchable, and performant transformations with better Java integration.  On the subject of performance:  a comparison of the QVTo version against the equivalent Xtend version, averaged over 5 runs after a couple of warm-ups with the longest run discarded finds that the Xtend version runs more than twice as fast:  49.75 seconds as compared to 117.25 seconds.  This is including the M2T code-generation step that is the same Xtend in both cases and XMI identifier generation which is unique to the Xtend implementation of the UML transformations.  But, to me this is a bonus, not the important factor:  it's the tooling support and stability of the transformation that are most significant.A new UMLWriter workflow component is employed to assign predictable, stable XMI identifiers to elements of generated UML models to avoid unnecessary diffs in source control when re-generating.  (somewhat moot now that the models are no longer in git)This patch set also regenerates the test code from the Xtend version of the framework. I have git-ignored the generated UTP source models because they reference and depend on UML instance models of the GMFGens that are already git-ignored, so there's no point in having these in git.  Besides that they are now much larger because of the generated unique XMI IDs.I welcome any feed-back you may have on the question of whether we should adopt this Xtend-based transformation or continue with the QVTo implementation.  I do want to continue adding more synchronization test cases to complete the coverage of that new capability, so it would be nice to do that only in one or the other variant of the test framework.  ;-)",1,14589,2014/12/10 13:52,2015/4/14 21:13,3007,ABANDONED,524,186169,2,5,6,0

Eclipse provides an extension point for that to define context sensitive help which can be opened from a view, dialog, wizard etc. The context sensitive help opens the relevant chapters in the User Guide.

So, the merge to master must not include those changes, so best not to implement them on the branch in the first place.  The purpose of any useful branch is eventually to merge it to master, so the same rigor should be applied to every branch as would be applied to master.> About site.xml and xdoc :> they are used by the ""mvn site"" commandYes, but currently they are empty or at least they look like generated templates.> => it should ease the doc/site generation (ex javadoc)Are we proposing to start publishing Maven project sites to Eclipse.org?

Is there a wiki page referencing official collegiate decisions ? )Not that I know of.  There's just the pattern established when Tycho was first implemented in Papyrus and some discussions on the mailing list and conference calls that I remember (or perhaps misremember).

These POMs need to be better modularized, and not just because of the number of times I've had to manually merge them because they're a central locus of change!

8317,"Patch Set 10: Code-Review-1(12 comments)I'm generally ok with this change. High-level comments:  * The view descriptions are a specific item, distinct from the tooltips.  They are thrown away by the ViewRegistry, but shouldn't be.  This is a blocker, IMHO.  * I don't much like the category story, especially with how the ""general"" category is pulled out. But this is forced due to how our current model is built, where an MPartDescriptor's category is not the actual category id and the category is actually encoded as a tag (and hence not localizable?).  ViewRegistry should be fixed, but that doesn't have to be done as part of this work.  I'd at least like this category-finding code pulled out with a comment.  I wonder if we could use the MCategory for this purpose too.  * Change CapabilityFilter to know how to build an activity-style IIdentifier for model elements.

8325,"Patch Set 1:Hi J Langley,First, thanks for the contribution!   Your patch looks excellent.  I think we should easily be able to get this incorporated into ECF 3.9.1.A few very minor comments:1) For the ScpBrowseFileTransferFactory class:  Is there any need to have this class be in a new (and exported) package org.eclipse.ecf.provider.filetransfer.scp?  Unless you already know that this class is going to be accessed by some other bundle, I would prefer that it be placed in the existing internal package:  org.eclipse.ecf.internal.provider.scp.  That way, the scp provider code would all be exposed by internal-only packages...and this browse edition would be consistent with the retrieve and send classes (which are in the internal package now).2) If you move the ScpBrowseFileTransferFactory class into the internal package, it would make it unnecessary to export a new package in the manifest.mf.  For maintenance, it would be nice for us to continue to not export any non-internal packages.I can make the following changes if you wish...just wanted to include them in public review:3) The Bundle-Version in the manifest should be updated from 2.0.100.qualifier to 2.1.0.qualifier (minor revision because of new functionality).4) In org.eclipse.ecf.internal.provider.filetransfer.scp.ScpFileSystemBrowser there are a couple of commented lines:		// FIXME - This code is from ScpOutgoingFileTransfer, but it throws		// exceptions		// if (scpUtil != null) {		// scpUtil.sendZeroToStream(outputStream);		// scpUtil.checkAck(inputStream);		// }Probably best just to remove these lines...unless they are needed for the browse.But overall things look great.  I will fix 3 and 4 prior to commit if you prefer.  If you could address 1/2...or just let me know that there is a good reason for creating/exporting a new package for this class...then I will approve, get things published, submitted and built/tested via the ECF builder for deployment.

However, the current RMF target platform includes version 4.8.2 (which is part of the Eclipse JDT v.3.7.2). Plese note: Our current build is still based on eclipse 3.7 (indigo). Nevertheless, the orbit update site includes junit 4.10, which could be used as well.@ Fran├ºois: Do you use the RMF indigo target development definition?(2) Our plan is to build RMF 0.9.0 on top of Kepler. The Kepler update site includes a newer version of JDT as well as a newer version of Junit.(3) I guess, that the JUnitBenchmark library is not part of the Eclipse Orbit Project.

8387,"Patch Set 1: Verified+1I took a quick look at it. Wim, no my extension point can not be used like this, as he adds a tab the the overall edtitor, while the vertical extention point adds it to the single elements in the tree.(+) I think it is very interesting, and provides means to solve a few problems. I also like the possiblity to have a list instead of the tree.(-)It breaks with the consistent Eclipse usage one is used to. That is, e.g. the feature to mark duplicate ids should be embedded more Eclipse style s.t. it integrates into the problems view etc. I like the feature to jump to the entries in the tree and the source, again, this should be solved the eclipse way. Repair and Mark should be applicable to the tree.The argument requirement org.eclipse.e4.tools.modeleditor.utilitytab.enabled is a no go.I like the patch, I don't like that it breaks with the way one is used to use Eclipse and I think the functionality embedded should be integrated in other ways. I like the idea of a table based editor in addition to the tree based editor but all concepts presented should apply for either way of editing it.Thanks Steven!!",1,15214,2014/4/1 20:34,2014/4/1 20:37,0,ABANDONED,11,967,4,5,3,0

8436,"Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1Would it be possible to split this in smaller patches? Smaller patches means it's easier to review, easier to bisect, revert if needed, etc., but more importantly, it really shows the logical progression and tells the reviewers where they should be looking at first.I think this could be easily split in:* Add the ""xychart"" package and the base TmfXYChartViewer, as well as the dependencies in the manifest* Add the TmfBarChartViewer and its related classes (they could go in a xychart.barchart package, but it doesn't really matter.)* Add the tracing.examples plugin, with its settings (but no contents)* Add the NewHistogramView(I myself still have many huge patches I will try to break down in the next couple days, like the null-annotations one.)I like the notion of an ""examples"" plugin, it's very useful for prototyping, but can serve as kind of staging for ""real"" views.

But getFile would return the resource behind the ""pom.xml"" in the ""foo"" project, because the path argument of getFile is a workspace-path!Later, bad things would happen because exists actually returns true for the above resource, but it would be the wrong one. Ugh.Another idea would be this: If getFileForLocation returns null, use getFile(new Path(""._egit_internal_project_for_synchronization"").append(childLocation)).

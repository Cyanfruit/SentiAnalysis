What do you think ?1. tpstatus label is obscured; not clearly visible. Maybe better if we add a background below this label, or something to make it visible clearly ?2. It should be possible to close the dialog when user clicks somewhere else. Currently, only way to close the dialog is to hit again on the toolbar button.3. I think we should limit the dimensions of table user can create with this new toolbar button just like we do in desktop, because if we don't it would stick to the mouse movements and user will have a hard time to find an empty space to close the dialog button. This is pretty annoying from user POV, I think.4. I noticed that the state of this new toolbar button doesn't get reset whenever user manages to close the dialog. So for eg: if user closed the dialog with table dimensions 12 x 12 selected, the next time he opens it, it would still be at 12 x 12. The state should be reset everytime dialog is closed.5. Currently, user has to move his mouse slowly to select desired dimensions. If he moves the mouse little faster, the dialog doesn't notice that.6. You have limited the width of dialog unlike its height. I think you intend to limit the number of columns user can choose here (?), _but_ if user moves his mouse back and forth near the right edge, more number of columns gets added to the same width increasing the number of cells per row - density - which makes the grid a mess. Can we somehow avoid that ?

I tried that. And can give it another try. But it would require a much bigger change, obviously. The main problem is that wingdi.h is actually included from other windows headers too. So we can't fully control when it's included. But can give it another shot and narrow it down further. In fact, I spent hours trying to find what file includes the conflicting values to create this patch. > The current fix allows workdir/CustomTarget/officecfg/registry/officecfg/Office/Common.hxx > to be included, but if a source file happens to first include that > officecfg/Office/Common.hxx, then include wingdi.h, and later wants > to acutally use the struct RGB from Common.hxx, it still runs into > a problem.Well, that would be be a problem _only_ if wingdi.h was already included _before_ Office/Common.h, and in that case the build would fail because the macro would conflict with the declaration of RGB (my patch avoids this situation).However, if wingdi.h was _not_ included at the point of #undef RGB, then nothing bad would happen if it is included afterwards. Unless I missed something, I don't see how there would still be a problem, as wingdi.h will define RGB without issue.I should add that I hated this particular line of my patch.

The timing of this instigates doubt that one of the reasons is to level down the Win32 and Win64 versions to the same feature set.As to ""could be rewritten from scratch"", yes, it could; the absence of activity on bugs 56903 56905 and 57322 suggests that we don't have the volunteer manpower to do that.

It was MY example doc (albeit vml) that actually was numbered in the reverse order and so wouldn't have worked on the old logic. And your test document loaded/looked fine.  So in my mind I'm combining all that plus some things I saw (can't remember all where) about mso-layout-flow-alt indicating a reverse sequence - where the highest number starts the chain instead of ends the chain, but although this alt-flow is put in the grabbag, it is never used.  In the end the lack of reverse chaining is still a (potentially) missing feature, not a regression.",6,12582,2015/6/30 9:55,2015/7/1 12:19,26,MERGED,6,159,4,8,6,negative

4260,"Patch Set 2:First, thanks for working on this.I am sorry, I could not test the patch easily because I do not longer work on LO and do not have the build environment at hands. So, I just react to the comments.If this patch causes that Draw behaves different way when pasting from Writer and Draw then it is even less intuitive that the previous behavior and I suggest to revert it.IMHO, it should not matter where you paste from. Also all LO appications should handle the pasting the same way.When I think about it, the confusion might be in the definition of selected object. If you select part of text in Writer and paste something, the selected text is overwritten, so writer behaves the same way as Draw.The problem is that in Writer, if no test is selected, the cursor is somewhere between two characters and pasted text is added. No text is selected most of the time when you write a text. You need to do explict action (select the text) to overwrite it.In draw, the last added or edited object is always selected, so most of the time some object is selected. This causes that the last object is overwritten when pasting. You need to do explicit action (deselect the object) to avoid overwriting.To be honest I am not sure how to solve this.PS: I am sorry if I added the comment a wrong way. I am not familiar with the current Gerrint interface. I did not find any way how to replay any existing comment.",2,18336,2013/9/7 12:00,2014/5/15 21:39,6009,MERGED,1,8,3,6,2,negative

I was a bit upset that the headless patch was merged even though the ESC asked the author not to merge it in its current form. The opengl situation on our Android port is a bit unclear. On one hand, we disable opengl in configure, OTOH it seems we build most of the opengl code in vcl. My commit just restored that status quo, fixing the build. I also verified that the build result actually works. :-)Given that at the end Android uses cairo to render the tiles, the opengl code is not useful on Android. However, probably it's a good idea to not work on removing it from the Android binary till it's not clear if those opengl #ifdefs will go away or not in the long run.

12385,Patch Set 1:(1 comment)So this is going to be an ugly one.We are now hitting a limitation of the current test framework. Currently all our tests don't have access to the UI configuration as it breaks the tests. Now I don't remember why I went the way of pointing the ui path to the user profile but it still seems to be necessary. Back when I wrote that code there were however no UI files so it was still so that the whole UI should have worked. Now with the UI files this is no longer true and pointing the UI config path to a place that does not the UI files causes an exception and later a crash.I will need some time to get back into the details of the configuration management during the tests.,1,25668,2016/3/21 14:48,2016/3/21 14:48,0,ABANDONED,3,60,3,7,2,negative

In the lpsolve fix, it is not a good idea to redirect all   error messages to /dev/null. It would hide real build   errors as well.      Instead, it would be better to fix the lpsolve code   to do not produce warnigns at all.3. The concat-deps.c is strange as well. It is a similar   problem like in dmake.      IMHO, we need to return an error if it does not write   the whole item => you need to modify the function   print_fullpaths to return integer instead of void.

13762,"Patch Set 2:the difference between build.pl and tail_build implementations of module.all is that with build.pl all dependent modules are built completely while for tail_build only the target module is built completely, and from the others only the directly needed targets are build, so adding dependencies to solenv/gbuild/Module.mk doesn't help.but i still don't like the patch :)just look at how many places load a ""fps_office"" resource...i think there are some more options:1. move the failing tests to subsequentcheck, that would be much simpler2. go though all resource loading calls and add explicit resource dependencies to each Library_foo.mk that contains a call.   i guess these are loaded via ResMgr::CreateResMgr or possibly via ResMgr::SearchCreateResMgr as well; 94 calls3. put in some hack to be used only by unit tests that loads all resources from a different path, and add to each test some rule that copies all needed resources to a test specific directoryhmm i don't like 3. much either...",2,27993,2012/8/9 9:43,2012/8/12 23:51,86,ABANDONED,22,99,3,10,2,negative

13764,"Patch Set 1: Do not submitso certainly manual dependencies on resource files are a PITA, but...you are assuming that for every resource target there is a library with the same name; this is not actually the case;for example see extensions/AllLangResTarget_upd.mk.furthermore i don't actually know whether even if there _were_ a library for every resource target, this approach would work, because i don't know how these resource files are loaded: are they always loaded from exactly one library, or can it happen that there are 2 libraries that load the same resource file?i'm afraid this would need a more holistic cleanup to ensure a sane relationship between resource files and libraries first.",1,27993,2012/8/9 9:43,2012/8/9 17:11,7,ABANDONED,22,99,3,3,2,negative

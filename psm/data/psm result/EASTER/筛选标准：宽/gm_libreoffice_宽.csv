Calling any document content related functions for > the unallocated column clearly must not happen.Hi EikeThanks a lot for the review. Just to clarify regarding the nCol != -1 check, we need to let methods like Reset(), SetPatternArea(), ApplyStyleArea() to be called for the aNextColAttrArray but *without* changing any document content. An alternative to nCol != -1 checks is that we can have a default parameter or data member called bUnallocated with default value = false for all such methods and use that instead of (nCol != -1) when calling from aNextColAttrArray. Would that be better at least in terms of readability of the code ?In the meantime I will fix the other issues as per your comments.

Now columns with custom width (0,85┬┤┬┤,  0,95┬┤┬┤)) are very close to Default Column Width (0,89┬┤┬┤).It means that there is no space for errors.

It does not affect how other code handles it. Of course if we get a lot of SEH excepions from outside of our control that are currently caught in one of the catch all handlers we are going to crash a lot.EHs has basically two effects on the code. catch(...) will not catch SEH exceptions and there is no stack nwinding and destructor calls going to be for SEH exceptions.I think both are fine in our code. The case that some external part is handling SEH with EHa should not concern us as if we get a SEH from that cod ewe will just crash and if that code handles it we are not going to see it anyway.,2,4026,2016/6/20 7:02,2016/6/20 13:55,6,MERGED,9,70,5,9,2,0

621,Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1(1 comment)This commit needs to be split into at least 2 if not more patches.This mixes so many things (even if they are all related to validation). E.g. I'm unhappy with the DOCX part in the chart test unless someone is going to maintain them. I'm happy to maintain the calc parts and as far as I know I'm the only one really caring about the chart tests.At least all the non binary validation changes in the chart code need to go into an independent patch that can be discussed independently. With the current chart change this -1 should be seen as meaning a -2 with the chance to remove the -1 by splitting the unrelated parts into an own commit.For the calc part it is surely not the best idea to add uncommented code when are actually discouraging that. Hide it behind a ifdef or something like that to make it clearer that it is actually useful and should not be removed directly.,5,4211,2016/6/3 14:39,2016/6/10 15:33,168,MERGED,11,156,4,5,7,1

762,"Patch Set 2:Hi Faruk,Thanks for working on this, it looks awesome, except I have few comments that I think should be taken care of before we merge this. What do you think ?1. tpstatus label is obscured; not clearly visible. Maybe better if we add a background below this label, or something to make it visible clearly ?2. It should be possible to close the dialog when user clicks somewhere else. Currently, only way to close the dialog is to hit again on the toolbar button.3. I think we should limit the dimensions of table user can create with this new toolbar button just like we do in desktop, because if we don't it would stick to the mouse movements and user will have a hard time to find an empty space to close the dialog button. This is pretty annoying from user POV, I think.4. I noticed that the state of this new toolbar button doesn't get reset whenever user manages to close the dialog. So for eg: if user closed the dialog with table dimensions 12 x 12 selected, the next time he opens it, it would still be at 12 x 12. The state should be reset everytime dialog is closed.5. Currently, user has to move his mouse slowly to select desired dimensions. If he moves the mouse little faster, the dialog doesn't notice that.6. You have limited the width of dialog unlike its height. I think you intend to limit the number of columns user can choose here (?), _but_ if user moves his mouse back and forth near the right edge, more number of columns gets added to the same width increasing the number of cells per row - density - which makes the grid a mess. Can we somehow avoid that ? Also as pointed out in (3) limiting number of rows makes sense here.Besides these, I found a missing '+' (see inline comments which makes me suspect this is not the version you have in your local box since this version doesn't work out of the box unless someone changes code himself - is it ?)",2,5101,2016/5/1 12:07,2016/5/1 12:21,0,MERGED,3,99,2,5,3,1

These 3 functions don't have an _xlfn prefix in OOXML as they don't exist there. I haven't fully checked yet if all entries in formulabase.cxx and xlformula.cxx are correct here.-My main efforts so far have been to get the functions working as they should (and changing constraints where MS Excel preaches them but does _not_ apply them).I want to change one last constraint (the time(X)-interval needs to be constant, but in case of dates an interval of months (28 to 31 days) is accepted by Excel. I have to find out how much deviation is accepted by Excel and how to incorporate this in the code, with interpolation in forecasts etc..Then I want to do a lot of numerical comparisons between Calc and Excel - where possible.Then I need to make a unit test; simple no-difference check with Excel is not possible as it is a forecast and the result depends on the exact method and sometimes random numbers.Then I want to go through the code again with a toothbrush.Then I want to prepare help-text (for someone else to put into the repository).And then my draft could become a real submission.We'll be in 2016 be then, it's a huge job - for me, at least ;)",6,7278,2015/11/20 7:47,2015/12/21 18:30,754,MERGED,14,1804,3,10,16,0

1368,Patch Set 4:Hmm. That will most likely hurt us later but well we can deal with it then.I had chats with Kohei and Eike and I think the solution that seems to be acceptable to all of us is to use a std::vector<ScColumn*> or std::vector<std::unique_ptr<ScColumn>> with the additional requirement that there are no nullptr entries.This provides us with some benefits compared to the version without the additional requirement and the version based on std::vector<ScColumn>. We don't need to check every entry while iterating through columns (just compare once against std::vector::size) and we don't need to worry that pointers to ScColumn instances become invalid when we insert or remove a column.

You need to update to a git checkout that ncludes the pushed patch already. One solution to avoid long recompile times is to have a separate push tree + charry-picking the commit from current master. Then only add the new commit to the push tree (which already contains the pushed commit) and push to gerrit for review.Gerrit complained that you tried to push a patch that has been merged already to gerrit review.

I tried that. And can give it another try. But it would require a much bigger change, obviously. The main problem is that wingdi.h is actually included from other windows headers too. So we can't fully control when it's included. But can give it another shot and narrow it down further. In fact, I spent hours trying to find what file includes the conflicting values to create this patch. > The current fix allows workdir/CustomTarget/officecfg/registry/officecfg/Office/Common.hxx > to be included, but if a source file happens to first include that > officecfg/Office/Common.hxx, then include wingdi.h, and later wants > to acutally use the struct RGB from Common.hxx, it still runs into > a problem.Well, that would be be a problem _only_ if wingdi.h was already included _before_ Office/Common.h, and in that case the build would fail because the macro would conflict with the declaration of RGB (my patch avoids this situation).However, if wingdi.h was _not_ included at the point of #undef RGB, then nothing bad would happen if it is included afterwards. Unless I missed something, I don't see how there would still be a problem, as wingdi.h will define RGB without issue.I should add that I hated this particular line of my patch. I share your view that it's best avoided altogether. But I couldn't find a better solution. Will try again though.",4,9501,2015/11/11 1:47,2015/11/12 10:55,33,MERGED,21,483,2,7,4,1

Ironically, I don't think they are important for Base itself, but more for the services that Base provides to other components: namely the capacity for Writer to do mail merges on Outlook, Outlook Express, Thunderbird and LDAP address books (on Windows 32 bit).Oh the other hand, I understand and see that this whole old precompiled binary mozilla thing is a monstrosity that cannot continue indefinitely, in addition of being against our FLOSS principles. The timing of this instigates doubt that one of the reasons is to level down the Win32 and Win64 versions to the same feature set.As to ""could be rewritten from scratch"", yes, it could; the absence of activity on bugs 56903 56905 and 57322 suggests that we don't have the volunteer manpower to do that.

Hor mirror does not change the text at all, vertical mirror uses a 180 deg rotation, *not* a true vert mirroring.This only does not come to more attention due to the fact that nearly all shapes are CustomShapes nowadays...Do not forget: mirror in X and Y equals a 180 deg rotation (can be seen/proved looking at the corrresponding homogen matrix)",4,9572,2015/11/22 6:04,2015/11/23 14:27,32,MERGED,3,41,3,5,5,1

When changing the state, the layout is invalidated and the the default logic of repaginating and page-layout does its thing on next idle timer event. So changing this behavior will affect others as well. While changing the position is not desirable, changing the cursor and losing selection is even more problematic--both of which I prevent in this patch. >  > On a separate issue, it might be better to have the entry labelled > 'Whitespace' and change the toggle behaviour, so when its > unchecked, it goes into hide whitespace mode.Interesting point.

About the insert point to decode URL.As you wrote, I think that the best way to convert is in PasswordDialog ctor.However, to reduce the influence I now was according to the method for the other formats(odf,etc...).For the other formats, probably insert points to decode URL are just before calling the UNO API, Document(MS)PasswordRequest(2).

Therefore, in the case of OOXML, I think that the insert point to decode URL is either within MediaDescriptor::requestAndVerifyDocPassword() in unotools or DocPasswordHelper::requestAndVerifyDocPassword() in comphelper.Because the latter point has a smaller effect, I will modify the patch.(I think in the comphelper, INetURLObject can not be used because of the module dependencies.

The tests I wrote were counting the number of times the timers trigger in a multi-timer scenario. What I had discovered is that there is a lack of consistency, which I have plans to fix/address.For example, when two timers have the same timeout and priority, one could get a very low trigger rate (or none at all). This is because the trigger logic always picks the one with highest priority that is next in line, and so can end up picking the same timer to trigger every time, starving the other(s).I have a patch to address this and also to fix make IdleTimer fire only when the process idles. >  > But I didn't read the unit test code too carefully - thanks so much > for re-basing the cleanups =) lets submit as/when CI builds it > cleanly if it can.The reason I had disabled the fail condition when the new tests were excluded is because the remaining code is useful in detecting timers that don't trigger during the watchdog timeout. That is, timers should eventually trigger, even if they don't trigger with any accuracy. So I was effectively disabling the accuracy test, but the timers should've triggered during the dozen seconds that the watchdog ways (which you've increased). The test not passing reliably was because of the strictness of the precision tests, not the fact that timers weren't triggering (which would be a real bug). The precision tests are only meaningful if they come with some delta, and I had used 10-20%, increasing it would mean more passing runs, but less useful precision tests. Let's keep them disabled for now.Thanks again for the reviews and helping with this. And please expect more patches on timers.",4,11076,2015/7/19 23:40,2015/9/1 16:56,1049,MERGED,6,174,3,5,7,0

Good to know. The reason I wrote this script is because I have another patch that improves pch generation (a rewrite of update_pch in python that updates every single pch in the codebase in a few seconds). It was obvious to me that to improve the pch generation to make builds faster I had to deal with the problem of conflicting headers (that are excluded from pch) and required headers (that will break the build if left out). This script solves the latter problem, so now what is included in pch headers is purely to accelerate builds, not to prevent the build from breaking.Will submit the update_pch script and updated pch files sometime soon, as time permits.",1,11103,2015/9/1 0:33,2015/9/1 0:33,0,MERGED,16,378,4,6,2,0

Also in ScFormulaCfg::ImplCommit() CONV_A1_XL_A1 is not handled.In sc/source/filter/oox/workbookhelper.cxx in WorkbookGlobals::initialize() has aCalcConfig.meStringRefAddressSyntax = getConvention(xDocProps); where getConvention() returns CONV_OOO if the generator was not Microsoft.

2709,"Patch Set 8: Code-Review-1The import part looks good, and functions very well.  Great job on doing your analysis and coming up with a very well thought-out solution.Now, the only remaining issue is the saving.  Right now, when you open a csv.gz file, edits it, and hits Ctrl-S, it saves it back to the file uncompressed, while the extension is intact.  This is not ideal.I can think of 2 ways to resolve this.  The first way is to support saving it back gz compressed, by somehow storing the information that this file has been uncompressed and using that information and trigger gz compression on saving.  In this scenario, you need to be careful not to compress on save when the user decides to save the file with a different name.  There would be other corner cases you'd have to handle when going this route. Personally I don't like this solution.The 2nd way is to load the file read only when the file is automatically uncompressed during file detection.  This way, when the user wants to edit it and re-save it, she won't be able to overwrite the original file.  I personally like this solution.Here is the gotcha, though.  Forcing a read-only load is as easy as setting the read only flag to true with the media descriptor, which will prompt you that the document has been opened read only, and to edit it, the user will need to click ""Edit document"" to create a new document instance.  When you do that, Calc will still load the compressed stream into the 2nd document instance, not the uncompressed version.  This needs to be addressed.I hope this will not be too much trouble to solve.  Good luck!",8,13520,2015/4/15 16:52,2015/4/20 15:06,118,MERGED,3,46,2,3,10,0

Could you make the change for that and update your patch?  I'd like to give that a spin.One very minor thing I would change is to switch from replaceFirst() to copy() to get a substring of the original URL in order to remove the .gz extension.  Using replaceFirst is fine, but I personally find using the copy() method more ""natural"" for that sort of use given that you already have the position of the "".gz"" string.  You can use nIdx as the ""length"" of the new substring when using copy().Thanks a lot!",8,13520,2015/4/15 16:52,2015/4/20 15:06,118,MERGED,3,46,2,3,10,0

2811,"Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1This patch still has issues.1) The new option shouldn't be added to the popup window since it's not an action but it's an attribute. The popup window is the wrong place to house this option.  It should go to the Field options dialog which can be reached from the layout dialog by double-clicking on the field name (which is kinda hidden, I know).  Once that dialog is open, you still need to click on the Options button to get to the actual dialog where you need to add this option.2) This should be a field (or dimension as it's called in the code) option. As such, it should be stored in ScDPSaveDimension as a new boolean member, not in ScDPSaveData, which should only store table-wide options.3) ODF export code should also reflect that, and store the new setting as a dimension attribute.  Right now you are saving it as a table attribute, which is wrong.  I didn't check your change in the import code, but I'd guess it has a similar issue.I did check Excel once again. Excel doesn't offer this as a table wide option. Only a field setting option.  What you saw is probably the print option where the user can choose to repeat field names when printing.

2820,"Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1The patch looks completely reasonable from the POV of the current state of the code. However, code archaeology suggests that merge commit 67d2af6fac2d9bad52a6b1f6e0cbd1229eb88a42 erroneously removed the call to ""ImplUpdate"" in MoveItem, since that line is present in BOTH parents of that merge. The ""if ( nNewPos < nPos )"" seems to be done for the sake of the ImplUpdate, to set the argument it will be called with. It looks reasonable, since the call is made with the default value of bDirect==false, then ImplUpdate updates *all* columns after its first argument (its argument inclusive). So it is essentially called with ::std::min(nPos, nNewPos).So it seems to me that we should rather fix the error in bd24a310be1459510b760b812838cb87923853c5 of using ""nPos"" instead of ""nNewPos"" in the second call of ::std::advance (the one before insert), but leave the ""if ( nNewPos < nPos )"" and reinsert the ""ImplUpdate(nPos, ...)"".Kendy, I know it is far away, but would you agree with my analysis of your merge commit?Julien, could you try out my suggestion above and test its effects, if the behaviour is good, the bug is still fixed, no other obvious bug is introduced, etc?

2832,"Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1The basic idea is a good one here. Clearly the ScHorizontalAttrIter is used in a ton of places across the code-base, particularly in filters, and making it ~instant for all the common big-data cases is very helpful.The basic approach looks good too - the nMinNextEnd looks sensible to detect large runs of identical formatting.What doesn't convince me that much is the initialization and management of the pPrevColEnd array. It looks like that is not initialized initially [sic] ;-) and then there is an assumption that:                if ( bRepeatedRow )                    nCol = pPrevColEnd[nCol];-but- (AFAICS) there is no guarentee that pPrevColEnd[nCol] is setup correctly - it rather depends on the value of nCol that was used last time - which (in turn) depends on the shape of the data.So - I would suggest adopting a different approach for generating and managing that - along with some nicer data structure for this case. IIWY I'd detect the case where there is a large run of identical styles - and in that case do more work to analyze them into a complete structure - that can be re-used for several subsequent rows; eg. if there are > 2x rows with the same thing - then allocate & fill that structure in (eg.).Is that do-able ? hopefully it'll make the code flow more pleasant too =)I'd also like to see a unit test created for the case that looks like it should fail in the above =) where we have constant patterns down a run - but a random layout of cell content.Thanks !",3,14212,2015/2/18 0:36,2015/2/18 0:36,0,MERGED,2,51,2,3,6,0

2913,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1Calling maItemList.erase(it) indeed invalidates it, we are not authorised to use it any more.However, assigning to it the return value of erase does not match my understanding of the code block that follows the for loop, that is issue a SAL_WARN if the button id to be deleted was not found. Now this SAL_WARN would incorrectly be triggered when the last button (the one that is last in maItemList) is successfully deleted.At first I thought about: * introducing a boolean flag ""found"" for this information,   which is a bit awkward, especially for an information that   is used only in debug mode:   bool found(false);   for(...)   {       if(...)       {           found=true;           ....       }   }   if(!found)       SAL_WARN(...) * taking more control of the looping than in a ""usual"" for loop pattern:   for (it = maItemList.begin(); ; ++it)   {       if (it == maItemList.end())       {           SAL_WARN( ""vcl.window"", ""ButtonDialog::RemoveButton(): ButtonId invalid"" );           break;       }       else if (it->mnId == nId)       {           ...       }   }but then I got the idea of just replacing the ""break"" by a ""return"" since this is the end of the function anyway.",1,14488,2015/2/4 20:58,2015/2/4 20:58,0,MERGED,1,2,3,9,3,1

It would probably be better to not have that search code also in jfw_findAndSelectJRE, but rather transport the information about how a JRE has been found from getAllJREInfos to jfw_findAndSelectJRE, so that the latter can pick the ""best"" based on that and not only on version numbers.(Also, the plugin architecture in jvmfwk is probably over-architectured, and I would like to get rid of it, not the least to drop all the #ifdef DISABLE_DYNLOADINGs, and to ease maintenance of that code.)",1,15251,2014/9/10 12:56,2014/9/11 8:26,19,MERGED,2,410,2,5,3,1
3077,"Patch Set 1:Thank you very much for your feedback and your hints!I have thought about how to best implement this and would appreciate your feedback on my ideas.The possibilities I am currently thinking about are as follows:1) Add two new functions (e.g. ""jfw_plugin_getJavaInfoFromJavaHome"", ""jfw_plugin_getJavaInfosFromPath"") to vendorplugin.hxx and sunjavaplugin.cxx to obtain information about Java installations referred to by JAVA_HOME and PATH environment variables (similar to jfw_plugin_getAllJavaInfos). The two functions use the functions in util.cxx to get the information.jfw_findAndSelectJRE uses the two new functions to check for such Java installations and uses them if there are any, otherwise uses the algorithm that is currently used.This would avoid duplicate code in jfw_findAndSelectJRE and getAllJREInfos.2) Add additional (out) parameters to getAllJREInfos and jfw_plugin_getAllJavaInfos that hold the JavaInfos that have been found using JAVA_HOME or PATH.possible new signature:javaPluginError jfw_plugin_getAllJavaInfos(    rtl_uString *sVendor,    rtl_uString *sMinVersion,    rtl_uString *sMaxVersion,    rtl_uString * * arExcludeList,    sal_Int32  nSizeExcludeList,    JavaInfo*** parJavaInfo,    sal_Int32 *nSizeJavaInfo,    JavaInfo** parJavaInfoFromJavaHome,    JavaInfo*** parJavaInfosFromPath,    sal_Int32 *nSizeJavaInfosFromPath);If JAVA_HOME points to a suitable Java installation, parJavaInfoFromJavaHome points to it.If suitable Java installations are on the PATH, parJavaInfosFromPath holds the respective JavaInfos and nSizeJavaInfosFromPath is the number of JavaInfos found on the PATH.The additional parameters would be unused for ""normal"" calls to the method and only be used in jfw_findAndSelectJRE (which is possibly no good design?).3) Add an additional field to the _JavaInfo struct that tells how the Java installation has been found. I currently don't have a reasonable idea how to actually implement that field - which should be able to tell e.g. that the Java installation is referred to by JAVA_HOME, and/or is the 1st Java on the PATH, the 2nd Java on the PATH,..., or has been found in a different way.As far as I understand, the struct is defined in include/jvmfwk/framework.h and the new field would thus also be visible from outside the ""jvmfwk"" module.I personally consider solution 1) to be the best of those three, but would appreciate your feedback.

3292,"Patch Set 3:When designing the framework, we had two basic ideas:- interesting document models are easier to be loaded from some format, than building them from code- checking an in-memory document model is reasonably easy (usually by using the UNO API), at least easier than asserting a written file (think of manually checking a binary .doc result)That's why for export tests, we do an import->export->import sequence. That ensures that the doc. models can be still stored in a file, allows asserting the result using the UNO API, and still export problems are detected. (I'm just re-stating what's in sw/qa/extras/README, just in case for some reason that file is not clear.) Hopefully this makes it clear how export tests are done. :-)Regarding loosing data during import/export: sure, sometimes that's necessary when e.g. our numbering types and MSO's numbering types do not match. In your case, the provided tests passed just fine when also the exporter got included in the chain, that's why I changed that. As long as it passes, it's safe to change, and it ensures that your export improvements won't break in the future silently. ;-)",3,15875,2014/11/8 15:45,2014/11/9 21:42,29,MERGED,10,104,3,6,3,0

The idea is that RTF is a no longer developed format, while OOXML still introduces new features, so RTF is a subset of OOXML. Based on that, dmapper should in general handle OOXML, and rtftok should just emit those ooxml tokens, not its own ones. So there should be as minimal RTF-specific code in dmapper as possible.About unit tests, see here for documentation: http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sw/qa/extras/READMEOne RTF, one DOC and one DOCX export test would be the optimal.Thanks! :-)",1,15897,2014/11/4 13:31,2014/11/4 13:31,0,MERGED,6,266,3,8,4,0

Once we figure out that formula, writing the code should be easy.I'm pretty sure the last time I thought about ellipses was in school a decade or so ago, so I'm not sure exactly how to do this. I can spend some time tomorrow thinking about it.

4260,"Patch Set 2:First, thanks for working on this.I am sorry, I could not test the patch easily because I do not longer work on LO and do not have the build environment at hands. So, I just react to the comments.If this patch causes that Draw behaves different way when pasting from Writer and Draw then it is even less intuitive that the previous behavior and I suggest to revert it.IMHO, it should not matter where you paste from. Also all LO appications should handle the pasting the same way.When I think about it, the confusion might be in the definition of selected object. If you select part of text in Writer and paste something, the selected text is overwritten, so writer behaves the same way as Draw.The problem is that in Writer, if no test is selected, the cursor is somewhere between two characters and pasted text is added. No text is selected most of the time when you write a text. You need to do explict action (select the text) to overwrite it.In draw, the last added or edited object is always selected, so most of the time some object is selected. This causes that the last object is overwritten when pasting. You need to do explicit action (deselect the object) to avoid overwriting.To be honest I am not sure how to solve this.PS: I am sorry if I added the comment a wrong way. I am not familiar with the current Gerrint interface. I did not find any way how to replay any existing comment.",2,18336,2013/9/7 12:00,2014/5/15 21:39,6009,MERGED,1,8,3,6,2,1

4822,"Patch Set 3:Hi Kendy,> I wonder - do we have to introduce a new flag?Of course. In some case it is useful to differentiate focusing caused by F6 or TAB. e.g. in BackingWindow::GetFocus(), GETFOCUS_F6 + !GETFOCUS_FORWARD -> grab focus to thumbnailview while GETFOCUS_TAB -> nothing> Also about removing if(GETFOCUS_TAB & GetGetFocusFlags()) - what now happens when you click there; won't it lead to extra focusing and unfocusing? Or is that unrelated?Yes, you are right. I will revert this change and will add a more explicit solution which will select item just when it is actually necessary. Unfortunately ImplGrabFocus() can't be used outside vcl, which would be a simple way (e.g. using ImplGrabFocus(GETFOCUS_F6) inside BackingWindow too).> The rest is nitpicking :-) - if we really need GETFOCUS_F6, it should be 0x0800, not 0x1000.Are you sure? I just look these GETFOCUS_ flags are defined in this way leaving out 0x0008, 0x0080 and I thought maybe somewhere these flags are used in a special way (e.g. some special bit operation) which makes it necessary.> PreNotify() should return true's, not 1's.Oh, yes.

Question is - now that 'GetNumOffset' *could* return NULL - what should be done if it *is* null ? should we set '0' to the 'SfxUInt16Item' (like I've done) ?If we're speaking about SwToSfxPageDescAttr(), what about just not putting the SfxPoolItem to the item set? Of course, then the consumer of that item set (insert->manual break dialog?) should handle the lack of the pool item in the set, but I guess that's logical: item missing -> ""change page number"" checkbox is false, item there -> ""change page number"" checkbox is true and the value can be even 0, if you need it.> In 'sw/source/ui/table/tabledlg.cxx' the code *used* to set the 'NumericField' with the value from the 'GetNumOffset()' function, but now it returns an optional value. so if the value is NULL - should it *not* set the NumericValue or it *should* set it, but with 0 (like I've done) ?This is the UI I was mentioning above. :) I guess null should be ""checkbox false, numeric field empty"", while 0 should be ""checbox true, numeric field 0"".

6473,Patch Set 5:The vigra::copyImage is not handling copy areas in the same image so the code is checking whether the src and dst are same buffer and directing it to scaleImage which is very slow.The whole concept of pixel accessors is a huge overhead in the case of direct pixel copy (vigra::copyImage is also using pixel accessors).The idea here was to identify when direct memory copy is applicable (when src.size==dst.size && src.format==dst.format) and use direct memory block copy and not pixel wise copy.The result is 100x faster than vigra implementation.This direct copy is also handling the case when the src and dst are same buffer by copy it from bottom to top when needed and using memmove instead of memcpyabout using long or int for iterating i'm not keen on the cross platform details please advice how to do it properly.,5,21135,2013/8/30 19:29,2013/9/3 22:26,98,MERGED,1,88,3,5,8,1

8501,"Patch Set 1: Verified; Looks good to me, but someone else must approveMikl├│s, thanks for your review. The simplicity of the patch is conscious. Using the character sequence ""\t"" is an artificial problem in footnote numbering, but you can specify it using standard Unicode methods, adding a zero width non joiner between ""\"" and ""t"" (U+200C).This patch fixes a real problem (*bug of the user interface* distorts the document, prohibits the stable work of a fine workaround for a long-term problem). It is not the *ideal* solution, but there were more than 10 years to fix the original problem, the missing right aligned footnote numbering, without any known result (only my Graphite solution with Linux Libertine G and Biolinum G a few years ago). I was very glad to find a general workaround not depending my particular font enhancements a few days ago, fixing it with this patch, but if you will be able to fix the original problem in a more proper way (eg. adding a check box for right alignment) for LibreOffice 4.1, I won't want to force this patch.

So I set a ""width in chars"" on the edit box to make it wide enough, that way we don't have to worry about measuring things in pixelsObjectTitleNameDialog   - Lets make it resizeable, as above.  - The original had a scrollbar, so added a scrolledwindow to it with always vertically scroll  - For the textview to give it a default height, rather than using pixels I let it take its width by expand to the above edit widget width  - For its height, added a non-translated text buffer with 5 blank lines and tweaked the ctor to set that as its permanent height request  - GtkTextView maps to class VclMultiLineEdit instead of MultiLineEdit. This is a sort of bizarre impossible to know about corner case. But they should be equivalent, so I just changed MultiLineEdit to VclMultiLineEditNameDialog:  - width requests as above  - set name_entry as the mnemonic widget of name_entryMessBox:  - I set the label to be vertically centered for the resizeable caseI've been keeping things as one dialog per .ui file, which as a side effect allows no name collisions between various ""ok"" buttons being called ""ok"", etc, so I split them up like that.",1,24490,2013/1/25 1:27,2013/1/25 1:28,0,MERGED,14,1003,1,1,2,0

11653,"Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisHmm, I am not sure that I like this change. It does not create the formatting entry without any explanation.

You will not know why the entry was not created. You will need to select everything again and again until you find why it does not work :-)IMHO, the best solution would be to preffil the range with the current selected cell(s). For example, the DataPilot or Chart is created from the current selection by default as well.Hmm, the prefil would be annoying if you lose some older formatting  in the selected cells. In this case, I would prefer to leave the behavior as is and fix it with the error dialog for 4.1.

Without that, all works fine even with the unmodified TileQueue :-)But I worked on the TileQueue too - it seems unnecessary to do all the priority shuffling when inserting, when the prioritization changes with every view switch, and instead do it only when the tile is requested - which seems to work nicely.Wrt. an own queue for tiles - that is exactly the thing that makes the synchronzation hard, as then it is necessary to synchronize between those 2 queues; which in turn kills all the advantage of 2 queues :-)Wrt. PNG compression; if we want to thread it, then let's thread just the compression - that'll make it local, more maintainable, and we can go with as many threads there as we wish (for just the PNG compression piece of code).Wrt. the 342125b8ea - thanks for that!

A footer is just the most common instance (at which point, the one instance of the page number is offset on all footers because of the footer's functionality, not the page number's functionality).Whether we eventually abandon this or not (see immediately prior comment), I'll address your inline comment.

I was a bit upset that the headless patch was merged even though the ESC asked the author not to merge it in its current form. The opengl situation on our Android port is a bit unclear. On one hand, we disable opengl in configure, OTOH it seems we build most of the opengl code in vcl. My commit just restored that status quo, fixing the build. I also verified that the build result actually works. :-)Given that at the end Android uses cairo to render the tiles, the opengl code is not useful on Android. However, probably it's a good idea to not work on removing it from the Android binary till it's not clear if those opengl #ifdefs will go away or not in the long run.

Currently all our tests don't have access to the UI configuration as it breaks the tests. Now I don't remember why I went the way of pointing the ui path to the user profile but it still seems to be necessary. Back when I wrote that code there were however no UI files so it was still so that the whole UI should have worked. Now with the UI files this is no longer true and pointing the UI config path to a place that does not the UI files causes an exception and later a crash.I will need some time to get back into the details of the configuration management during the tests.,1,25668,2016/3/21 14:48,2016/3/21 14:48,0,ABANDONED,3,60,3,7,2,1

Code might be more readable, but the issue i have seen with the current handler is the std::for_each generate a call for each cell, even if they are not formulas.

A possible work flow could be: git review -d 19292 git add setup_native/source/win32/customactions/tools/msiprop.hxx # change ../tool/msiprop.hxx to ../tools/msiprop.hxx in 	setup_native/source/win32/customactions/shellextensions/checkdirectory.cxx make setup_native git commit --amend git review -fWhether to use  git review   to push the commit or a command like  git push gerrit HEAD:refs/for/master   or our  ./logerrit submit   depends on the actual work flow you are used to and if you have the git-review plugin available. Also, if git-review does not exist on your system, you would have to download the patch by choosing in the gerrit web UI in the top right corner from Download, ""Cherry Pick"" and copy&paste that command line. Or use  ./logerrit cherry-pick 19292There are many ways to Rome ;-)Note that  git review -d 19292   creates a new branch review/melike/19292   if it doesn't exist and switches to it. The -f in  git review -f   tells it to delete the branch and switch back to master if it successfully pushed the commit to gerrit. Otherwise, when not using  git review -f   and done with the work and having pushed the commit to gerrit or wanting to abandon all together, you want to go back to master and delete the branch with  git checkout master && git branch -D review/melike/19292Hope all this helps instead of creating confusion :)Eike",1,26003,2015/10/10 0:23,2015/10/10 0:23,0,ABANDONED,6,161,3,5,2,0

Normally it means that the method implements XStatusListener UNO service, which scared me a lot, one has to be very careful introducing this :-) Having read it more carefully, it is not the case here luckily.Generally, please do not mix style changes with functional changes in the patches like this, then it looks like a much more complex change than it really is :-)  Of course it is OK to change the style of the actual lines you are touching, but when you do that for lines around too, it just makes the patch less readable.Also it is good to add comments to the places you are fixing / implementing - at least one line summary of purpose of a class is much appreciated.So I'd suggest the following: Split to more patches, where1) 1st patch turns ButtonStatusListener into VclStatusListener template liketemplate <class T> VclStatusListenerthat gets the widget as the template parameter, and calls its statusChanged() method.  In the toolbar code, the instantiation would look like mpStatusListener  = new WindowStatusListener<ToolBox>(this, "".uno:ImageOrientation"");2) 2nd that actually implements the functionality for the toolbar.3) [optionally] some style clenaup arnoud, but better to avoid doing much of that.Also - is this all that was necessary to be done to fix the problem in the sidebar, or is an additional patch anticipated?Thank you for your work on this! :-) - and sorry about my initial reaction, the stylistic changes + the wrong comment triggered a warning light in my mind ;-)",3,26082,2015/11/26 15:58,2015/11/27 9:11,17,ABANDONED,13,321,3,5,3,0

Please be the official reviewer for this patch.Markus: I'd appreciate confirmation that my coding style/choice of functions is appropriate for calc.  I didn't find example code to copy related to acting on each cell of a multi-range selection.  Undo has been a reviewers concern of late.  Perhaps if it is simple to group all the changes into a single undo that would be a good addition.  Currently each cell can be individually ÔÇ£undoneÔÇØ, which is fine with me.  I don't think it is worth extra effort if the code is complicated, or if it involves a translation effort.  Finally, there are already alt-x unit-tests for Writer, so I didn't think it was necessary to add one for calc as well.

12797,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1So, as-is this compiles ... and crashes/asserts for now -- at least with a debug build.There have been some attempts to use unique_ptrs or scoped_ptrs on SwUnoCrsr -- however, as these are kept as naked pointer in SwUnoCrsrTbl too, which mindlessly deletes everything it still finds around on ~SwDoc, the ownership of these is a terrible mess.I'd suggest to use the blunt device of a shared_ptr as a starting point (and a weak_ptr in SwUnoCrsrTbl) to get somewhat sensible ownership of these in the mid-term.In the long run, the users of the SwUnoCrsrTbl should likely be listeners to all the SwUnoCrsrs (registered right in CreateUnoCrsr) and thus removing the need for having a SwUnoCrsrTbl in the first place.

12872,"Patch Set 2: Code-Review-2(3 comments)I just had a quick look at this mailmerge.py ... not pretty.BTW: you can drop the resolves from the commit message - just start with tdf#63388.Now for your patch.Normally one should try (in this order of preference): 1. StartTLS: SMTP + EHLO, check for STARTTLS and establish TLS (normally on port 25 or 587) 2. SSL/TLS: SMTP_S_ without STARTTLS (normally on port 465). This should directly start encrypted (SMTP_SSL)! 3. Insecure: SMTP (as 1.)The ports are just the well known ports, but servers can run on any.In the case of the SSL setting from LO, I would just probe 1 and 2 and skip 3. But feel free to update the GUI and add StartTLS.To be technically clear without probing one would need all three options: Insecure, Ssl and StartTLS.And note there is also the POP3 and IMAP code in this file, which should be unified in handling the connection setup. I'm not sure this is actually used. At the end all protocols offer the same three options.Anyway - you don't need to fix these too ;-)OTOH I'm unable to really test this.

13075,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1(1 comment)Hi Yogesh, thanks for looking into this.I was worried about the change to wrtw8sty.cxx so I had a bit of a look at the bug myself to understand it better.  I found two different issues which contribute:- the import from docx appears to have a bug which is at play here: when I open the docx in LibreOffice I see that the first page footer has wrong spacing. This affects the export code which tries to join chained page styles into a single word section if they match.  The import bug means that they do not match, so it will try to export this as two different word sections.- however some code recently added to ww8/ww8atr.cxx in a31fbb53dba7 prevents the output of a new section at the page break in this case, as the paragraph on the first page is empty             if( isTextNodeEmpty )                bNewPageDesc = false;So I think these are the two issues that need to be addressed, rather than the change proposed in this item.

The hyphenation active check box is checked again which the user would need to uncheck for the 2nd time.

13531,"Patch Set 1:Hi Tor,The remove-and-rebuild test is indeed the criteria that I'm using. There's too many files to check by hand so a automated or at least semi-automated approach is necessary.Anyway, thanks for the comments! I hadn't thought about indirect inclusion. How about this refined approach:For each .cxx file,1) Use the brute-force approach to find candidate headers for removal, and use ""g++ -H"" to dump out a full list of all included headers 2) If a candidate header shows up *once* in the list from g++ -H, it's definitely unnecessary and we remove it. If it shows up more than once (via indirect inclusion), then we leave it alone for now.This should give a smaller list of includes to remove, or in the case of no indirect inclusions, the same list.Are there any other pitfalls that are worth looking out for?

13738,"Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisHi Mathias,first thanks for your patch. It is great start; Well, it does some non-standard things. I suggest to re-shufle it a bit :-)1. You already mentioned that you were unsure about    downloading the files inside configure. I suggest to   do it using the download script.   You might already see the many @FILENAME@ entries in   ooo.lst.in. They are optional. If you do not define such    variable in configure, it will be empty in the generated    ooo.lst file and it will not be downloaded.2. If you use download, it will get the files into the   $TARFILE_LOCATION instead of $SRC_ROOT/moz/zipped.      I suggest to modify the related makefiles in ""moz""    module to find the .zip archives in $TARFILE_LOCATION   Note that this approach follows the current trends.   In the past, we copied many 3rd party tarballs into   the related build subdirectories. We do not longer   do it. We already updated most makefiles to unpack the    tarballs directly from the $TARFILE_LOCATION.   3. I suggest to do not copy the dlls in configure because    it is not typical. Instead, I suggest to define variables   that will point to the files. Then you could copy the   files in the makefile that need to use the dlls.4. Please, do not remove the TABs from configure.in from    lines 4469-4515. These lines are copied into ""Makefile""    that is later tested. TABs are important in Makefiles,   so your change breaks this test.Thanks a lot for working on it. Feel free to ask if you are in doubts.",1,27953,2012/10/14 21:24,2012/10/14 21:24,0,ABANDONED,1,67,2,2,1,0

13747,"Patch Set 1: Do not submitHmm, I am confused by all the changes:1. In the dmake fix, it does not make sense to save   the number of read items and just increment it.      Instead, it would make sense to check if it really   did read the item, for example:      if (fread( (char *)&flhdr, sizeof(flhdr), 1, f ) != 1) return (-1);   2. In the lpsolve fix, it is not a good idea to redirect all   error messages to /dev/null. It would hide real build   errors as well.      Instead, it would be better to fix the lpsolve code   to do not produce warnigns at all.3. The concat-deps.c is strange as well. It is a similar   problem like in dmake.      IMHO, we need to return an error if it does not write   the whole item => you need to modify the function   print_fullpaths to return integer instead of void.   Then you could use something like:      if (fwrite(token, token_len, 1, stdout) != 1) return EIO;      Of course, you need to handle the print_fullpaths return   value where it is called.",1,27966,2012/10/18 23:44,2012/10/18 23:44,0,ABANDONED,3,21,2,2,3,1
13748,"Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisI am sorry for the late response. I am busy with preparing the tag for 3.6.3-rc3.Hmm, I still do not like your solution. In short:1. It would be better to squash all the commits into one. It is easier to review. Also it would help if you later investigate the git history. You could use     git rebase -i origin/master   and follow the instructions2. You patch hides potential errors using thatif( function_call(...) ) ; construct . It means that the application could proceed random data. Instead, it should propagate the errors. For example, it should return (-1) in dmake if it was not able to read the data.

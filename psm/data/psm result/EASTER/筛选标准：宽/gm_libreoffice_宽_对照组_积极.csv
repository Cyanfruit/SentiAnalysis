When changing the state, the layout is invalidated and the the default logic of repaginating and page-layout does its thing on next idle timer event. So changing this behavior will affect others as well.

About the insert point to decode URL.As you wrote, I think that the best way to convert is in PasswordDialog ctor.However, to reduce the influence I now was according to the method for the other formats(odf,etc...).For the other formats, probably insert points to decode URL are just before calling the UNO API, Document(MS)PasswordRequest(2). (e.g.   http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sfx2/source/appl/appopen.cxx#245  http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sw/source/filter/ww8/ww8par.cxx#5468)Somehow, those APIs want ""the name of the document""... Therefore, in the case of OOXML, I think that the insert point to decode URL is either within MediaDescriptor::requestAndVerifyDocPassword() in unotools or DocPasswordHelper::requestAndVerifyDocPassword() in comphelper.Because the latter point has a smaller effect, I will modify the patch.(I think in the comphelper, INetURLObject can not be used because of the module dependencies.

Good to know. The reason I wrote this script is because I have another patch that improves pch generation (a rewrite of update_pch in python that updates every single pch in the codebase in a few seconds). It was obvious to me that to improve the pch generation to make builds faster I had to deal with the problem of conflicting headers (that are excluded from pch) and required headers (that will break the build if left out). This script solves the latter problem, so now what is included in pch headers is purely to accelerate builds, not to prevent the build from breaking.Will submit the update_pch script and updated pch files sometime soon, as time permits.",1,11103,2015/9/1 0:33,2015/9/1 0:33,0,MERGED,16,378,4,6,2,positive

2709,"Patch Set 8: Code-Review-1The import part looks good, and functions very well.  Great job on doing your analysis and coming up with a very well thought-out solution.Now, the only remaining issue is the saving.  Right now, when you open a csv.gz file, edits it, and hits Ctrl-S, it saves it back to the file uncompressed, while the extension is intact.  This is not ideal.I can think of 2 ways to resolve this.  The first way is to support saving it back gz compressed, by somehow storing the information that this file has been uncompressed and using that information and trigger gz compression on saving.  In this scenario, you need to be careful not to compress on save when the user decides to save the file with a different name.  There would be other corner cases you'd have to handle when going this route. Personally I don't like this solution.The 2nd way is to load the file read only when the file is automatically uncompressed during file detection.  This way, when the user wants to edit it and re-save it, she won't be able to overwrite the original file.  I personally like this solution.Here is the gotcha, though.  Forcing a read-only load is as easy as setting the read only flag to true with the media descriptor, which will prompt you that the document has been opened read only, and to edit it, the user will need to click ""Edit document"" to create a new document instance.  When you do that, Calc will still load the compressed stream into the 2nd document instance, not the uncompressed version.  This needs to be addressed.I hope this will not be too much trouble to solve.  Good luck!",8,13520,2015/4/15 16:52,2015/4/20 15:06,118,MERGED,3,46,2,3,10,positive

Could you make the change for that and update your patch?  I'd like to give that a spin.One very minor thing I would change is to switch from replaceFirst() to copy() to get a substring of the original URL in order to remove the .gz extension.  Using replaceFirst is fine, but I personally find using the copy() method more ""natural"" for that sort of use given that you already have the position of the "".gz"" string.  You can use nIdx as the ""length"" of the new substring when using copy().Thanks a lot!",8,13520,2015/4/15 16:52,2015/4/20 15:06,118,MERGED,3,46,2,3,10,positive

2820,"Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1The patch looks completely reasonable from the POV of the current state of the code. However, code archaeology suggests that merge commit 67d2af6fac2d9bad52a6b1f6e0cbd1229eb88a42 erroneously removed the call to ""ImplUpdate"" in MoveItem, since that line is present in BOTH parents of that merge. The ""if ( nNewPos < nPos )"" seems to be done for the sake of the ImplUpdate, to set the argument it will be called with. It looks reasonable, since the call is made with the default value of bDirect==false, then ImplUpdate updates *all* columns after its first argument (its argument inclusive). So it is essentially called with ::std::min(nPos, nNewPos).So it seems to me that we should rather fix the error in bd24a310be1459510b760b812838cb87923853c5 of using ""nPos"" instead of ""nNewPos"" in the second call of ::std::advance (the one before insert), but leave the ""if ( nNewPos < nPos )"" and reinsert the ""ImplUpdate(nPos, ...)"".Kendy, I know it is far away, but would you agree with my analysis of your merge commit?Julien, could you try out my suggestion above and test its effects, if the behaviour is good, the bug is still fixed, no other obvious bug is introduced, etc?

3077,"Patch Set 1:Thank you very much for your feedback and your hints!I have thought about how to best implement this and would appreciate your feedback on my ideas.The possibilities I am currently thinking about are as follows:1) Add two new functions (e.g. ""jfw_plugin_getJavaInfoFromJavaHome"", ""jfw_plugin_getJavaInfosFromPath"") to vendorplugin.hxx and sunjavaplugin.cxx to obtain information about Java installations referred to by JAVA_HOME and PATH environment variables (similar to jfw_plugin_getAllJavaInfos). The two functions use the functions in util.cxx to get the information.jfw_findAndSelectJRE uses the two new functions to check for such Java installations and uses them if there are any, otherwise uses the algorithm that is currently used.This would avoid duplicate code in jfw_findAndSelectJRE and getAllJREInfos.2) Add additional (out) parameters to getAllJREInfos and jfw_plugin_getAllJavaInfos that hold the JavaInfos that have been found using JAVA_HOME or PATH.possible new signature:javaPluginError jfw_plugin_getAllJavaInfos(    rtl_uString *sVendor,    rtl_uString *sMinVersion,    rtl_uString *sMaxVersion,    rtl_uString * * arExcludeList,    sal_Int32  nSizeExcludeList,    JavaInfo*** parJavaInfo,    sal_Int32 *nSizeJavaInfo,    JavaInfo** parJavaInfoFromJavaHome,    JavaInfo*** parJavaInfosFromPath,    sal_Int32 *nSizeJavaInfosFromPath);If JAVA_HOME points to a suitable Java installation, parJavaInfoFromJavaHome points to it.If suitable Java installations are on the PATH, parJavaInfosFromPath holds the respective JavaInfos and nSizeJavaInfosFromPath is the number of JavaInfos found on the PATH.The additional parameters would be unused for ""normal"" calls to the method and only be used in jfw_findAndSelectJRE (which is possibly no good design?).3) Add an additional field to the _JavaInfo struct that tells how the Java installation has been found. I currently don't have a reasonable idea how to actually implement that field - which should be able to tell e.g. that the Java installation is referred to by JAVA_HOME, and/or is the 1st Java on the PATH, the 2nd Java on the PATH,..., or has been found in a different way.As far as I understand, the struct is defined in include/jvmfwk/framework.h and the new field would thus also be visible from outside the ""jvmfwk"" module.I personally consider solution 1) to be the best of those three, but would appreciate your feedback. Of course, a totally different solution is welcome, too.",1,15251,2014/9/10 12:56,2014/9/11 8:26,19,MERGED,2,410,2,5,3,positive

11653,"Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisHmm, I am not sure that I like this change. It does not create the formatting entry without any explanation. You were able to edit the unused formatting and add the range later in the past.For example, imagine that you define some formatting, forget to define the range, and press the ""Add"" button. You will not know why the entry was not created. You will need to select everything again and again until you find why it does not work :-)IMHO, the best solution would be to preffil the range with the current selected cell(s). For example, the DataPilot or Chart is created from the current selection by default as well.Hmm, the prefil would be annoying if you lose some older formatting  in the selected cells. In this case, I would prefer to leave the behavior as is and fix it with the error dialog for 4.1.

In the toolbar code, the instantiation would look like mpStatusListener  = new WindowStatusListener<ToolBox>(this, "".uno:ImageOrientation"");2) 2nd that actually implements the functionality for the toolbar.3) [optionally] some style clenaup arnoud, but better to avoid doing much of that.Also - is this all that was necessary to be done to fix the problem in the sidebar, or is an additional patch anticipated?Thank you for your work on this! :-) - and sorry about my initial reaction, the stylistic changes + the wrong comment triggered a warning light in my mind ;-)",3,26082,2015/11/26 15:58,2015/11/27 9:11,17,ABANDONED,13,321,3,5,3,positive

13075,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1(1 comment)Hi Yogesh, thanks for looking into this.I was worried about the change to wrtw8sty.cxx so I had a bit of a look at the bug myself to understand it better.  I found two different issues which contribute:- the import from docx appears to have a bug which is at play here: when I open the docx in LibreOffice I see that the first page footer has wrong spacing. This affects the export code which tries to join chained page styles into a single word section if they match.  The import bug means that they do not match, so it will try to export this as two different word sections.- however some code recently added to ww8/ww8atr.cxx in a31fbb53dba7 prevents the output of a new section at the page break in this case, as the paragraph on the first page is empty             if( isTextNodeEmpty )                bNewPageDesc = false;So I think these are the two issues that need to be addressed, rather than the change proposed in this item.  Fixing either one of them will solve the reported issue for this document, but it would be great to fix both.",1,27019,2014/7/11 11:44,2014/7/11 12:53,1,ABANDONED,7,31,2,6,2,positive

There's too many files to check by hand so a automated or at least semi-automated approach is necessary.Anyway, thanks for the comments! I hadn't thought about indirect inclusion. How about this refined approach:For each .cxx file,1) Use the brute-force approach to find candidate headers for removal, and use ""g++ -H"" to dump out a full list of all included headers 2) If a candidate header shows up *once* in the list from g++ -H, it's definitely unnecessary and we remove it. If it shows up more than once (via indirect inclusion), then we leave it alone for now.This should give a smaller list of includes to remove, or in the case of no indirect inclusions, the same list.Are there any other pitfalls that are worth looking out for?

All the final binaries that are built are moved into the solver, all the inter-module headers we compile against are located in the solver.The hope is that completing the gnumake work will kill the solver - and we can use the workdir/ instead - which has a friendlier name - and (hopefully) run the app directly out of that.Any chance you could re-work the README's and submit a new patch ?

13738,"Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisHi Mathias,first thanks for your patch. It is great start; Well, it does some non-standard things. I suggest to re-shufle it a bit :-)1. You already mentioned that you were unsure about    downloading the files inside configure. I suggest to   do it using the download script.   You might already see the many @FILENAME@ entries in   ooo.lst.in. They are optional. If you do not define such    variable in configure, it will be empty in the generated    ooo.lst file and it will not be downloaded.2. If you use download, it will get the files into the   $TARFILE_LOCATION instead of $SRC_ROOT/moz/zipped.      I suggest to modify the related makefiles in ""moz""    module to find the .zip archives in $TARFILE_LOCATION   Note that this approach follows the current trends.   In the past, we copied many 3rd party tarballs into   the related build subdirectories. We do not longer   do it. We already updated most makefiles to unpack the    tarballs directly from the $TARFILE_LOCATION.   3. I suggest to do not copy the dlls in configure because    it is not typical. Instead, I suggest to define variables   that will point to the files. Then you could copy the   files in the makefile that need to use the dlls.4. Please, do not remove the TABs from configure.in from    lines 4469-4515. These lines are copied into ""Makefile""    that is later tested. TABs are important in Makefiles,   so your change breaks this test.Thanks a lot for working on it. Feel free to ask if you are in doubts.",1,27953,2012/10/14 21:24,2012/10/14 21:24,0,ABANDONED,1,67,2,2,1,positive

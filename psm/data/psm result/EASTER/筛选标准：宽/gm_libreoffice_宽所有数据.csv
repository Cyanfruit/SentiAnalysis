621,Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1(1 comment)This commit needs to be split into at least 2 if not more patches.This mixes so many things (even if they are all related to validation). E.g. I'm unhappy with the DOCX part in the chart test unless someone is going to maintain them. I'm happy to maintain the calc parts and as far as I know I'm the only one really caring about the chart tests.At least all the non binary validation changes in the chart code need to go into an independent patch that can be discussed independently. With the current chart change this -1 should be seen as meaning a -2 with the chance to remove the -1 by splitting the unrelated parts into an own commit.For the calc part it is surely not the best idea to add uncommented code when are actually discouraging that. Hide it behind a ifdef or something like that to make it clearer that it is actually useful and should not be removed directly.,5,4211,2016/6/3 14:39,2016/6/10 15:33,168,MERGED,11,156,4,5,7,negative

762,"Patch Set 2:Hi Faruk,Thanks for working on this, it looks awesome, except I have few comments that I think should be taken care of before we merge this. What do you think ?1. tpstatus label is obscured; not clearly visible. Maybe better if we add a background below this label, or something to make it visible clearly ?2. It should be possible to close the dialog when user clicks somewhere else. Currently, only way to close the dialog is to hit again on the toolbar button.3. I think we should limit the dimensions of table user can create with this new toolbar button just like we do in desktop, because if we don't it would stick to the mouse movements and user will have a hard time to find an empty space to close the dialog button. This is pretty annoying from user POV, I think.4. I noticed that the state of this new toolbar button doesn't get reset whenever user manages to close the dialog. So for eg: if user closed the dialog with table dimensions 12 x 12 selected, the next time he opens it, it would still be at 12 x 12. The state should be reset everytime dialog is closed.5. Currently, user has to move his mouse slowly to select desired dimensions. If he moves the mouse little faster, the dialog doesn't notice that.6. You have limited the width of dialog unlike its height. I think you intend to limit the number of columns user can choose here (?), _but_ if user moves his mouse back and forth near the right edge, more number of columns gets added to the same width increasing the number of cells per row - density - which makes the grid a mess. Can we somehow avoid that ? Also as pointed out in (3) limiting number of rows makes sense here.Besides these, I found a missing '+' (see inline comments which makes me suspect this is not the version you have in your local box since this version doesn't work out of the box unless someone changes code himself - is it ?)",2,5101,2016/5/1 12:07,2016/5/1 12:21,0,MERGED,3,99,2,5,3,negative

Then only add the new commit to the push tree (which already contains the pushed commit) and push to gerrit for review.Gerrit complained that you tried to push a patch that has been merged already to gerrit review.

I tried that. And can give it another try. But it would require a much bigger change, obviously. The main problem is that wingdi.h is actually included from other windows headers too. So we can't fully control when it's included. But can give it another shot and narrow it down further. In fact, I spent hours trying to find what file includes the conflicting values to create this patch. > The current fix allows workdir/CustomTarget/officecfg/registry/officecfg/Office/Common.hxx > to be included, but if a source file happens to first include that > officecfg/Office/Common.hxx, then include wingdi.h, and later wants > to acutally use the struct RGB from Common.hxx, it still runs into > a problem.Well, that would be be a problem _only_ if wingdi.h was already included _before_ Office/Common.h, and in that case the build would fail because the macro would conflict with the declaration of RGB (my patch avoids this situation).However, if wingdi.h was _not_ included at the point of #undef RGB, then nothing bad would happen if it is included afterwards. Unless I missed something, I don't see how there would still be a problem, as wingdi.h will define RGB without issue.I should add that I hated this particular line of my patch.

The timing of this instigates doubt that one of the reasons is to level down the Win32 and Win64 versions to the same feature set.As to ""could be rewritten from scratch"", yes, it could; the absence of activity on bugs 56903 56905 and 57322 suggests that we don't have the volunteer manpower to do that.

When changing the state, the layout is invalidated and the the default logic of repaginating and page-layout does its thing on next idle timer event. So changing this behavior will affect others as well.

1954,"Patch Set 3:(1 comment)Thank you for your advice.I also think that the variable name ""aDocumentName"" is very misleading.1. About the insert point to decode URL.As you wrote, I think that the best way to convert is in PasswordDialog ctor.However, to reduce the influence I now was according to the method for the other formats(odf,etc...).For the other formats, probably insert points to decode URL are just before calling the UNO API, Document(MS)PasswordRequest(2). (e.g.   http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sfx2/source/appl/appopen.cxx#245  http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sw/source/filter/ww8/ww8par.cxx#5468)Somehow, those APIs want ""the name of the document""... Therefore, in the case of OOXML, I think that the insert point to decode URL is either within MediaDescriptor::requestAndVerifyDocPassword() in unotools or DocPasswordHelper::requestAndVerifyDocPassword() in comphelper.Because the latter point has a smaller effect, I will modify the patch.(I think in the comphelper, INetURLObject can not be used because of the module dependencies. So, I will call directly rtl::url::decode().)2. About decodeMechanism for converting URL.I tried the two ways of rtl_UriDecodeWithCharset and rtl_UriDecodeToIuriRI, I have attached screen shots to bug report tdf#89694.https://bug-attachments.documentfoundation.org/attachment.cgi?id=113966https://bug-attachments.documentfoundation.org/attachment.cgi?id=113967I used this patch.https://bug-attachments.documentfoundation.org/attachment.cgi?id=113965I think the case in rtl_UriDecodeWithCharset is more user-friendly.If I mistake,  please point out.",3,10153,2015/2/28 8:43,2015/2/28 11:46,3,MERGED,1,5,3,9,6,positive

Good to know. The reason I wrote this script is because I have another patch that improves pch generation (a rewrite of update_pch in python that updates every single pch in the codebase in a few seconds). It was obvious to me that to improve the pch generation to make builds faster I had to deal with the problem of conflicting headers (that are excluded from pch) and required headers (that will break the build if left out). This script solves the latter problem, so now what is included in pch headers is purely to accelerate builds, not to prevent the build from breaking.Will submit the update_pch script and updated pch files sometime soon, as time permits.",1,11103,2015/9/1 0:33,2015/9/1 0:33,0,MERGED,16,378,4,6,2,positive

I've looked at what other fields do and some (e.g. page number SvxPageField) don't save the real content of the field either, but use a placeholder.

2709,"Patch Set 8: Code-Review-1The import part looks good, and functions very well.  Great job on doing your analysis and coming up with a very well thought-out solution.Now, the only remaining issue is the saving.  Right now, when you open a csv.gz file, edits it, and hits Ctrl-S, it saves it back to the file uncompressed, while the extension is intact.  This is not ideal.I can think of 2 ways to resolve this.  The first way is to support saving it back gz compressed, by somehow storing the information that this file has been uncompressed and using that information and trigger gz compression on saving.  In this scenario, you need to be careful not to compress on save when the user decides to save the file with a different name.  There would be other corner cases you'd have to handle when going this route. Personally I don't like this solution.The 2nd way is to load the file read only when the file is automatically uncompressed during file detection.  This way, when the user wants to edit it and re-save it, she won't be able to overwrite the original file.  I personally like this solution.Here is the gotcha, though.  Forcing a read-only load is as easy as setting the read only flag to true with the media descriptor, which will prompt you that the document has been opened read only, and to edit it, the user will need to click ""Edit document"" to create a new document instance.  When you do that, Calc will still load the compressed stream into the 2nd document instance, not the uncompressed version.  This needs to be addressed.I hope this will not be too much trouble to solve.  Good luck!",8,13520,2015/4/15 16:52,2015/4/20 15:06,118,MERGED,3,46,2,3,10,positive

I'd like to give that a spin.One very minor thing I would change is to switch from replaceFirst() to copy() to get a substring of the original URL in order to remove the .gz extension.  Using replaceFirst is fine, but I personally find using the copy() method more ""natural"" for that sort of use given that you already have the position of the "".gz"" string.  You can use nIdx as the ""length"" of the new substring when using copy().Thanks a lot!",8,13520,2015/4/15 16:52,2015/4/20 15:06,118,MERGED,3,46,2,3,10,positive

2820,"Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1The patch looks completely reasonable from the POV of the current state of the code. However, code archaeology suggests that merge commit 67d2af6fac2d9bad52a6b1f6e0cbd1229eb88a42 erroneously removed the call to ""ImplUpdate"" in MoveItem, since that line is present in BOTH parents of that merge. The ""if ( nNewPos < nPos )"" seems to be done for the sake of the ImplUpdate, to set the argument it will be called with. It looks reasonable, since the call is made with the default value of bDirect==false, then ImplUpdate updates *all* columns after its first argument (its argument inclusive). So it is essentially called with ::std::min(nPos, nNewPos).So it seems to me that we should rather fix the error in bd24a310be1459510b760b812838cb87923853c5 of using ""nPos"" instead of ""nNewPos"" in the second call of ::std::advance (the one before insert), but leave the ""if ( nNewPos < nPos )"" and reinsert the ""ImplUpdate(nPos, ...)"".Kendy, I know it is far away, but would you agree with my analysis of your merge commit?Julien, could you try out my suggestion above and test its effects, if the behaviour is good, the bug is still fixed, no other obvious bug is introduced, etc?

3077,"Patch Set 1:Thank you very much for your feedback and your hints!I have thought about how to best implement this and would appreciate your feedback on my ideas.The possibilities I am currently thinking about are as follows:1) Add two new functions (e.g. ""jfw_plugin_getJavaInfoFromJavaHome"", ""jfw_plugin_getJavaInfosFromPath"") to vendorplugin.hxx and sunjavaplugin.cxx to obtain information about Java installations referred to by JAVA_HOME and PATH environment variables (similar to jfw_plugin_getAllJavaInfos). The two functions use the functions in util.cxx to get the information.jfw_findAndSelectJRE uses the two new functions to check for such Java installations and uses them if there are any, otherwise uses the algorithm that is currently used.This would avoid duplicate code in jfw_findAndSelectJRE and getAllJREInfos.2) Add additional (out) parameters to getAllJREInfos and jfw_plugin_getAllJavaInfos that hold the JavaInfos that have been found using JAVA_HOME or PATH.possible new signature:javaPluginError jfw_plugin_getAllJavaInfos(    rtl_uString *sVendor,    rtl_uString *sMinVersion,    rtl_uString *sMaxVersion,    rtl_uString * * arExcludeList,    sal_Int32  nSizeExcludeList,    JavaInfo*** parJavaInfo,    sal_Int32 *nSizeJavaInfo,    JavaInfo** parJavaInfoFromJavaHome,    JavaInfo*** parJavaInfosFromPath,    sal_Int32 *nSizeJavaInfosFromPath);If JAVA_HOME points to a suitable Java installation, parJavaInfoFromJavaHome points to it.If suitable Java installations are on the PATH, parJavaInfosFromPath holds the respective JavaInfos and nSizeJavaInfosFromPath is the number of JavaInfos found on the PATH.The additional parameters would be unused for ""normal"" calls to the method and only be used in jfw_findAndSelectJRE (which is possibly no good design?).3) Add an additional field to the _JavaInfo struct that tells how the Java installation has been found. I currently don't have a reasonable idea how to actually implement that field - which should be able to tell e.g. that the Java installation is referred to by JAVA_HOME, and/or is the 1st Java on the PATH, the 2nd Java on the PATH,..., or has been found in a different way.As far as I understand, the struct is defined in include/jvmfwk/framework.h and the new field would thus also be visible from outside the ""jvmfwk"" module.I personally consider solution 1) to be the best of those three, but would appreciate your feedback.

So, I just react to the comments.If this patch causes that Draw behaves different way when pasting from Writer and Draw then it is even less intuitive that the previous behavior and I suggest to revert it.IMHO, it should not matter where you paste from. Also all LO appications should handle the pasting the same way.When I think about it, the confusion might be in the definition of selected object. If you select part of text in Writer and paste something, the selected text is overwritten, so writer behaves the same way as Draw.The problem is that in Writer, if no test is selected, the cursor is somewhere between two characters and pasted text is added. No text is selected most of the time when you write a text. You need to do explict action (select the text) to overwrite it.In draw, the last added or edited object is always selected, so most of the time some object is selected. This causes that the last object is overwritten when pasting. You need to do explicit action (deselect the object) to avoid overwriting.To be honest I am not sure how to solve this.PS: I am sorry if I added the comment a wrong way. I am not familiar with the current Gerrint interface. I did not find any way how to replay any existing comment.",2,18336,2013/9/7 12:00,2014/5/15 21:39,6009,MERGED,1,8,3,6,2,negative

I was a bit upset that the headless patch was merged even though the ESC asked the author not to merge it in its current form. The opengl situation on our Android port is a bit unclear. On one hand, we disable opengl in configure, OTOH it seems we build most of the opengl code in vcl. My commit just restored that status quo, fixing the build. I also verified that the build result actually works. :-)Given that at the end Android uses cairo to render the tiles, the opengl code is not useful on Android. However, probably it's a good idea to not work on removing it from the Android binary till it's not clear if those opengl #ifdefs will go away or not in the long run.

Back when I wrote that code there were however no UI files so it was still so that the whole UI should have worked. Now with the UI files this is no longer true and pointing the UI config path to a place that does not the UI files causes an exception and later a crash.I will need some time to get back into the details of the configuration management during the tests.,1,25668,2016/3/21 14:48,2016/3/21 14:48,0,ABANDONED,3,60,3,7,2,negative

Code might be more readable, but the issue i have seen with the current handler is the std::for_each generate a call for each cell, even if they are not formulas.

In the toolbar code, the instantiation would look like mpStatusListener  = new WindowStatusListener<ToolBox>(this, "".uno:ImageOrientation"");2) 2nd that actually implements the functionality for the toolbar.3) [optionally] some style clenaup arnoud, but better to avoid doing much of that.Also - is this all that was necessary to be done to fix the problem in the sidebar, or is an additional patch anticipated?Thank you for your work on this! :-) - and sorry about my initial reaction, the stylistic changes + the wrong comment triggered a warning light in my mind ;-)",3,26082,2015/11/26 15:58,2015/11/27 9:11,17,ABANDONED,13,321,3,5,3,positive

I don't think it is worth extra effort if the code is complicated, or if it involves a translation effort.

The decision was made, among other reasons perhaps, on the basis that it was a more malleable icon theme (with sources available and compatible with our license) which we could modify to suit our needs.

13075,"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1(1 comment)Hi Yogesh, thanks for looking into this.I was worried about the change to wrtw8sty.cxx so I had a bit of a look at the bug myself to understand it better.  I found two different issues which contribute:- the import from docx appears to have a bug which is at play here: when I open the docx in LibreOffice I see that the first page footer has wrong spacing. This affects the export code which tries to join chained page styles into a single word section if they match.  The import bug means that they do not match, so it will try to export this as two different word sections.- however some code recently added to ww8/ww8atr.cxx in a31fbb53dba7 prevents the output of a new section at the page break in this case, as the paragraph on the first page is empty             if( isTextNodeEmpty )                bNewPageDesc = false;So I think these are the two issues that need to be addressed, rather than the change proposed in this item.

The hyphenation active check box is checked again which the user would need to uncheck for the 2nd time.  That's not very user friendly.The better approach is to have the ""hyphenation active"" check box *on by default* in the UI, but no other changes.I *believe* you can specify the default state of a check box in the .ui file.

How about this refined approach:For each .cxx file,1) Use the brute-force approach to find candidate headers for removal, and use ""g++ -H"" to dump out a full list of all included headers 2) If a candidate header shows up *once* in the list from g++ -H, it's definitely unnecessary and we remove it. If it shows up more than once (via indirect inclusion), then we leave it alone for now.This should give a smaller list of includes to remove, or in the case of no indirect inclusions, the same list.Are there any other pitfalls that are worth looking out for?

13738,"Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisHi Mathias,first thanks for your patch. It is great start; Well, it does some non-standard things. I suggest to re-shufle it a bit :-)1. You already mentioned that you were unsure about    downloading the files inside configure. I suggest to   do it using the download script.   You might already see the many @FILENAME@ entries in   ooo.lst.in. They are optional. If you do not define such    variable in configure, it will be empty in the generated    ooo.lst file and it will not be downloaded.2. If you use download, it will get the files into the   $TARFILE_LOCATION instead of $SRC_ROOT/moz/zipped.      I suggest to modify the related makefiles in ""moz""    module to find the .zip archives in $TARFILE_LOCATION   Note that this approach follows the current trends.   In the past, we copied many 3rd party tarballs into   the related build subdirectories. We do not longer   do it. We already updated most makefiles to unpack the    tarballs directly from the $TARFILE_LOCATION.   3. I suggest to do not copy the dlls in configure because    it is not typical. Instead, I suggest to define variables   that will point to the files. Then you could copy the   files in the makefile that need to use the dlls.4. Please, do not remove the TABs from configure.in from    lines 4469-4515. These lines are copied into ""Makefile""    that is later tested. TABs are important in Makefiles,   so your change breaks this test.Thanks a lot for working on it. Feel free to ask if you are in doubts.",1,27953,2012/10/14 21:24,2012/10/14 21:24,0,ABANDONED,1,67,2,2,1,positive

13747,"Patch Set 1: Do not submitHmm, I am confused by all the changes:1. In the dmake fix, it does not make sense to save   the number of read items and just increment it.      Instead, it would make sense to check if it really   did read the item, for example:      if (fread( (char *)&flhdr, sizeof(flhdr), 1, f ) != 1) return (-1);   2. In the lpsolve fix, it is not a good idea to redirect all   error messages to /dev/null. It would hide real build   errors as well.      Instead, it would be better to fix the lpsolve code   to do not produce warnigns at all.3. The concat-deps.c is strange as well. It is a similar   problem like in dmake.      IMHO, we need to return an error if it does not write   the whole item => you need to modify the function   print_fullpaths to return integer instead of void.   Then you could use something like:      if (fwrite(token, token_len, 1, stdout) != 1) return EIO;      Of course, you need to handle the print_fullpaths return   value where it is called.",1,27966,2012/10/18 23:44,2012/10/18 23:44,0,ABANDONED,3,21,2,2,3,negative
13748,"Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisI am sorry for the late response. I am busy with preparing the tag for 3.6.3-rc3.Hmm, I still do not like your solution. In short:1. It would be better to squash all the commits into one. It is easier to review. Also it would help if you later investigate the git history. You could use     git rebase -i origin/master   and follow the instructions2. You patch hides potential errors using thatif( function_call(...) ) ; construct . It means that the application could proceed random data. Instead, it should propagate the errors. For example, it should return (-1) in dmake if it was not able to read the data.

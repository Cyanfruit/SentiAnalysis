Having a history buffer of 2 billion lines and then copying it to a StringBuilder is not efficient.Before making any changes I would like to hear your opinion on it,        * Shall we reduce the maximum history buffer ?        * What about using a single instance of StringBuilder and use it to write to the OutputStream in chunks of e.g. 1000 lines,  We can re-use the same StringBuilder instance and set its length to zero at the beginning of each iteration. So making sure the size of the builder does not go beyond the chunk size.        * Any more ideas ?""",1
207,Patch Set 4:I think this is a serious concern.  I hadn't thought of it before.We should look at how the platform console does this.  You can clone the platform console view and each new console will be filled with all the text.  Our TracingConsole class (gdb traces) does this by extending IOConsole.  How do they do this efficiently.  I think they use some kinds of scheme using a document.,0
208,Patch Set 4:The concern mentioned in patch set 4 is now minimized by limiting the size of the history buffer.   A more robust implementation shall be investigated as a separate story.  In the mean time the user experience would be improved by providing a reasonable size of console history,1

Also, if I start typing something but don't press <enter>, then close the view, then re-open it, what I typed is not shown, but when I press <enter>, what I type is used.That second use-case is not that important, but it would be nice to show the (gdb) prompt if possible.""",1

The code if (isInterrupted()) {   continue; }is broken. Luckily it's straightforward to fix: https://git.eclipse.org/r/84513""",1

If the buffer contains some data, it returns that data without waiting for more.We don't flush until readInterrupted is true. That means we don't flush until the pipe is drained.""",1

How are we going to > assure that the qualifier increases (so that osgi versioning > checking works as expected)?From a p2 perspective, the qualifiers will look the same for releases and snapshots.The idea with the tycho build is that the qualifier is based on the time of the last change to occur in the bundle, taken from git. For example, compare the following two builds:https://hudson.eclipse.org/ecf/job/ecf-tycho.master-neon/6/artifact/releng/org.eclipse.ecf.releng.repository/target/repository/plugins/And:https://hudson.eclipse.org/ecf/job/ecf-tycho.master-neon/8/artifact/releng/org.eclipse.ecf.releng.repository/target/repository/plugins/You can see that qualifiers increased for the following bundles: o.e.ecf.identity, o.e.ecf.provider and o.e.ecf.provider.remoteservice.This is because changes where committed to only those bundles, therefore increasing the """"time of the last change"""" for only those bundles. So if you make a change in git, the qualifier will always increase, even if the bundle's version did not.Does that answer your question?""",1

The last change I think was very good to ensure that we both can test, and use, the setup file outside the custom catalog. Keep in mind also that the setup file will be a """"blue-print""""/example for tool-smiths that creates their own setup files, so having all that is needed in the setup file itself, I think is a good thing (otherwise those tool-smiths will likely """"forget""""/""""miss"""" the Oomph setup feature, and then the setting of preferences will not work).Apart from the missing textual notation feature, https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=506005#c10, I realized that we miss the core C++ feature also!We need to add both:  Papyrus-RT Core C++ Feature (Incubation)	0.8.0.201610171302	org.eclipse.papyrusrt.umlrt.cpp.feature.feature.group	Eclipse Modeling Projectand   Papyrus-RT Textual UML-RT Feature (Incubation)	0.8.0.201610171308	org.eclipse.papyrusrt.xtumlrt.xtext.feature.feature.group	Eclipse Modeling Projectto align with the current tester setup.""",1

Oomph was intelligent enough to detect the two new added features and popped up a dialog asking for installation of these new features (I have never seen this dialog before in corresponding scenarios, must be some new improved behavior in Oomph). Anyway, I think that we are close of getting this one completed. The only thing left is to actually get the 0.8 repo completed, and make the final update to the setup file to reference the release repo.""",1

Even paying attention to copyright statements.This change certainly cuts neatly through a bunch of unnecessary and wonky code.  I was going to complain that changing the APIs in the UI classes from working with URIs to working with IResources results in a loss of generality, so that it would be more difficult to support exporting diagrams to the host filesystem (which is desperately needed, IMO) or other destinations, and that IResource is not even as appropriate a type as IContainer, but then I observed that the entire export infrastructure beneath the UI is all pinned to the IResource contract, anyways.  That, combined with the fact that any clients trying to use these UI bits would have had to construct nonsense URIs, means that I don't mind that this technically is an API-breaking change because that API was already non-functional and it will have to break again some time anyways to support exporting to non-workspace destinations.  Besides that none of these UI classes should ever have been exposed as API to begin with.All of which is to say thanks for working through the contribution process and do come back for more.""",0

To read the stacking pattern in the diagram? If you do as in the legacy tooling then I can't say that it will be hard to read. There is actually an aspect that you should not make the figure larger and that is the layout of legacy models. This is especially important for ports on capsule parts which should be 11x11 pixels large, disregarding if the stacking pattern is shown or not. The reason for the proposal to keep the stacking pattern on the inside is actually more about aligning with the layout of legacy models and size of ports there, see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=496304 for initial work related to this (but that one did not include the aspect of replicated ports, since we track that separately with https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=497825 and improvements in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=500982).""",1

1484,Patch Set 3: Code-Review+1I think this boils down to a granularity issue. Unless there is a way to specify optional/mandatory dependencies at a class level we have to look at the bundle as a whole. If a bundle (or parts of it) are useful without a specific dependency being present then we should not get into the way and allow consumers using a bundle.The other issue is with documentation in 3rd party libraries in general. Some do think about those use cases and document them. Some do not think about this and don't document this at all.,1

But if you take a closer look between the screen shot for case 1 and case 2, the difference is that the """"black line"""" has its ending a bit further in for case 2, i.e. the intention is to move p2 inside the package Protocols. For case 1 the intention is not to move p2 inside package Protocols but order it after, i.e. it should be a peer to the package Protocols.Anyway, since case 2 is about moving p2 inside the package Protocols, I assume that the expected result should be that p2 should be moved before p1 inside the package Protocols. As it looks now, it replaces it, at least when just looking in the model explorer with the protocol customization enabled. But the protocol message from p1Msg is now contained in p2 instead.If I disable the protocol customization, then it looks like a real mess. Not sure at all what have happened.Does this give more information about which gesture to make?""",1

I've tested it with GTK2 and GTK3 and it's the same. I don't see any abnormal indent.Concerning """"Remember selected filters"""" in filters preference page it does not seems to be the same for the two tabs. Is it normal or these two tabs should have this option? For the Groups preference page it will be possible to move this field above the tabs, but it will be more consistent if the filters and the groups have the same layout.""",2
2015,"""Patch Set 6:Hello Simon,1) For the indent, I notice (under windows) that pages 'Editor', 'Item Providers', 'Logging' and 'Post-Processors' display options that are slightly indented with regard to the page title. Other pages display fields that are perfectly aligned with the page title. i'll send you some screenshots by mail.2) For the 'remember selected x': It's normal that it's not present for each tab of the filters. So it definitely should be displayed above, with a label that explains that this preference makes it so that the editor will automatically reuse the latest group/filter list used in the latest comparison. So I think this check box should be extracted and displayed on top of the page for both groups and filters.""",1

Maybe something like """"Remember selected group"""" would be better. Secondly, this preference is independent from the selected group/filter, still it is on the same level as the Description group, which is dependent on the selection. Maybe we should put the description and the list of filters into a group?Page Groups  * Label at the top has a larger margin to the list below than on previous pages.  * Same last two as for filtersItem Providers  * To be consistent with other pages in EMF Compare (e.g. post processors), it'd be good to have a brief label at the top.

In the ticket Markus also says that there are similar issues in JDT builds. But we can add it to this commit for the platform. But it looks like in the platform this is the last remaining direct Require-Bundle entry. > Should all bundles with a Service-Component add a Require-Capability > on osgi.extender?Yes I think so. There was a contribution about this in the past, but it didn't work that time because p2 doesn't support OSGi capabilities. But we could add Require-Capability and the p2.inf files to all bundles that make use of DS.I will update the contribution on this later and see if the build and the feedback is fine then.""",2

Or do we?Hmm, that's news to me. It does make some sense to offer this generic API that works with any supported matcher scope; but I think for EMF in particular, the NavigationHelper API (or a future version of it) is more user friendly.Even if we promote the IQRC to end-users in the future, that's hardly an argument to breaking compatiblity now. > Can we provide a default implementation for this feature based on > current functionality? I am not sure what to say. The """"seed"""" parameter is already there for the enumerate/count/contains methods. The new functionality would just be that indexing services could be requested for specific bitvectors (which parts of the seed will be given?) as opposed to the entire input key. I believe the default implementation could just request that the whole key be indexed - it would be functionally correct, though it would not bring the performance benefits.> Can the existing behaviour work further with the new API (e.g. do we want to deprecate the old methods when we use this)?Yes and maybe.

3475,"""Patch Set 14:Ok, lets step back a bit here: who are the implementors and the users of the IQueryRuntimeContext API? Implementors are the Scope providers, and users backend providers? Is this correct? Rete and LS are not problematic, as they are developed in parallel with this API, so they can keep up with the API.The important question is, do we consider the chance that anyone else would implement some query backend in the future that will not be developed in VIATRA? If there won't be anyone, we should close down this API, and then the entire conversation will be moot, and we should indeed consider only the implementors of scopes.However, and I believe, this is the case, if we want to have an API for externals to provide backend implementations, the IQueryRuntimeContext API should remain compatible for both users and implementors, and appropriate steps should be taken to avoid breakage (e.g. the methods there will be in 1.4 should be stable enough). > Even if we promote the IQRC to end-users in the future, that's > hardly an argument to breaking compatiblity now.We have already broken compatibility. By adding new methods to the interface that was implemented directly by scope providers they have to be updated.

It is clear that the API should reflect the services provided by the base indexer, and the IndexingLevel enum approaches this concept from the implementation side. After reading your comments, I think it would be better to use flags on the API, and the indexing level would remain specific to the NavigationHelper. The flags could be unambiguously transformed to the base indexer levels by the IQRC implementation. For flags, using bitfields or @Data classes are either acceptable in my opinion.What do you think about this approach?""",1

3898,"""Patch Set 7: Code-Review-1(10 comments)Hello Stefan,I didn't have the time to make a full review but I can't continue right now so I publish a partial review. More to come soon (I hope!)""",2
3899,"""Patch Set 7: Code-Review-1(8 comments)Thanks for your partial review, Laurent! While doing a review on my own and incorporating your review, I found a problem that when only the UML file is changed, the approach won't work too.I re-investigated this problem and thought about it a while... the nicest way would be to avoid loosing the information on the resources in scope during the minimization; that is, minimizing the scope but storing somewhere which resources had been in scope at the beginning. Then it would be very easy to check if a .di file was in the scope.Ideally, we could change that in the ComparisonScopeBuilder. However, e.g. the EMFModelProvider calls the IdenticalResourceMinimizer before the ComparisonScopeBuilder is even used to create the scope later down the road. Thus, there is no central point that we could change in order to retain the list of original resources in the scope.(On a side note, I stumbled across a potential source if problems: SynchronizationModel.getResources() is created lazily. If getResources() is called before the minimizer is applied to the SynchronizationModel, it'll contains the original set of resources also after the minimization. If it is called afterwards, it won't contain it. Sometimes getResources() it is called before the minimization step, such as in org.eclipse.emf.compare.ide.ui.internal.logical.EMFModelProvider.getOrComputeLogicalModel(IFile, ResourceMappingContext, IProgressMonitor), sometimes it isn't. So we cannot trust that the getResources() is minimal or not. I'll add a task for myself to open a separate BR on that.)So my best remaining idea so far: remove the comparison scope adapter introduced in this review again and instead introduce a postprocessor that checks if any .di file exists for the matched resources and if yes, mark the comparison as a PapyrusComparison.For marking the comparison as a Papyrus, the nicest way would be introducing a context field into the Comparison model. If we don't want to change the comparison model, we again could add an adapter to it in order to mark it. But that's not particularly clean :)What do you think about the above mentioned postprocessor approach? It is not super-efficient, as we theoretically had the information already that we obtain again in the postprocessor. But at least we only do it once for each comparison instead of checking it again and again in the different UI components.""",1
3900,"""Patch Set 7: -Code-ReviewHello Philip, thank you for your thorough analysis.I think it'd be nice if SynchronizationModel had a method providing the URIS of all the resources that are involved in its non-minimized form.Do you think it would solve the problem?""",2

Parallel build could work like this:queue = new ArrayBlockingQueue()queue.addAll(modules)for (int i=0;i<availableProcessors;++i) {  startJob() // each job is polling queue and stops when queue is empty}waitForCompletiononOfBuildJobs // =loop on all the jobsThat would allow equal CPU utilization for all the jobs (otherwise it could be that one job is processing only small files, while another only big ones).WDYT?""",1

If something is public AND non-internal, then it becomes a OSGi API.But non-public things have never been considered API, they are completely inaccessible from things outside their own package. This is restricted at the compiler level.Our compiler settings don't enforce javadoc for default and private members, because those are necessarily invisible from outside their package.Tbh, I don't think it's a bad idea to put Javadoc on all classes, more information is always good. But we never enforced it on anything (non-public) before, so I wonder what we absolutely have to start NOW, on a patch that is already quite time-critical.

We actually wondered if out of alphabetical order was going to make the users experience off and concluded that changing the convention set up by many other applications would be far worse.3- Notice the question mark next to views? that was there in the wiki, we didn't come to a conclusion on that point. It was more of a """"We can't think of anything better, let's put this here then update it"""" item.4- The main conclusion (according to my memory) was the #2 was the proposal to take. We moved on to other topics after, we did not spend 3 hours on this one point.I think the amount of responses though is good, it shows that we all care about the users getting the best trace analysis experience possible. Tomorrow we shall discuss this and come to a reasonable understanding, I am certainAlso, memory is malleable, I think we need to take better minutes for all that is user facing.

6640,"""Patch Set 4:> Wow - this was really close. I tested this on Windows and already > typed in my +2 message. Only picking up one cup of coffee saved us > from accidentily submitting thisI still think this fix is the right thing to do, not closing resource is never a good idea but this change is defeating the RepositoryCache creator original intent, which I think was to keep stuff around as long as possible by using SoftReference.I tested this series and so far the memory consumption drastically improved because the RepositoryCache is no longer slowly growing but I can see that the disk IO increased and performance degraded in operations involving many repositories, like listing projects in Gerrit (ls-projects command).Relying on the SoftReference mechanism to evict old unused repository is not a good idea because the eviction becomes unpredictable. For example, our Gerrit master JVM heap is set to 58GB, the old generation space(Tenured Generation) is 44GB which leaves 14GB for the eden and survivor spaces. The old generation space eventually becomes full (mostly by the caches including the unbound RepositoryCache) and then the application starts slowing down because GC keeps kicking in. The SoftReference are still not being collected at that point because the buffer of available memory is not bellow the threshold that would make GC consider the SoftReference.All this to say that I will do more testing on our production server but if it turns out that the performance impact is too big, I(we) will need to consider reimplementing the RepositoryCache to achieve the goal of keeping repository in memory but without being forever (I am not sure yet what would be the eviction criteria).""",1

There are some bundles in neon which can't be unpacked by Java 7's unpack200 since they have been packed using Java 8 and Java 7 is unable to unpack them and p2 is too dumb to use the corresponding jar as a fallback :-(I switched back the egit.gerrit job to use Java 7 and retriggered the buildI am now first trying to find the cause for the problems I currently face with running egit core tests from maven (also using mars target platform).

The only affected people would be those who already have this set in the dialog settings, that would see there setting reversed after an update.

The difference is what the default is if the string is missing in the configuration. If there is no configuration then the settings.getBoolean() will return false (IIRC) which means that you can't tell the difference between someone who hasn't set this value and someone who has explicitly disabled the setting. In fact I think this will have the opposite behaviour in that skipGeneration will now explicitly be false and thus always generate it in the case of a missing value. At least that is the case if getBoolean returns a boolean (as opposed to a Boolean). That said if you've tested it and done all the cases (running with a clean workbench without Oomph modifying the setting behind your back, checking the default works of not set, it persists once you have set it etc.) then I'm happy to withdraw my -1""",2

And we need to test building with the coming milestones dependencies before it's actually released. - (minor) Using the simrel repos slow down download (index) and dependency resolution (in the case of CDT, it slows down *a lot*)So what I can do for now is have the 4.6 and staging target be the same and once Neon is out, they will start to differ.

There is some public API that is not strictly CDI that is left unreferenced by this and it points to the need to refactor launch component.The entire hierarchy of org.eclipse.cdt.launch.ui.CMainTab should be removed (this is distince from DSF's CMainTab)Some of the classes in the hierarchy of CMainTab are unused/unreferenced in CDT, however RemoteCMainTab is still used: It is still the case that for remote launch the Main Tab is different when doing Run and Debug.

The problem is that tab and org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote.tabs.RemoteCDSFMainTab do the same thing, but the latter for debug and the former for run. With the two different tabs for Main we end up in this situation that if you open Debug or Run launch ui, you end up with different UI on screen. I can better explain (with a screenshot if needed) when I get back to my desk.BTW if we don't deprecate RemoteCMainTab, we should not deprecate org.eclipse.cdt.launch.ui.CMainTab either. Final note, what I meant by:>  I don't think I will have time before M6/API freeze to rework this properly.is that I won't have time to refactor/review the code to be able to simply remove CMainTab and all children (including RemoteCMainTab) as that removal needs further updating the plugin.xml. So I do appreciate you deprecating the classes for now.As a final note, I know of at least a few extenders of CMainTab outside of CDT, including TCF, Renesas e2studio and another one.""",2

Right now, the existing -2, although it's stale after you adjusted the patch, does not harm anyone, especially that the patch cannot be merged due to the test week. It does not mean -2 is still valid, but that this is the last valid review for which I had time.

7573,"""Patch Set 7:> """"allowNulls"""", the design of the state system is that there should be no null values when returning from a query. It's not explicitely enforced in the backends' runtime code, but it could be. Testing this means testing cases that are not supposed to happen.When used along with a StateSystem, the query does not return null because the StateSystem first fills the interval list with a subset of the intervals and the backend fills it with the remaining subset, and both subsets complete each other and are mutually exclusive. So it is perfectly valid and expected in our runtime implementation that a backend does not fill some of the elements in the interval list. I could easily foresee test cases asserting that some elements must be null in the result of a query. These assertions could be checked after executing testDoQuery() which should therefore complete without failing.> The two """"abstract"""" methods (getBackendForBuilding/getBackendForQuerying). The concept of """"reopening"""" only applies to the HistoryTreeBackend, this notion should remain in that test class, not in the -Base. Parameters and the """"reopen"""" constructor parameter is a nice way to offer both alternatives.Any backend could support reopening and then should override getBackendForQuerying(). Those backends that don't support it don't have to do anything. I think this is perfectly fine. My solution has the advantage to reduce code duplication. In the context of unit test code, I believe this is more important than conceptual considerations.> The abstract method I'm suggesting tells the implementation to """"create a backend and insert these intervals"""". This is a clear initialization step.This clear initialization method is implemented in a final protected method that performs these steps in the base class in my patch.

It should be kept as consistent as possible.I hope you are not suggesting that forcing all subclasses to implement a method that can more easily be provided by the base class is preferable for reasons of consistency.I therefore respectfully disagree with your remaining objections.

We could move the tests in that class into the new base class to have them run on other backends.I'd also prefer to stick it to one abstract class that sets the backend.

This fixes my most serious concern in regard to honoring the IProgressConstants2.SHOW_IN_TASKBAR_ICON_PROPERTY flag.(b) I can confirm that the system task bar is *not* yet triggered during the RCP startup process, there exists two reasons for this:(b.1) Previous 3.x Workbench code did enter in WorkbenchAdvisor.openWindows() a different code branch, because the lineIStatus status = myConfigurer[0].restoreState();could give a not-OK-status, this is no longer possible, because now WorkbenchConfigurer.restoreState() *always* returns OK_STATUS.(b.2) Now Workbench.createAndRunWorkbench does not wrap the splash handlers progress monitor using TaskBarDelegatingProgressMonitor.(b.3) My test program omits to set SHOW_PROGRESS_ON_STARTUP=true in the plugin_customization.iniTherefore my action items for this week end are:- Upload an improved test program that ensures that the startup presents progress on startup- Try to fix the second unwrapped progress monitorMy most serious concerns for this issue are fixing to honor IProgressConstants2.SHOW_IN_TASKBAR_ICON_PROPERTY.

The proposed fix has 3 instances of the image shown and breaks up the tags into repos.  There should be only 1 image with a specified id.  That is the unique identifier and should be kept as such.  I do not agree with breaking it up into repos and then showing tags in a single line as numerous tags fills up the line quickly and the user won't be able to see them unless they use the Properties View.  In addition, the user is used to referring to the image with the full repo/tag name so we should show it as such.""",1

As a user, I would search by repo/name instead of id. Also, splitting the 'Repo Tags' column in 2 would be better, IMO.Can you explain how you would intend to show all repo/tags on a single table row ? The current code fails at showing all those values.

If I have an image with 6 tags for the fedora repo let's say I see this in a single fat row where the repo tags column has 6 entries on top of each other.

Yuck.Not sure what's the best way to deal with this, especially since doing """"ln -s ├ñ├®├╝.txt link.txt"""" on the command line produces a link with on-disk size of 10 bytes, so it evidently is in NFC, not NFD.""",1

These now seem to work as well with canonical synchronization as they did in MarsSo, the overall design of this canonical edit-policy refactoring isn't changed:  it's just the core API signatures that are tweaked.

Then why was camel case also not set as suffix proposal?In a similar way, there could be some other existing type of proposal or one that could be implemented later, which may need to be handled similar to camelCaseMatch while validation.Hence, as I had suggested during code walk-through, I feel it would be better if you have the property as substringProposal instead of suffixProposal, which would be specific to your feature and will be set only for substring proposals.

Before that, please have a look at the following as well:- It is not working for type names, e.g. when you type a substring of a class name to declare a field.- The relevance / proposal order is mixed up when fields are proposed with types. Example:public class C {	int intField;	String stringField;	{		field|	}}- In case of methods, the substring is also matched in its parameters, return type, declaring type etc. I think it should be restricted to only the method name.- Filtering of the results still seems to have some issue. Not sure if the filtered results look confusing or non-relevant due to the above issue of not restricting the match to just the name or if it is due to the non-subsequent matching. We can check that once the above issue is fixed. Also, pattern highlighting in the proposal will be very useful with this feature. Please check if it is simple to implement. Otherwise, we can do that later.""",1

I suppose, the names were chosen before support for camel case matching was added. For now, I have updated Javadoc to reflect how validation is done but have not touched the method names since that change would affect subclasses as well. However, I consider that renaming these methods to isValidToken() and isMatching() is something similar would make their roles more clear to future contributors.""",0
10398,"""Patch Set 12:(1 comment)Thanks, Gabor. The code changes look good now.About using """"token"""" instead of """"prefix"""" in method names and Javadocs, you are right. But let us keep the method names and Javadocs same as before as of now i.e. you can revert the Javadoc changes. We can modify that together with method names if we plan to do so. In one way, """"prefix"""" can in general refer to the token used for invocation of content assist, though invocationToken is more appropriate. We can deal with it later.""",2

Would have been bad if we forgot and left it in the feature and everyone installing the Qt plug-ins would get the ANTLR plug-in even though it's not used.But, yes, I'd rather see the category.xml/Tycho mirroring done for the CDT repo for these early days.

Most of the time it was actually so quick that it should not even have time to select a different event. I changed testGoToTimeGoBackAndForthAndCheckStack to make sure that it waits for the expected event to be selected and also so that it checks the call stack at every step (prev/next event). There is no API to access the current selected event in the Call Stack view so I thought the next best thing was to inspect the selected event in the table.After those changes, the test is not flaky anymore on my machine (100 times).""",1

It's the branch that always points to the latest release. The Git master branch does not have this semantic.Also my guess is that in most cases, when users want to convert their repository to Gitflow, it would make more sense to turn the existing master into develop (e.g. the EGit repository).""",2

When I look at https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-clone.html#URLS I don't see it explicitly mentioned. All examples have a path. And I guess some functionality needs a path.

Guava ArrayBackedList(?) was proposed.

SortedSet/NavigableSet is for things like TreeSet, where the elements are sorted as they are inserted. These will also be equal no matter their insertion order, more intuitively.We must use the special 'Set' code for HashSet and LinkedHashSet.

13853,Patch Set 6:Maybe I don't understand something but it does not make senseto call this method more then once per test.

13854,"""Patch Set 6:In the step into selection tests, the test has a .cpp and a .h.

Shall I do this change, or you do it?-code formatting: I don't really remember how, but years ago we ended up with our own way of formatting the code.

14356,"""Patch Set 3:I think the only other concern I has was exception handling. There are quite a few places where SnapshotException is caught, and it is either wrapped in a RuntimeException or reported as an error.In some cases we have to do one of those since the catching method cannot throw a checked exception, but we should make sure that the choice of throwing SnapshotException, wrapping in RuntimeException, or reporting the error is correct.In general, is the approach that """"user facing"""" things like queries should report errors, but that """"code facing"""" things like the collection extraction API should throw exceptions?There are some places where the existing query code catches SnapshotException and reports an error, but since the logic is now pushed inside the collection extraction API it throws a runtime exception and the query no longer catches it (e.g. CollectionFillRatioQuery). This means that previously there would be an error reported to the user but it would now lead to an uncaught RuntimeException.If we wanted to not wrap in RuntimeException, basically every method that does not implement an existing API would need to throw SnapshotException since implementing code may want to call another method that does. Even then, the code implementing an existing API like Iterator would still have to wrap SnapshotException in RuntimeException.""",1
14357,"""Patch Set 3: Code-Review+1Unless we wanted to alter the exception handling (I'd originally thought """"I'll fix that later""""), I'm fine to have it committed - we can fix any bugs as they arise.I think it would still be a good idea to allow other plugins to add supported collections (via an extension point), but since I've lost my code to do that I'll have to re-write it. That won't break any API just add some more, so that is fine to do later for next year's releases.""",1

That would make it easy to add corresponding tests, and would keep the review quite small.  Subsequent reviews could introduce one or two additional blocks at a time, making each review self-contained with the corresponding test coverage.If that means that we end up with a review that's over 1000 lines we'll file a CQ (a CQ is really not a big problem).""",1

The method name is isEditable(etc), and it is now returning 'true' when in fact it cannot be edited. Not only does it not make sense on the code level, I will also have several launch descriptors where even the idea that it could be edited will be confusing to a user.  And finally, I think popping up dialogs for situations we already know won't work doesn't make sense. I don't like the idea of putting an error decorator on the gear. This implies the descriptor SHOULD be editable, but something is wrong, and so it cannot. This is not the case for my descriptors. There's nothing wrong with them. They simply cannot be edited.

But you are right that it could be nice for the single process case.  We could look into an enhancement to show the exited process node even after GDB dies. I suggest we do that separately.  Note that the exit code is still visible in the title of the console in that case (as long as the process exited on its own).  > * I like this additional way to restart the terminated process from > the same session :-)Me too :)  But of course, that can only work if GDB is kept alive. > * Using the setting to """"Automatically debug forked process"""" and > getting a small program which sequentially creates child forked > processes, don't preserve the exit code for all children but one. > This may be related to the collision of re-used group ids.Thanks for doing that test.

There is no guarantee that Jeeeyul's (anyone's) theme will be """"light"""". There will be custom dark and light themes and just resetting everytime is not a solution. So it looks quite reasonable for me to have all custom themes specify whether they are light or dark.

15354,"""Patch Set 3:Let me explain the reset functionality. Before 4.4. if you applied a theme and afterwards another theme all stuff that was not overriden in the new theme remained styled as in the first theme. That was annoying and therefore we had this """"Restart"""" warning in the Preference dialog (which you implemented).In 4.4. we introduced the """"reset to default"""" functionality. If you switch from theme A to B, everything would be set to """"default"""" and afterwards everything would be styled accordingly to B. This allows new themes to control everything without side effects from older themes. Please note that we still have a few bugs in the reset stuff, e.g., Form controls do not all support the reset functionality.So in your case, if I switch from one theme to """"Something else"""" all styling must be resetted to the default, e.g., preferences, colors, etc. As you are now argue this reset requirement away for the OS settings in this review, we also tried to argue that away for the preferences but this was strongly requested by the JDT team.""",0

Also in order to do the handling of VM args in this file, it would have required functions to be exported from eclipse.cFinally the changes to eclipse.c are necessary because the previous code that was handling the appendage of VM args was incorrect.

15741,"""Patch Set 1:Sorry, I was on easter vacation and couldn't respond early enough.Could we please revert this change?  It dramatically reduces theperformance in case of non-bare repositories. Hey Shawn, what'sup? I have not seen such a small change with such a bad performanceimpact passing your review eyes :-)Semantically I think this change is correct. We want to avoiddealing with pathes where there are no diffs. How to achieve that?You could either apply a ANY_DIFF filter to the treewalk or comparethe tree entries manually when walking over the unfiltered trees.Previously ResolveMerger was manually comparing TreeEntriesand skipped over those where there are no diffs. Now you added the ANY_DIFF filter.ANY_DIFF sounds logical but performance wise it's not soo good.Its a very generic filter which compares content-IDs of all participatingTreeIterators. It doesn't differentiate between the differentiterators and blindly computes id's for the content unless it findsdifferent ids. If the treewalk happens to have a FileSystem basedWorkingTreeIterator included this means that you will have to readnearly every single File in the working tree and compute it's content SHA1to do the merge. ANY_DIFF has no idea that there may be a DirCacheIteratoralso in the TreeWalk which already contains the SHA1 of the non-dirtyworkingtree files. ANY_DIFF will always compute the SHA1 again. Onlyexception: if ANY_DIFF detects already a difference between e.g.OURS and THEIRS then it knows early that there is a diff and canskip calculating SHA1's for filesystem content.If we manually do the detection of diffs in an unfiltered treewalkwe can be much faster. Look at ResolveMerger.processEntry() to lookat all the cheap shortcuts we can use. E.g. if the index is dirty(somebody added something for that path) we can let the merge fail becauseof that.If OURS, THEIRS, BASE don't contain anything for that path we knowit's only index and working tree which may contain something for thefile - no need to process this path during the merge.

15743,"""Patch Set 1:Having automated performance would be great ... but up to know I was not able to create stable performance tests which work on all the supported platforms. E.g. Windows & Linux differ much when it comes to filesystem performance, filesystem timers have different granularity, etc. I gave up on automating this and do it manually. I personally use the linux repo or some really huge internal repos for performance checks. And I most of the time just compare the performance to the predecessor commit.I was thinking what could be introduced in that area is that JGit publishes (e.g. as MBeans) some counters (number/size of working tree contents read, number of pathes visited in treewalks, number of pathes where content merge was triggered, number of pushes/fetches). AFAIK this doesn't cost anything if the published values are not read but would allow to do better validations if e.g. EGit is slow.""",1

15847,"""Patch Set 5: Verified+1 Code-Review-1(2 comments)Hi Mickael,I tested the latest patch. In general it works very well. The only thing that I think could be changed at this moment is described by the following scenario:Create 3 projects (p1, p2, p3) and 2 working sets (w1 and w2). Then assign p1 and p2 to w1; p2 and p3 to w2.Next, try to DnD p1 and p2 (together) from w1 to w2. The result is that p1 is moved to w2, but p2 is not removed from w1.In Package Explorer this operation is not allowed (i.e. moving a group of projects which contain some projects that are already in the target working set).I think that for now we should keep the same behavior in both explorers.I also took a quick look at the code. In addition to inline comments:1. Could you change the commit message to the most prevalent format?

15940,"""Patch Set 1:The reason why the read-only state of resources wasn't being cached at all in the scenario of showing the context menu in the Model Explorer is because the vast majority of accesses to the read-only manager were to query the read-only state of a resource directly, not indirectly via an EObject contained in the resource.  That was the only API that was cached before:  read-only state of a model element.So, the first major change in this patch is to additionally cache the read-only state of resources in the FSReadOnlyHandler, itself.  This was easily and safely done by a minor refactoring of the AbstractReadOnlyHandler to make the cache available to subclasses.However, this was not sufficient because the cache was actually always a no-op in the context-menu scenario.  The problem here is that caching was only active during the scope of a transaction in the read-only manager's editing domain.  However, the vast majority (if not all) of the read-only queries in the context-menu scenario are done without a transaction.  And even if they were done in a transaction, each and every one probably would have had its own transaction, nullifying any cache and probably making performance a bit worse by always setting up and tearing down the cache machinery.So, the second major change in this patch is to eliminate the cache's tie to transactions.  Now, the cache is implicitly initialized when read-only state is queried and is purged in an async exec (abstracted through an injected Executor).  This fixes the read-only part of the performance problems in the context menu.A bit of work was needed to fix the read-only JUnit tests, by injecting a custom executor that the tests can use to control when the cache is purged to force re-calculation of read-only state of resources as they change state.  Note that the read-only manager's makeWritable(...) API still *synchronously* purges the cache as before, so the make-writable use cases should still work (which is born out by the tests, actually).""",1
15941,Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2Looks good; there are indeed lots of graphical stuff happening outside read-only transactions (GMF was the main user of read-only transactions I think; we barely ever used them in the Papyrus UI),2

Anyhow, I don't see how it would compile> without the package import, even using another build system...?In order to see the additional problems you should have installed an API baseline (see http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#Checking_for_JGit_API_Changes_using_API_Baseline).Maybe you have silenced API tooling in your eclipse.It does compile with maven even without your fix. Otherwise our automated builds would have detected this bug before.I guess the reason is that the pom.xml already contains the needed dependency. Yes, it's a shame that we have two parallel ways how we define dependencies. See Matthias commit c18694e0 where he added slf4j and had to do that in pom.xml and MANIFEST.MF in parallel.Try this out:    > git checkout d1bda470d4      # That's the commit before your fix  HEAD is now at d1bda47...

16460,"""Patch Set 1:Hi Christian, the idea from this constraint came during the discussion of the """"no containment cycles"""" constraint. We had an example where a rule contains a containment cycle that is build from container edges (opposed to containment edges).During discussion of this example, the idea came that this specification style should actually be considered a smell, anyways, because container edges do not have a special syntax in the graphical editor, which hides the far-reaching semantics of this type of edge. For instance, if a container edge is created in a rule, the source node will be removed from its place in the containment hierarchy and be added somewhere else. Such an important change should be emphasized in the graphical editor, which is the case if the EOposite containment edge is specified instead.""",1

I uploaded a small example at http://www.mathematik.uni-marburg.de/~strueber/henshin_container_example.pngIn the meta-model underlying this example, """"club"""" and """"player"""" are EOpposite containment/container references. Consequently, both rules in this example have the same effect, which includes the removing and adding of the Player at a different place in the containment hierarchy (potentially a different model instance). However, B does not indicate this effect in the graphical syntax, which makes it difficult for the developer to understand the meaning of this rule.In a small example, the maintainability drawback might not be too drastic. But imagine that the meta-model might be complex and, worse, evolving over time. In an earlier version of the meta-model, Players might have been contained somewhere else, so that Version B actually meant something different at that time. In this case, the warning should definitively make sense.""",0
16464,Patch Set 1:In my opinion there is no need for a warning if the user chooses the inverse edge. I would find it more useful to create warnings in situations were side effects could occur.,1

16466,"""Patch Set 1:@Matthias: While I don't see why the situation is the same as in to-1 links (generally, setting a to-1 link does not affect the containment hierarchy), your proposal of denoting container edges makes sense and would resolve this issue just as well.@Christian: I think the outlined scenario (setting a container reference) is a very strong example for these kind of situations, as it _always_ has a side effect: the reorganisation of the containment hierarchy.""",1
16467,Patch Set 1:Setting a non-containment 0..1 reference can delete an existing edge and therefore have a side effect. We should try to detect all these side effects. For this particular problem we could change the edge create command such that it always creates the containment edge (and not the container edge). Would that be okay?,1
16468,"""Patch Set 1:@Daniel: as Christian mentioned, this is a side effect.@Christian: This would help only if the container edge is not opposite of a containment edge? Because if it is, this is handled automatically or not?To summarize my view and try to steer the discussion to a decision, i would probably accept the validation check as a warning as i see the problem.""",1

16964,Patch Set 1:I did not get the chance to look on surrounding code. Whatare the implications for other getValue() users of this class?,1
16965,"""Patch Set 1:None as far as I can see. The class (PathEnvironmentVariable) is private and only used to contribute to the PATH environment variable when cross-compiling. The contribution is the path to the cross compiler you specify in your project settings. Normally that path is prepended. It normally works fine, unless you use say ${ARM_TOOL_PATH} which java.io.File does not understand. It assumes ${ARM_TOOL_PATH} is some form of weird folder name in cwd and hence prepends c:\program files\...\eclipse\bin resulting in a non-existing directory being added to the path. I can't image you'd want to use a relative path to your compiler. If relative, relative to what? Here's a few examples:Cross path: C:\myarmcompilerBefore: C:\myarmcompilerAfter: C:\myarmcompilerCross path: myarmcompilerBefore: C:\program files\Eclipse\myarmcompilerAfter: C:\myarmcompilerCross path: ${ARM_TOOL_PATH} (and ARM_TOOL_PATH=c:\mycompiler)Before: C:\program files\Eclipse\c:\mycompilerAfter: c:\mycompilerIf some user really depends on specifying the cross compiler relative to the eclipse bin dir, I suggest they use ${ECLIPSE_HOME}\myarmcompiler which is also a lot more explicit.""",1

If we don't want trace parsers that depend on native libraries in Trace Compass that's fine but we don't have to prevent people from doing it as an extension. Also, I don't think the fact that one would want to extend or replace the events table or the default editor is intrinsically related to the fact that one uses a native parser. In any case, the discussion of whether or not the extensions are useful and if they should be deprecated is out of the scope of this patch and would be best left out IMO.""",1

However, I would prefer if the default was ZERO instead of BIG_BANG, because the latter creates a odd value when represented as a string.Alternatively, perhaps even better, we could create a NULL constant that overloads toString() to return an empty string (and can't be normalized/offset?).Maybe we should revive Matthew's patch that creates special classes for these timestamp constants. https://git.eclipse.org/r/24880""",1

It can be done either with try/catch around related code oder with checks before if the related JDT bundle is available in the current system.Small small issues with the patch: - formatting is inconsistent (check especially the spaces around """"if"""" conditions) - most external class names are written full qualified in the code which avoids imports and made the code not that readable - commit message format: we use """"Bug: number"""" style.""",1

17379,"""Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1Is *this* patch *really* """"blocking other patches and multiple bug fixes""""? Or is it just due to some strange refusal of merging anything in this branch without it?For instance, the *8* patches before this one were reviewed and approved previously, why were they not merged already?The Filter View was broken since before the event-aspect change. I don't understand how it HAS to completely take over the ITmfEventFieldAspect to work again. Can't it keep using the ITmfEventField API if it likes it so much?If it wants to use the aspect API, then it should fold to its known guidelines, or """"by-design limitations to keep complexity in check"""". Not the other way around. As in, no sub-fields, no ITmfEventField.ROOT_FIELD craziness, and other things that make a simple Object getter much more complicated than it should be.""",1
17380,"""Patch Set 3:We get that you're not a fan of ITmfEventField, but it's there. CTF uses it, PCAP uses it, the Properties view for events uses it. It can't be removed without providing an alternative way to generically support an hierarchy of fields and sub-fields.This patch allows any aspect to support an hierarchy. But considering only the existing case of the event contents, the patch allows the field filter to be specified directly on the visible 'Contents' aspect instead of exposing a generic 'Event field' aspect to the user, who doesn't have to guess that the field applies to and only to the internal event content. It is an improvement for the user experience.As for migrating the filter viewer to event aspects, that is a huge improvement as it removes the old ugly solution that used special field id strings for base event members, and required a trace event type to provide its possible fields in a dummy root event field given by the empty event type constructor. It also allows for filters on any event member that is neither a base event member or a sub-field of the event content member. Keeping the filter viewer based on event fields is not a sound alternative.I think the solution is neither crazy nor overly complex. I find it quite elegant actually. You want an event field aspect based on any ITmfEventField, you provide a way to access that ITmfEventField, and an optional field or sub-field string.""",1
17381,"""Patch Set 3:> We get that you're not a fan of ITmfEventField, but it's there.> CTF uses it, PCAP uses it, the Properties view for events uses it.Yet, none of these required adding a bunch of unintuitive and seemingly-redundant methods to TmfEventFieldAspect (getField(), forField(), when we have a resolve() already; createAspect() when we have a public constructor already).I do think ITmfEventField in general is redundant with the aspect API, but you are right that right now """"it's there"""", and that it's not going away anytime soon. But that doesn't mean we have to replicate all its APIs and functionalities in the TmfEventFieldAspect class. An aspect is supposed to be a singular """"quanta"""" of information from an event. A TmfEventFieldAspect is supposed to represent a single field from a event. Not a way to access all the fields of an event, that's what ITmfEvent#getContent is for.That being said, I don't think it's helpful to keep arguing our little points here. It is merely a symptom of a bigger """"design clash"""" underneath. We should have a big discussion with everyone and decide where we want to go with the event fields, the event aspects, the filters, etc.For now, I would suggest that the rest of the branch goes in, and that a less invasive solution is investigated to retrieve event fields.""",1

Like, reading what's in the trace, and offering what can be selected. Not having to have the user read field names in another view then re-type them manually elsewhere. A prepopulated drop-down list would be much more useful than an empty text box here.Anyways, if you really feel that typing subfield names manually is such a desirable feature, I won't nak this. (One small comment though.) In a sense TmfEventFieldAspect is just a shim between the new aspect API and ITmfEventField.

17819,"""Patch Set 13:Comments for patch set 10 are mostly resolved.The synchronization is done. Cool!Since the menu action toggles the filters, and we've already synchronized the content provider, we should really just invoke the same code when toggling the content provider. This would fix Case 3 and give a good user experience.Some other issues I found during testing:- The selection gets lost when switching Projects Presentation. This is bad UI behavior and switching Top Level elements also preserves the selection.- The menu items swap:	- first time the new menu item is second	- exit and restart: the new menu item is at the top	You need to specify the order/position relative to the existing item (Top Level Elements) - afaik this is possible- Empty folders get the + (or >) sign, but clicking does nothing. Switching back to flat presentation fixes the problem. Looks like an issue with #hasChildren()""",2
17820,"""Patch Set 10: Verified-1- When you add a new package, you also have to add it to the manifest. I would name the package """"nested"""" not """"nesting"""", since you use the term """"nested"""" at all other places.- The content provider name should be 'Nested Projects' (uppercase 'p')- I think you can set the radio state by using HandlerUtil.updateRadioState(event.getCommand(), VALUE); I think there is no API to listen to content provider enablement/disablement in the Customize dialog, but you can update the radio state when the content provider is created, and when it is disposed. Enabling/disabling the content provider when the menu state changes is a little bit more tricky. You'd probably have to use code similar to what's in org.eclipse.ui.internal.navigator.filters.CommonFilterSelectionDialog.okPressed().- I take the filtering change back - let's leave it unconnected. When we disable the Java content, we also keep the Java related filters (not optimal, but that's how it currently is).- Project Presentation: it should be in the same group as Package Presentation - we can leave this as is since we don't want to introduce a dependency on JDT.- dialog store vs. preference: if you want to set it via plugin_customization.ini, then I'm OK to use a preference - but not show it in the preferences dialog.""",1

Only when toggling via menu or by the user, it should get (de-) selected accordingly.* The toggle action should also toggle the content provider, otherwise there will be strange things in the UI when the user (accidentally) disables the content provider.I would hard-wire the action and the content provider, i.e. if the user disables the content provider I would toggle the action to 'Flat'.** -> I like those 3 proposals. However, I don't know I could implement a good RadioState based on content provider activation. Do you have an example of how to do this? Or will I have to use programatic menu contributions to deal with selection? * Same applies to the filters. Here I'd even vote to not surface them in the UI, and do the filtering directly in the content provider. Otherwise, you also have to enable/disable them when toggling the menu.** -> What do you mean by """"filtering directly in the content provider"""". I don't think CNF content provider provide a good way to do that. Do you have an example? * The content provider does not react to changes: 'Import as Project' does not let the new project appear, and deleting a nested project does not bring it back as folder. I have to press 'F5' to get the view refreshed.** -> That's indeed an issue. This feature should place a few more workspace/resource listeners to trigger refresh on project creation/deletion. There are already some for some cases, I'll have a look at the reported scenario. * The state of nesting should be stored as dialog setting and not as preference. Maybe this can even be computed by the enabled state of the content provider.** -> ok for persisting it as dialog settings. However, I'd like to keep the preference as a default activation of nested view of projects, so RCP apps could enable this by default from the plugin_customization.ini.

18047,"""Patch Set 1:It looks like you're instantiating a second part service (workbench) at the window level to manage all of the listeners, and they're both backed by the same Eclipse4 Selection service.  Is that the gist of it?""",1
18048,Patch Set 1:Indeed. Please take a look at my comments in bugzilla to see what kind of problems I found. In general this is because the selection service model in 4x does not suite exactly the model present in 3x.,1

MPC currently has a BREE of J2SE-1.5, but we should update that to JavaSE-1.6 for Mars, since we already have a lot of dependencies to bundles with BREE Java-1.6.

When I try this, the properties view doesn't work anymore for the model explorer (It shows empty tabs with a lot of exceptions).Since the Properties View is associated to an IWorkbenchPage (or Part), I'm not sure it is actually legal to ask the MultiDiagramEditor to instantiate it for the ModelExplorer (And multiple instantiation of properties view for the same Part is a little bit tricky). Especially, the properties pages instantiated by the MultiDiagramEditor via the ModelExplorer will probably not be disposed when closing the ModelExplorer view.All this seems a little bit fragile (And indeed, it crashes for me at the first try)""",0

19172,"""Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1This changeset contains changes to 3 files, 2 of them are non-functional changes unrelated to the issue at hand:- Changes in PapyrusPaletteService.java- Changes in XMLPaletteApplicator.javaWhile the changes in these two files are of interest for another reason I would recommend to submit them in another patch for the the support of i18n (or lack of in this case).Beware that FilteringPaletteProvider used to only proxy palettes providers of type DefaultPaletteProvider, and not the generic IPaletteProvider because it was not guaranteed to work on all GMF IPaletteProvider. This is important because the FilteringPaletteProvider is part of the public API (per Papyrus policy of having all publicly exposed component as part of the public API). This could induce false expectations from the user, especially if a custom user-defined provider does not support the way it is proxied.Indeed, the FilteringPaletteProvider have a peculiar way of using the proxied palette provider by resetting its contributions repeatedly (on line 260). This works for the DefaultPaletteProvider because we know the inner workings of this class, but this is not guaranteed to work on all IPaletteProvider. Note that relying on the knowledge of the inner workings of DefaultPaletteProvider is not a nice pattern ...Other mprovement track: Now that WalkerPaletteContributionHelper (in FilteringPaletteProvider.java) has non-static methods and uses instance fields, we could optimize its member (private) methods so that they do not instantiate a bunch of lists for nothing but all contribute to the same. We can do that by passing the resulting list as a parameter, or as an instance field.Side note regarding style: there are some trailing whitespaces in the contributed changes in FilteringPaletteProvider.java""",1

(continuously vs standalone commit)About FilteringPaletteProvider, it should work on any IPaletteprovider. For example it should also work recursively and on ExtendedpluginPaletteProvider (new recommended way of palette customization)=> Is there any know use case where this doesn't work ?

19237,"""Patch Set 2:(5 comments)Undo/redo works well.  Thanks!  It looks odd, though, that undo/redo changes the selection in the Model Explorer even when focus is currently in a diagram editor.  Especially if I have """"link with editor"""" turned on in the explorer because in that case, the linking of the selection doesn't actually happen (which is a good thing, but looks like a bug).  I would expect the changed selection on undo/redo to be reflected in the diagram, but it isn't.  It's only selection changes caused by mouse or keyboard in the explorer view that are propagated to the diagram.Anyways, that can all be avoided simply by having the RevealResultCommand do its thing only if its view part is currently active.  That's actually better than what I suggested last time (I suggested then that the command should operate on whatever is the current view, but that would be bad, because that view may provide IRevealSemanticElement but not be the explorer, which would be confusing at best).""",1

19239,"""Patch Set 1: Verified-1 Code-Review-1Redoing a new element creation that was undone does not select-reveal the (re)created element.I understand that we can't just do as an EMF-generated editor does and attach a command-stack listener that selects the affected objects of whatever was the last command executed/undone/redone, because it could have been a command in the diagram or other context that should not alter the Model Explorer selection.   So, the idea of the command wrapper is neat.However, the command-wrapper would be more reusable/safe if it didn't explicitly look for the Model Explorer view (maybe there are multiple instances of it!) but instead checked that the currently active view provides the IRevealSemanticElement protocol.  Also, it should account for selecting the object(s) affected by undo and redo.  In the case of redo, that's the same as execute, but in the case of undo, the affected object should be the one that the new object had been created in.Also, why select-reveal only the first result?  If multiple objects were created, I would expect all of them to be selected.  At least, this is how EMF-generated editors work.""",1

But on further reflection, I think that would also be confusing, and seeing the impact of undo/redo on the model is useful whatever the context.""",1

19657,Patch Set 13:Couldn't we simply inject all required dependencies? I would stay way from complicated mocks but rather try changing the design of the settings page / wizard slightly to make them testable.,1
19658,Patch Set 13:We have more then 30 cases where we use TasksUiPlugin.getConnectorUi() and assume that the TasksUiPlugin is set up correctly. Here we use EditRepositoryWizard.addPages so why not do the setup like TasksUiPlugin.getDefault().addRepositoryConnectorUi(new BugzillaRestRepositoryConnectorUi());Thougths?,1
19659,Patch Set 13:I know that we have done it that way in the past but that's not necessarily the way to move forward. There are a number of problems with using Tasks UI:* Tests have to run as plug-in tests* Tests can't run in parallel since they rely on global state* Incomplete clean up can interfere with other tests,1

19677,Patch Set 20:If we can change the extension point reader to inject the core connector that seems like a good idea but I'm not sure we want to invest in creating that logic (rather than use something like guice).

20262,"""Patch Set 1:From looking into the changes in Gerrit there are two little things I would like to be modified:- there are whitespaces that should be removed. you can see them in the compare view.- you named the internal variables columnIndex and rowIndex. Although it doesn't has an impact, I would suggest to name those variables e.g. """"pos"""" or """"columnPos"""". I know we are in a IDataProvider where index == pos, but if somebody is looking into the sources it might be confusing using position and index in one method without transition.As said before, this is more about code cosmetic rather than functionality. From the functionality point it looks good. I will test that against several projects to verify that everything works well.BTW, are you able to create some test cases if there aren't any already? Or, if there are any, add some for your use case of huge dataset spanning?""",1

You have created a new patch, which is not that good.2. You created a new example, which is also good. :) But I asked for tests. We have several JUnit test cases in the org.eclipse.nebula.widgets.nattable.core.test project. Adding the test cases will help us to verify that everything is working as expected and if anybody changes code later, it still works.3. I can see the whitespace issues in the Gerrit web view. Just open your changes there and you will see them marked red.I haven't pushed the modified code as I'm waiting for your modifications. :) And Gerrit will nofify you when I've done it.Greez,DirkP.S.

20513,"""Patch Set 8: Code-Review-1(3 comments)Hi Stefan. I had to rebase the change and resolve some conflicts. Not sure whether I broke some things, but there's at least one *bug*: If I create a new snippet (Either through the """"Create Snippet"""" context menu or through """"Add"""" in the Snippets view) the snippet doesn't start out as needing to be saved (the little * symbol).Aside from that, I still have the feeling that we use two framework (FormEditor and data-bindings) to do the same thing. I am afraid they may get in each other's way, so I would prefer to just use FormEditors like they are supposed to. Thoughts?""",1
20514,"""Patch Set 8:(3 comments)> If I create a new snippet (Either through the """"Create Snippet"""" context menu or through """"Add"""" in the Snippets view) the snippet doesn't start out as needing to be saved (the little * symbol).Hi Andreas,I am not sure if this is a bug. I think this is the normal behavior of an editor. For example, if you create a new Java class in your IDE, the java editor won't pop-up and expect you to save the class before making any modifications to it.I think the snippet editor should not do this either.And you are right, the data-binding framework and the form editor framework are both tracking changes in the view/model. If we use only the form editor framework, we'll have to update the model by hand. (See the in-line comments)Also, I just realized that I might have made a mistake when using the data binding framework. This will update the model whenever changes occur in the editor, but we need to update it only when the save action takes place (i.e. in the commit method of the form parts). Although this is not visible as it only updates the in-memory model, not the actual json file, I think we still should avoid it. So this would be another +1 for not using the data binding framework.""",1
20515,"""Patch Set 8:Hi Stefan. I don't think the analogy with the Java editor holds up. If you create a """"New > Class"""", then as soon as the dialog is closed and before the editor opens, the file already exists on disk. This is *not* the case with snippets. If I use """"Add"""" or """"Create Snippet"""", then the editor just opened is for a snippet that does not yet exist on disk. It *only* exists in memory. In fact, the snippet editor does not even know where on disk the snippet will be saved and in what format. This is all handled by the snippet repository (in SnippetEditor.doSave):  repo.importSnippet(snippet);What importSnippet does (e.g., creating a .json file, doing a HTTP POST to a remote server, whatever) is hidden from the editor. The editor sees only the in memory snippet. See SnippetEditorInput.oldSnippet and SnippetEditorInput.snippet. The old snippet is immutable; the new snippet may overwrite this or save it under a new UUID instead.I hope this clarifies some things.""",1
20516,"""Patch Set 8:As for the databinding framework: I don't think that values should be updated only upon a save. See m2e's POM Editor for example:- Open a pom.xml- On the """"Overview"""" page change the """"Artifact Id"""" (but do *not* save).- Switch to the """"pom.xml"""" page. The XML already reflects your edit, even though the editor is marked dirty (*).I think this is *very* similar to our use case: We have two pages (Raw Source, Xtext-based Editor Source) whose contents should be kept synchronized, even if I don't do a save. Essentially, whenever a page is switched to, its contents need to be updated to what's in the in-memory model.Does this make sense?""",1
20517,"""Patch Set 8:Ok, I get it now.Should we open a bug for this or make the change in this change-set?""",1
20518,"""Patch Set 8:It does make sense.I have a question here. When you said we should not use data bindings, were you referring to the source page only, or to the metadata page as well?Because in the metadata page it will be hard to keep track of all the changes, especially for list viewers (I at least have no idea how to track changes to list items without creating an observable object).Also, I don't think the two frameworks get in each others way:When a change occurs, the data binding framework will update the in-memory model (the editor does not do this by itself) and the editor is marked dirty through the change listeners on the observable objects.When the editor is saved, the on-disk file is updated, and the pages are cleared of their dirty states.So the databinding framework does not really influence the way the editor is marked dirty or not (note that we'll still need listeners to mark the editor dirty without databinding), it only helps us keep the model in sync with the view.I might be thoroughly mistaken though. At the moment I'm trying to make things clear for myself as well.""",1
20519,Patch Set 8:Hi Stefan. Please amend this change rather than open a new one. Having to rebase two changes rather than one is just more work.Regarding the data-binding framework: You may be right; they may not get in each others way. There's one concept in the FormEditor I'd like to understand first to see how things interact: staleness. What does it mean for a form part to be stale. Can this even happen? And what is our model w.r.t. which dirtiness/staleness are evaluated? The in-memory Snippet or the on-disk snippet (which may not exist initially)? I think it's important to answer these questions first to come up with a clean solution.,1
20520,"""Patch Set 8:> Please amend this change rather than open a new one.I did not express myself properly.

20522,Patch Set 8: Code-Review-1I found a big problem to the current implementation: changes in one page are not propagated to other pages.

21114,"""Patch Set 1:There are three groups of changes in this change-set:(a) update the Properties View implementation to reuse the same SWT controls    for its tabs when the selection changes to another single or multiple    selection presenting the same Views (according to the property-sheet model).    This is a """"compatible"""" selection	(b) update the DataSource and ModelElement APIs that provide the source of    data bindings in the Properties View to allow a compatible selection to be    injected into the SWT controls already showing	(c) implementation of delegating observables that support the ModelElements'    dynamic updating of their data-binding sources	Part (a) is largely just a matter of updating the DefaultDisplayEngine to detect that the set of Views it asked to provide tab-descriptors for is the same as the set of Views for which it last provided tabs.  In this case, the existing tabs and all of their controls are re-used and the new selection is pushed into the DataSource that is currently feeding these controls.  Hopefully, the infrastructural changes in parts (b) and (c) that make this possible will allow us to further refine the re-use of controls such that any View will only be created once and can be swapped in and out of tabs using PageBooks.Part (b) updates the DataSource to support replacement of its selection.  On injection of a new selection, a notification is broadcast to announce the change and ModelElements listening to the DataSource update themselves to pick up the new selection.  This entails to fundamental changes in the way that ModelElements work:  (i) the ModelElementFactory now tells a newly created ModelElement which      factory created it, so that the ModelElement can delegate to that factory the      update for a new selection.  This is necessary because it is the factory that      knew how to unpack from the selection what the ModelElement needs when      creating the  element, so it is the best able to update the element later.  All      of the various ModelElementFactory implementations add this new capability      to update an existing element with a new selection	    (ii) when a ModelElement creates an IObservable for one of its properties, it      now wraps that observable in a new delegator pattern.  The delegator is      what ends up ultimately being bound to SWT controls.  To ensure that we      don't have to rebuild those bindings every time the selection changes      (which would entail considerable API churn to make accessible after the      fact), these observable delegators allow their delegates to be replaced at      any time (assuming that the replacement is the same kind of observable,      based on the """"compatible selection"""").  Replacing the delegate fires the      usual observable change event, which updates the UI accordingly via the      bindings.	  Part (c) is the implementation of the delegating observables.  They ensure that the entire contract of the underlying observable is provided (including all custom interfaces such as ICommitListener) via the dynamic proxy class mechanism.  The usual contract of observables is implemented, including tracking the invocation of getter methods, all verified with a fairly comprehensive suite of JUnits tests.""",1
21115,"""Patch Set 5:Patch set 5 rebases the changes onto the latest master, which was 97 commits behind.""",1
21116,"""Patch Set 3:Patch set 3 updates the DefaultDisplayEngine to re-use SWT controls on a per-tab basis, for tabs that present the same controls for the new selection as for the previous selection.  The equivalence of the contents of a tab is determined by new equals() semantics (and accompanying hash codes, of course) for XWTSectionDescriptors and XWTTabDescriptors.  Essentially, two XWTTabDescriptors are equal (and therefore would generate the same SWT controls) if their IDs are equal and their ordered lists of section descriptors are equal.With this change, the continuity of the property sheet UI is a bit better for the user:  when changing the selection, if the new selection presents the same tab with the same widgets as the currently active tab, then that tab just shows the newly selected element.  So, for example, once the user activates the Profile tab of an element to work with applied stereotypes, that tab seamlessly updates when selecting another shape in the diagram or another element in the Model Explorer (even going back-and-forth between diagram and explorer, where selections are GEF EditParts in the one case and facet tree-elements wrapping semantic model elements in the other).  There is no flashing of the UI as controls are destroyed and re-built to look as they did before.This new patch set also fixes a problem in the delegating observables, in the case that the delegate is a delegating observable implemented as a dynamic proxy (new test cases added to cover this scenario).  This problem was uncovered in testing the customization of property-sheet models (the binding of the observable list for view constraints blew up).  The """"Customization preview"""" [sic] view seems to work correctly, although I don't know what special cases there are to exercise in this view.""",1
21117,"""Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1I've been playing a little bit with the selection and tab changes, and at some point the Appearance tab became completely empty. (Apparently, this happens when switching from the Diagram's """"General"""" tab and a graphical element's """"Appearance"""" tab. And the tab remains empty until I switch e.g. from a Class to a Property, probably because they have different contents in their appearance tab)Steps:- Create a Class diagram with classes and properties- Select the diagram and go to the General tab- Select a Class and go to the Appearance tab- Switch back to the diagram: the General tab is empty- Switch back to the class: the Appearance tab is empty- Select a Property: the Appearance tab is now populated- Select the Class: the Appearance tab is now populated- Select the Diagram: the General tab is still empty- Repeat from step 3 :)Performances are otherwise really good, when switching between similar elements. Maybe this could be extended to """"Similar Sections"""" (In addition to """"Similar Tabs""""): for the Appearance tab, almost all sections are the same, and this is the most heavy properties tab. Currently, if we reuse the same sections between two selections, but add a new one (or remove it), everything is redrawn (Although 80% of the contents is the same)I also have quite a lot of exceptions when switching selection, especially in the dispose() methods, when using multiple selection (I'll attach the log file to the associated bugzilla)""",2
21118,"""Patch Set 3:Thanks, Camille.I had a brief look at one point at reuse on a section-by-section basis, but that is complicated by the need to maintain a consistent ordering of widgets in the layout.  When a section is removed, disposing its controls is easy enough, but adding widgets is more complicated.  Perhaps I'll be inspired to take another crack at it and will find some trick that makes it work.""",1
21119,"""Patch Set 4:Patch Set 4 fixes the two problems observed by Camille.  Firstly, and more simply, the problem of the General tab going blank.  The problem here was that the Tabbed Property Sheet would disposed of an entire tab and its contents if the new selection didn't need that tab at all, without any interaction with the XWT-based DisplayEngine.  So, the DefaultDisplayEngine would continue to try to show disposed controls for the General tab (or any other in the same situation).  Now the DefaultDisplayEngine listens for the disposal of the controls that it creates and cleans up its understanding of which reusable controls are still available for which sections in which tabs.The exceptions in multiple-selection scenarios all boiled down to observables being prematurely disposed, either by the composite MultipleObservableValue, or by a DelegatingObservable, or by a ModelElement.  So, now all of these various components that can aggregate/share observables participate in a simple reference-counting scheme so that observables will only be disposed (and will be disposed automatically) when they are no longer in use by any component.""",1

21162,Patch Set 3: Code-Review+1(4 comments)This looks very good even but it seems that there is still a race condition between checking for the lock and opening the secure store. I'm a bit worried that we would end up with false positives if we fail everything the lock was acquired. I'm not sure what the implications are of only checking for dead locks on the UI thread and what the chances are we would still run into the problem then.,0
21163,"""Patch Set 3:(1 comment)I don't think there is a race condition. The sequence of events that leads to a deadlock is as follows:# thread A (the CVS client) acquires the lock# thread A does a syncExec to open the master password prompt# while the prompt is open, the main thread processes another syncExec (from Mylyn) which blocks trying to acquire the lock (either directly on the main thread or by waiting for a background job)So, when getSecurePreferences is called, we are either at step 3 above (in which case we can detect that a deadlock is about to happen), or we aren't. If we aren't, then no deadlock will occur, because either:# we acquire the lock before thread A and thread A blocks until we are done, or# thread A acquires the lock first and completes its syncExec before we go any further, or# thread A acquires the lock first, we then block trying to acquire the lock, and then thread A posts its syncExec. In this case, either we are on a background thread, so thread A doesn't interact with us at all, or we are on the main thread. According to this article [1], """"if the UI thread is blocked on an ILock#acquire(), it will still execute syncExecs from other threads that own locks,"""" so there should be no deadlock in this case.

And with the current design, there can be only one writer thread (HistogramRequest) on the histogram buckets at a time.This patch only attempts to fix synchronization problems between the reader thread(s) and the writer thread.Note that a reader thread might miss an event in the middle of being counted by the writer thread, but that is OK because there should always be one last update (reader thread) after the writing is finished.""",1

22174,"""Patch Set 1:Your suggestion has two independent parts, correct? 1) I understand your first part as: Set the authenticator instead of a factory for the authenticator.  I think, this does not work because the authenticator needs to have an instance of the connection. Thus the manager needs to create one per connection. And thus needs to have a autentitcator factory instead of an authenticator.2) Remove the """"default"""" in the set method (change setDefaultAuthenticatorFactory to setAuthenticatorFactory if done without suggestion 1) and remove the open method with the extra argument. I'm happy to do this, but I don't think it really simplifies anything.""",2

22177,"""Patch Set 1:What is the problem of initializing the default in the Activator? Do you have any suggestion as an alternative? From where we should call setDefaultAuthenticatorFactory/setUserAuthenticatorFactory? The idea of having a default, was that the core can rely on there being one as long as a UI plugin has been loaded. It can not be called from getRemoteUIServices/getUIServices/RemoteUIServicesDescriptor.loadServices because those are not guaranteed to be called before the core service is used. It it can not be called from the core loadServices without introducing a core->ui dependency. One option would be to make the user UI service (i.e. sync UI service) initialize it. But that is ugly because it seems like now the user of the service has to initialize an internal detail.""",0
22178,"""Patch Set 1:I don't see that using the Activator helps, but rather obscures what is going on. You still need the UI plugin loaded, but how do you guarantee that without loading one of it's classes?

See my latest patch for the workaround. > When pressing """"Clear model cache"""" i get an unrelated message in the dialog (The search was cancelled.  Not all results may have been displayed.)The filter can still search while the index job is running.  It starts a search job.  Clearing the cache cancels that job.  The search finds all items by default without typing, so it was most likely running when you cleared the cache.  See the progress view to verify there are 2 jobs running.I like having results in the table immediately, and that is why the search starts before typing anything.  Especially when the default 'Project Only' is selected. > When pressing """"run in background"""", the list is not updated upon completion.The results will only update when the filter is changed due to lack of provider feedback.  See final comment on provider status callback. This is a very narrow scoped feature with much overhead.  I can't see initializing on startup, or even when the dialog first opens.  It should only happen on first use.  The provider chooses to to initialize, and the GUI has no idea this is even taking place.  The current filter/provider mechanism has no callbacks regarding initialization (only a clear cache method).   This leaves us with 2 choices:  Go back to the modal dialog with cancel option, or create a provider status callback mechanism.  I am leaning towards the thought that if you can't use the filter while the provider is initializing, there is no harm in the modal dialog.  The callback mechanism would allow the search to refresh and UI state to adjust however.""",1

When I remove a column, the column stays, but when I try to add it, it adds a new duplicate one.5- If I scroll down the view and then change the debug context (but stay in the same launch) the view scrolls back to the top.  I think it would be more user-friendly to not change the view at all.  Maybe it is as simple as noticing that the context change can be ignored since the ICommandControlDMContext is the same.6- I got this NPE when switching from one launch to antoher sometimes.  I might have screwed up my launch, but it shows that it could happen:java.lang.NullPointerException    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.osview.OSResourcesView.setDebugContext(OSResourcesView.java:256)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.osview.OSResourcesView.setDebugContext(OSResourcesView.java:245)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.osview.OSResourcesView.access$4(OSResourcesView.java:214)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.osview.OSResourcesView$4.debugContextChanged(OSResourcesView.java:193)    at org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.contexts.DebugWindowContextService$1.run(DebugWindowContextService.java:212)    at org.eclipse.core.runtime.SafeRunner.run(SafeRunner.java:42)    at org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.contexts.DebugWindowContextService.notify(DebugWindowContextService.java:210)    at org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.contexts.DebugWindowContextService.notify(DebugWindowContextService.java:185)    at org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.contexts.DebugWindowContextService.debugContextChanged(DebugWindowContextService.java:408)    at org.eclipse.debug.ui.contexts.AbstractDebugContextProvider$1.run(AbstractDebugContextProvider.java:79)7- In all-stop mode, I like how the menus become grayed out when the target is not available.  However, the 'fetch' link remains usable, which will trigger a """"Fething data..."""" which will only complete once the inferior is interrupted8- If there are multiple debug contexts selected,  the code choosed the first one arbitrarily.  This is not clear to the user. I suggest one of two things:  a) If all selected contexts have the same parent ICommandControlDMContext, then display resources as done now using any one context. If the parents are different, then disable and empty the view or   b) Always disable and empty the view for multi-selection9- The case where -info-os returns an error does not seem to be handled properly.  For example, if I have the OSResources view open when using a post-mortem session (core file), GDB gives:   448,664 [MI]  24-info-os   448,666 [MI]  24^error,msg=""""Can not fetch data now.""""   or   600,684 [MI]  25-info-os modules   600,686 [MI]  25^error,msg=""""Can not fetch data now.""""But the view is stuck showing """"Determining available OS resource classes..."""" or """"Fetching data..."""" depending on the timing.10- One time I got the following reply from GDB (maybe my gdbserver was wrong), but it caused an NPE that I think we should guard against:   915,516 [MI]  42-info-os semaphores   921,522 [MI]  ~""""Ignoring packet error, continuing...\n""""   921,523 [MI]  42^error,msg=""""Can not fetch data now.""""Exception in thread """"MI RX Thread"""" java.lang.NullPointerException    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.output.MIInfoOsInfo.get(MIInfoOsInfo.java:173)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.output.MIInfoOsInfo.parseResourcesInformation(MIInfoOsInfo.java:128)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.output.MIInfoOsInfo.<init>(MIInfoOsInfo.java:75)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.commands.MIInfoOs.getResult(MIInfoOs.java:47)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.commands.MIInfoOs.getResult(MIInfoOs.java:1)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.AbstractMIControl$RxThread.processMIOutput(AbstractMIControl.java:907)    at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.command.AbstractMIControl$RxThread.run(AbstractMIControl.java:754)11- The new osresources.gif icon should go under the view16 folder and should be renamed to osresources_view.gif,    i.e., dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/icons/full/view16/osresources_view.gif    Don't forget to update the plugin.xml file to match12- In MANIFEST.MF, please export the new osview package, as the other packages are exported""",1

The comments may seem larger than they really are, and I believe it won't take too much effort to get this ready to commit.- I found myself writing comments that I then realized where already part of the patch I had attached to the bugzilla entry.  Can you apply """"Patch to apply after this contribution gets accepted"""" to your contribution?  I know that I originally said I'd handle that part, but that was because we were trying to squeeze things into Juno; since we missed Juno, we should do this right, and have the final solution ready before it is committed.- Lets add two new methods to IGDBHardwareAndOS.java (with javadoc):   void getResourceTypes(IDMContext dmc, DataRequestMonitor<String[]> rm);   void getResources(IDMContext dmc, String type, DataRequestMonitor<String[]> rm);- Implement those two methods in GDBHardwareAndOS.java to fetch the list of available resources (-info os), and to get the actual resource information for a specified type (-info-os <type>).  Then you can use that service to fetch the data, instead of sending MI commands directly from the view.- The current implementation is specific to a Linux target with a pre-defined set of resource type.  It would be better to ask GDB what the resources are and base the possible table content on that (using 'info-os' without any parameters).  This would not only allow us to handle any new resources added to GDB, but also different targets (Windows, different Linux, etc)  As the names returned by GDB are not so great ('smh' for example), I think we can keep using the name mapping you define in ResourceClassContributionItem, however, if a resource is not defined in that class we would then use whatever name GDB has sent.  I think this solution will not only be future-proof, but will simplify the implementation.- Please make sure there are no warnings in the new code - Say the view is displaying a resource type, it has the view menu showing.  If I select the 'gdb' node in the debug view (or the launch node, or unselect everything), the view menu disappers.  That is ok.  However, when I select a valid node in the debug view, the menu does not appear again, until I press refresh.- I think having a column waaaaaay on the right hand-side will cause the user to not notice that column.  This happens for Kernel modules.  Can we re-order the colums to have the big column the last one on the right?  Or can we make thatbig column less wide?- Have we already discussed that when selecting a new resource type, the view would not refresh automatically if it is empty?  I don't remember why we would have chosenthat option.  It does not seem user-friendly.- We will need to disable the view when using a session where GDB is too old. By using the IGDBHardwareAndOS service, fixing this will be easy, by simply having the service return an empty list of resources for older GDBs.  This will require a GDBHardwareAndOS_7_5 version of the service to ask GDB for -info-os, while the previous version simply returns an empty list.""",1

22737,"""Patch Set 1:I have pushed a Gerrit review with further changes:https://git.eclipse.org/r/26695This integrates the SysML tests into the main """"Papyrus ALL Tests"""" suite in the place in the sequence where they were formerly, before they were split off into a separate execution.  A system property supports excluding these tests.A new """"Papyrus Core Tests (no SysML)"""" launch configuration runs this test suite as it was before, excluding the SysML tests, using that new system property.The """"Papyrus SysML Tests"""" launch configuration still launches the SysML tests only.All three of the launch configurations now configure the HotSpot JVM thus:  - max 768 MB of object heap.  This lets the tests run comfortably but    still ensures that if memory leaking regresses dramatically, we may    find out via OutOfMemoryError in test execution  - tune the garbage collector to more aggressively evict soft reference    caches than it would by default.  The Common Navigator Framework    retains everything ever shown in a tree via soft references, which    makes it difficult to see whether memory is leaking when observing    the tests under a profiler.  This also, hopefully, makes the GC    overhead a bit smoother when executing the tests with a constrained    heap limitFinally, the Ant script that runs the tests in the build is updated to remove the separate execution of the SysML tests, because these are now integrated.""",1

The root cause was that computing cross-references """"intrinsically"""" using eCrossReferences() triggered the CacheAdapter in a UML Property element, which uses the inverse cross-referencing capability to compute NamedElement::clientDependency (which used to be persistent in UML 2.4 but now isn't in UML 2.5).  This also triggered loading of objects from the CDO repository.The end result was that a Diagram in a *.notation resource, still only partially loaded from the repository (it didn't have its contained objects, yet) had the CacheAdapter attached and the CacheAdapter didn't find any contents or cross-references because the Diagram hadn't finished loading.  Later, when the Diagram's CDOLegacyAdapter got around to finishing loading, the CacheAdapter was unaware of new contained objects (Shapes in the persistedChildren containment reference) being added, because they are added without notifications (the assumption being that nothing needs to be notified because the object doesn't properly exist, yet; a reasonable assumption under normal circumstances).  Therefore, the CacheAdapter is never propagated to the rest of the contents of the diagram, so any code that needs to find diagram views of UML model elements doesn't find them, and Papyrus on CDO is basically broken.Patch Set #6 fixes this problem by reverting to the original design of the ECrossReferenceAdapter's getCrossReferences() method, which computes the cross-references """"extrinsically"""".  To fix the memory leak (this bug) I override useIsSet() in the feature-iterator to basically re-implement the special case of eCrossReferences() from ENamedElementImpl.  It's unfortunate that this hard-codes an Ecore special case, but I don't have a better fix that doesn't break some already established clients.  Note that there isn't any feasible change that I could make in CDO to help adapters like the ECrossReferenceAdapter in the object-loading procedure, and UML isn't the only model out there that uses the CacheAdapter (UML2 SDK offers CacheAdapter as a genmodel extension for any model that it generates to use).""",1
22931,"""Patch Set 6:The instanceof test is done in each call, but the boolean value can be computed once before creating the feature iterator.""",1
22932,"""Patch Set 6: -Code-ReviewIndeed, that's a good point Ed.  I'll have a look at your latest proposal from the Bugzilla patch (I'm not exactly thrilled with the special case, here, myself).""",0
22933,"""Patch Set 7: Code-Review+1This integrates the new cross-reference iterator filtering mechanism into the ECrossReferenceAdapter.  For models that already have more highly customized cross-reference list iterators that do not extend the EContentsEList::FeatureIteratorImpl (and thus do not implement the new Filterable interface), the cross-referencer provides the same external filtering as in Patch Set 5.  This does result in derived references being computed by the underlying iterator, but it should be an exceedingly rare case.The JUnit tests are significantly overhauled, using now a generated model with some hand-written instrumentation for test assertions:  * added assertions that derived features are not computed    when the cross-referencer uses the intrinsic filtering    capability of the cross-references iterator  * added assertions that derived features *are* calculated    when the model provides a non=Filterable cross-reference    iterator  * the tests still assert proper resolving/non-resolving    behaviour of the cross-referencer, but now also for    both of the Filterable and non-Filterable iterator    casesThis new patch set does not cause any problems for Papyrus's UML modelling with CDO repositories.""",1

22935,"""Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1Ugh.  Patch set #5 still has problems.  It has some kind of bad interaction with one or both of the UML metamodel and the GMF Notation model.  I have another test suite (for CDO integration in Papyrus) that has test failures with this patch, caused by two problems:  * ConcurrentModificationException when iterating the resources of a    resource-set and unloading them (the ECrossReferenceAdapter, as    extended by UML's CacheAdapter, seems to cause proxy resolution    that adds new resources to the resource-set while unloading    resources!)  * cross-references from the GMF notation views in a diagram to the    UML model elements that they visualize are not returned by the    ECrossReferenceAdapter::getNonNavigableInverseReferences()    API""",0

23131,"""Patch Set 13: Code-Review-1(1 comment)One more comment, then about the """"size"""" discussion:- There are still some size() methods with no comments whatsoever.- I don't like size(), it's easy to confuse with Collections.size(). For public methods in specific objects, you could have getPacketSize(), getResponseSize() etc. IFixedSize is unnecessary.- Having some private methods where size() actually means something different (only first packet) is crazy design. You know today, but 2 months from now nobody will remember, and we'll have lots of fun debugging size problems. Specific methods names, like sizeOfFirstPacket() etc. would be safer.- If there is no interface, then the methods can be static (if the size is constant, of course). If it's static, it should be a public static final int, not a method. Methods should be only where the size can vary from one object to another.""",0

23309,"""Patch Set 4:Thanks for giving this a look-over Daniel.  I introduced a new interface for a few reasons.First, I didn't want to filter getChildNodes() directly so as to maintain the original DOM.  The interface instead allows navigators of the DOM, such as the CSSEngine, to decide to use visibility as a shortcut.  This is useful for the CSS Spy.Second, a developer should be able to query the CSSEngine for the computed styles of an invisible widget.  I'm not sure that it's explicitly stated, but it would seem to be a reasonable expectation that if P = parent of C, then C should be a child of P.Third, I thought it might be a better pattern than cause CSSStylableElement to implement a getVisibleChildNodes(), and implement a default in ElementAdapter.  We may well have other document models that don't have a concept of visibility.I initially tried implementing this as providing an isVisible(child) method to act as a filter, but abandoned it as implementing isVisible() is particularly complicated on CTabFolder.  A CTF's children includes internal Composites and ToolBars that we can't reach programmatically, and so we can't determine their purpose.  Some of the composites exist to hold the CTabItem contents, but we can't tell which CTI.  So CTabFolderElement#getVisibleChildNodes() returns the CTabItem's control instead (perhaps it should walk and add the parents until it reaches the CTF too).  You'll also notice that getVisibleChildNodes() also returns all the CTabItem instances as they represent the tab information and they need to be exposed for tab-item properties.  Trying to shoehorn all of this into isVisible() was painful.""",1

A functional testing, we need to stress each part of the code. I haven`t found in Mylyn package where you run any functional testing. Then I would be easy to add another functional test to it. So to test the Starred flag by sending a request to set it, then another request to read the value, we would test many functions of the Mylyn review which could not be mocked. Also, we would need to set the same environment on every Gerrit server we would like to test.""",1

That way we aren't dependant on the test environment.If we have a test like the above for each action that the connector can take with a review (star, unstar, submit, post a comment, etc.), then we will have good test coverage and will be able to prevent regressions and be confident that each of those actions are working correctly.""",1

23560,"""Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1(15 comments)Its been years since I last read this code, but I agree with the basic concept of this CL. The old code was flat out wrong to skip commits already marked SEEN. They could be reached by more than one path, and in blame model that second path is carrying lines that need to be processed.The approach here is roughly correct. If the candidate is still in the queue, merge in the regions from the 2nd (or nth) path for future processing. If it was already popped, put it back in and reprocess that part of the DAG until you find an ancestor candidate that is still sitting in the queue and can have the region(s) merged into it.I mostly had style nits, and some questions about why the time equality topo sort is necessary.""",1

It would be better if we saved git credentials per repository, i.e. as user.name and user.email, rather than saving them into the global git settings. There are two basic issues with your implementation:1. It does not prevent users from being asked over and over again about their git credentials while committing multiple changes.2. Global git settings are being forcefully overridden. The 'remember' check-box should not be active when the credentials are already entered - it that case the user should override them manually in the repository view. Another approach would be to indicate in an obvious manner, that checking the check-box overrides the repository user.name and user.email.""",1

23794,"""Patch Set 8:Spend some further thought on this:The RCP-independent implemenation should have the following properties:- thread-safe- IllegalStateExceptions when core-methods like search are called when the ISnippetRepository is not open.

Also, you never know whether another thread tries to open )- Synchronizes on this when modifying/checking for the open state- close() should block when the IRepository is currently in the process of being opened.Once we have this (and thereby a better understanding of the thread-safety issues) let's come up with requirements for the wrapper.""",1

Using ConcurrentHashMap we don't have that constraint. The implementation will not cause ConcurrentModificationExceptions during an iteration. So, I changed the patch back to use ConcurrentHashMap().

23918,"""Patch Set 1:David, considering the WikiText still works with Guava 12, do you really want to make 15 a pre-req? It's probably the safest thing to do but at the same time I wonder if it's worth it until we consume any of the new APIs (which of course is difficult to know since the build only runs against 15).""",1
23919,"""Patch Set 1:I'd like WikiText to remain current and I'd like integrators to be able to use Guava 15 in stead of 12.  In an OSGi environment it's not critical since applications could simply have both dependencies, but for simple non-OSGi Java applications with a single classpath that would be impossible.  See  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=430477 for an example of the kind of problems that can come up.I don't think that we have an easy way to support both 15 and 12, so updating this dependency makes sense to me.  What do you think?""",1
23920,"""Patch Set 1:I'm not sure I understand. This change forces Guava 15 on integrators rather than giving them more choice. My understanding is that it can be problematic to combine multiple versions of Guava in a product: bug 427862. Generally speaking, version constraints should specify the actual requirements of a bundle and not reflect product packaging concerns so I'd postpone this change until Guava 15 specific APIs are actually used.""",1
23921,"""Patch Set 1:I don't see how we can give integrators more choice here, given that Guava 12 and 15 have different major version numbers (Guava 15 cannot currently be used at all since Guava 12 is not compatible).  Based on that my understanding is that there is no choice for integrators at the moment.""",1
23922,Patch Set 1:The Guava versioning doesn't follow OSGi semantics AFAIK. While not all APIs are backwards compatible in the latest Guava I thought the ones used by Mylyn were so my assumption is that for now Mylyn is compatible with Guava 12-15. If that's not the case we should certainly up the version constraints to require Guava 15. It's the safest thing for sure since that's what we are testing against now.,1
23923,Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2 IP-Clean+1I don't see any way that we can reliably ensure compatibility with both 12.0 and 15.0 without actually building/testing with both versions.  The effort required to do that is high enough that I think we should up the version constraint to 15.0.,1
23924,Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1It makes sense to me that we keep it simple. Let's require Guava 15 across the board for Mylyn 3.12. We can always go back and consider testing against different versions if needed.,1
23925,"""Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1Steffen, do you know a better way to solve this or should we merge this?""",1
23926,Patch Set 1:I'm not sure what this change does? That repository is the default anyways and the build worked for me from master: https://hudson.eclipse.org/mylyn/job/gerrit-mylyn-incubator/38/ .,1
23927,Patch Set 2:Maybe whatever the problem was it has fixed itself? It failed twice from master a couple of weeks ago: https://hudson.eclipse.org/mylyn/job/gerrit-mylyn-incubator/34/console,1
23928,Patch Set 2:My guess is that Tycho resolves a different version of Mylyn for whatever reason in that workspace. Setting proper version constraints should force the latest (rather than the Helios version). Moving to explicit targets would make resolution much more predictable so we wouldn't see this error.,1

If an ICPPASTAttributeSpecifier is encountered there, it is expected to be a C++11 attribute. The previous implementation of attributes is a bit limiting regarding the capabilities required by C++11 attributes (scope and multiple attributes in one specifier).I also thought about a solution which introduces an attribute specifier for GCC attributes, but that would break the current API.

24352,"""Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1Hi,thanks for contributing via Gerrit. I know about the contribution in the ticket itself, but I didn't had time to dig into this in more detail.Some things about your contribution:1. It seems you have the trailing whitespace issue. Looking at the ScrollBarHandlerTemplate there seem to be more changes marked as there are really. Could you please try to solve that so checking the changes is easier?2. This change may break backwards compatibility in case the ActiveCellEditorRegistry was used outside NatTable to perform modifications inside. Like exchanging the data or deleting a current selected value (e.g. https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=425176)Although the intention about the change is correct, I would like to keep the AbstractCellEditorRegistry for backwards compatibility. But it should be marked as deprecated, pointing to the new instance and telling about the issue when using it further. So users who will update won't get compile errors immediatelly.3. ScrollBarHandlerTemplateAlthough I'm not quite sure how to solve it better, I don't like the solution so far. The first thing is the instanceof check that seems to be not necessary. I thought you wanted to get rid of it?The second thing is that this change might not be compatible with the split viewport feature that was added lately. If you check the _703_HorizontalSplitViewportExample you will see that the sliders will be created by using the parent composite of the NatTable instance and are then added later on. So in case of split viewports, your change will break functionality.""",1
24353,Patch Set 1:I pushed it to gerrit for easier communication. Doing stuff through Bugzilla is just too complicated.@1: There went something wrong when merging. I will correct that.@2: AbstractCellEditorRegistry: Will try to keep the instance and update it whenever the editor gets created/disposed.@3: I would need to do an API change in order to pass in the table to the handler. If this is OK i can do it. Otherwise i do not see how this can be solved. Thanks for the review :),2
24354,"""Patch Set 1:@3 AFAIK it is internal API. So modifying ScrollBarHandlerTemplate seem to be ok.I checked where the instances are created, and they are created in ViewportLayer.doCommand() when a ClientAreaResizeCommand is handled. The ClientAreaResizeCommand needs the scrollable for size and scrollbar calculations. Typically a user should never fire that command programmatically.So you could change the API of the ScrollBarHandlerTemplate so at creation time the NatTable instance is set. You get the instance via ClientAreaResizeCommand.getScrollable().Nevertheless you should add some instanceof check, not sure on setting or on checking the editor. This is because several test cases are firing such commands with a Shell as scrollable. Those test cases shouldn't check editor states I guess, but that might be an option.Maybe you want to check if that is an option?""",1

You need to ensure that there are no trailing whitespaces. You can configure that in git config, so that is handled automatically.2. I think there are some issues in SizeConfig. On getSize() you always calculate percentage sizes. But that call should only be performed if percentage sizing is enabled. Why did you remove that check?Also you forgot to invalidate your aggregate cache when calling setSize(). Currently you are only doing this on setDefaultSize() and setPercentageSize().3. I would also like to see test cases for your changes. With changing the aggregate calculation for caching you are changing quite a basic logic. This needs to be tested well.

The classes TmfBaseColumnData, TmfBaseColumnDataProvider and ITmfColumnDataProvider could be re-used here.

BTW, I didn't write the code but the design was based on my proposal to the student who did it during his internship. Please update the code according to the comments. Also, give credit to the original author of code that was migrated.""",1

The statistics is a special use case of the tree viewer and it can be made to use these new classes. I'll leave that to someone else though, maybe as an exercice for the new students to start with TMF views?I took the column data and provider from the statistics framework. But for the abstract tree viewer and entries themselves, it is inspired from pretty much all other TMF views (time graph, xy charts, statistics)""",1

What's in the current commit and what's in the commit I want to checkout. During checkout there are two more states which could differ from these two states. The index and the working tree. So we need (maybe in subsequent changes) tests where the working tree is dirty (differs from index) and where we have staged but uncommitted changes.,2

By merging keybindings from current states of BindingManager and model we get complete set of key bindings.I attach an alternative change (result is the same as previously).

But if that issue will be solved, probably bug #314815 will be solved too. My solution is a way simpler that what is proposed in #415230. To fix this buggy effect: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=187549 it's enough to hide a label if it's empty. That's it.My solution is just hides the label if it's text is not specified, pretty the same way as it's already done with images.""",1

BooleanAttributeEditor will always have a set value because it's getValue() method returns a boolean.

But as LocaleChangeServiceImpl.updateLocalization() is protected, people could extend it for their own implementation. We could also think of making this method a static helper method, so people are able to simply use it for their use cases.If people are forced to implement their own stuff in such special cases (which is really fine for me), than we should at least provide as much help as possible and not leave them in copying framework code.""",1

25332,Patch Set 1:I'm fine with either ELocaleSwitchService or ILocalSwitchService.Then you should decide whether or not you'll offer:changeLocale(*) and changeApplicationLocale(*) and use the mediator service pattern (you get one service per context and it interacts with its context) or if you provide only one app level service and just provide changeApplicationLocale(*) for now.

However, the HT_IO is also something specific to the HistoryTree. At first this class was introduced solely to reduce the amount of LOCs in HistoryTree. So I don't think it's *that* bad if HT_IO knows how the HistoryTree works a bit.Or we could also scrap it and put all the functionality in HistoryTree, if that makes it cleaner.About the readNodeFromMemory/readNodeFromDisk, the issue is not just the overhead, it's actual functionality that might break if we don't have a """"readNodeFromMemory"""": if a history tree is queries while it's being built, the nodes in the latest branch are not written to disk yet.

25772,"""Patch Set 2:> This is by design. Merely changing null.unboxInt() to return 0 instead of -1 will break MANY things only in the state system (like stack attributes, off the top of my head). And that's without talking about views.There's a few things broken as it is now:- You can't get a -1 Int value from the factory method but you can get one using incrementAttribute() on a -2 Int value- Calling incrementAttribute() on this -1 Int value skips 0 and goes to 1.- The State System Explorer view cannot display a factory-made -1 Int value (as it is nullValue), it shows a blank value.If there is any code that is using the unboxed value of nullValue to check for null, that is badly designed code because it cannot differentiate with a real Int of that same value, it should use isNull(). I believe it's better to bite the bullet and correct that code now. Hopefully all of it is fixed by the patch now.Mathematically, I think it makes more sense to use zero as the null value's numerical value.> This is also by design. If we start to allow unboxing from one type to another, people might stop caring about what the actual type is, and always unbox their things into longs for example, doing costly casts over and over.It's a point to consider, but I prefer to give the benefit of the doubt and the flexibility to the designers. In the code I'm doing now, I have to do floating point mathematical operations on a list of state values that can be a mix of Int, Long, Double or nullValue. Using unboxDouble() gives much cleaner code than having a if-else or switch statement on the value Type to figure out the correct unboxing method.The unit tests should be correct now. The LTTng kernel state system creates a Threads/-1 attribute because the first events arrive before the Current_thread attribute has any value set. I considered updating the expected test state system with these events using the Threads/0 attribute (due to the current thread nullValue's int value), but decided against it because it would still be incorrect to consider that these events occurred in the swapper (0) thread. So the nullValue current thread continues uses the -1 attribute for the 'unknown' thread.""",1

25827,Patch Set 1:@Olav: You may have to rebase as introduction of the SharedManualMappingsAdvisor likely caused some conflicts.,1
25828,Patch Set 1:@Olav: Just a thought: Isn't ProjectCoordinateProvider already our ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService wrapper?,1
25829,Patch Set 1:@Andreas: I thought about and would say: yes and no ;-)The ProjectCoordinateProvider uses the ProjectCordinateAdvisorService and add the cache (DependencyInfo --> Pc) functionality. Until here it sounds like a wrapper. But it also provide the mapping between workspace artifacts and DependencyInfos. The class has two responsibilities of that class and I would say that adding the configuration logic of the ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService would make it worse.Also I would like to mention an other point: At the moment as user of the API you can get injected a ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService or/and a ProjectCoordinateProvider as well. The ProjectCoordinateProvider access the ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService inclusive the cache logic. The ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService access the advisors directly. I think this looks a little bit confusing and inconsistent.I mentioned that because I thought about a solution to fix both:What do you think about create a wrapper for ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService which take care of the configuration AND the cache (DependencyInfo --> Pc) logic?The ProjectCoordinateProvider will still have the other cache and would use the wrapped ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService.I think we would get a better separation and could get rid of the inconsistens by using ProjectCoordinateAdvisorService without cache and ProjectCoordinateProvider with cache both.,1

Please let me know what you think about it.Currently, there is no means to trigger the export command handler. I would suggest to add this to the TmfEventsTable Pop-up menu.Here how you could call the command handler in the method createPopupMenu() of the TmfEventsTable programmatically:final IAction exportToTextAction = new Action(""""ExportToText"""") {            @Override            public void run() {                IWorkbenchPage activePage = PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getActiveWorkbenchWindow().getActivePage();                IHandlerService handlerService = (IHandlerService) activePage.getActiveEditor().getSite().getService(IHandlerService.class);handlerService.executeCommand(""""org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.exportToText"""", null);            }        };tablePopupMenu.add(exportToTextAction);-------I also would like to ask you to change the format of the text file to match the columns in the table and instead of a hard-coded order of columns (which are actually the default TMF table columns). This you can achieve using methods extractFieldItems() of TmfEventsTable and getColumns() of the TmfVirtualTable instance which is a member of TmfEventsTable. You will need some public methods to access these information and pass a reference to the TmfEventsTable instance as command parameter.""",2

See https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/eclipse-fedorapackager.git/tree/org.fedoraproject.eclipse.packager/src/org/fedoraproject/eclipse/packager/internal/handlers/UploadHandler.java#n71 and https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/eclipse-fedorapackager.git/tree/org.fedoraproject.eclipse.packager/plugin.xml#n227 for sample usage. That way only one handler would be enough.,1
26437,Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1(6 comments)The code does not belong to rpm.ui.editor but to rpm.ui or even rpm.core if it doesn't have UI dependency. I understand that you tried to follow the way things were done but these are legacy errors because in the past everything was in rpm.ui.editor and code is still not refactored to have proper logical structure. We should not make it harder to fix in the future.,1

26657,Patch Set 2:(2 comments)Patch Set 1 shows the simple apprach which tries to minimize the number of cache entries which has to be invalidate after manual mappings changes. Bases on the old value of the ProjectCoordinate a lookup in the cache is made. All entries which are equal to the old value are refreshed. If the old value is absent() (worst case) this means that all absent() entries will be refreshed.Patch Set 2 (As discussed with Andreas) shows the approach using two caches (IPackageFragementRoot --> DependencyInfo and DependencyInfo --> ProjectCoordinate). With this approach we can directly invalidate the affected mapping.What do you think?,1
26658,"""Patch Set 2:(6 comments)I like patch 2 better. Assuming the persistence logic is not really longer than in patch 1, the change is even slightly shorter.Speaking of persistence: I think only the mapping DependencyInfo -> ProjectCoordinate should be persisted.

I installed the example plug-in and the patch and tried File > New > Other...  and got an empty General and an empty General > Folder category being shown.Comments on the change:- I would not add WizardCollectionElementFilter but simply  add the static helper method to WizardCollectionElement- new Javadoc is not complete- @since tag is wrong- make sure to keep #select and #filter in sync (didn't  verify that),1

27044,Patch Set 4:The additional empty category filter also relies on filtering older.

I can't rememeber the exact issue, but because of simplifications in the API, we can no longer infer the generics in the same way we used to.

I think the model is overly complex now with ReviewItemSets, ReviewItems and File items.  Do we really need the ReviewItem element anymore?

And it's also a practical thing because we want to be able to create one-off parent and children changes attached to reviews. These aren't actually changes per se, they're (in Gerrit) simply git references.

29072,Patch Set 5: (8 inline comments)On a high level this looks like a good change. I have voted -2 though since we must not add a dependency on a specific team provider (jgit in this case) to the review framework. I also agree with Miles that passing the repository along through the call chain isn't optimal. I would suggest that we discuss on the bug how to resolve the design issues.A few other things:* @version should be removed. We don't use them in Mylyn since it's easy enough to obtain that from the SCM and they tend to cause weird merge conflicts.* All changed files should have a corresponding copyright note under Contributors in the copyright header section. Files with substantial changes should also have an @author tags.,1

29082,"""Patch Set 8:The code was adapted to work with the new Remotes API that was just merged in.  Basically the functionality is as before and is tested (except for comparing review items which I could not test due to new bug 403389).There is one part missing to resolve the File Revisions when opening a file from the Review Navigator.  Miles I will need your help for this one, see the TODO comments in OpenCompareEditorProvider#init.Right now I use the ReviewBehavior object to pass in the parent repository needed to resolve the file revision from the team repository and the resolution is done when the file is opened in the compare editor.  Ideally, we should add a reference to the repository in the ReviewItemSet model element and a team IFileRevision reference in the Mylyn Review IFileRevision.  This would enable use to decorate the IFileItem icon in the GErrit Task editor and Review Navigator at all times.  However, to make that work, we need a way to detect that the workspace file has changed to redo the resolution when the user changes his workspace (e.g. when checking out another git branch).  This should be investigated and done as part of the effort for bug 371428, which is the evolution of the solution provided here).We should also change the Mylyn Review IFileRevision element name to IFileVersion to avoid confusion with the team API element (see bug 403393)In any case, except for the OpenCompareEditorProvider problem, this is ready for the final review""",1

29161,Patch Set 1:The same infinite recursion happens in IndexCPPTemplateResolutionTest.testConstantPropagationFromHeader,1
29162,"""Patch Set 1:The infinite recursion in both IndexCPPTemplateResolutionTest.testConstantPropagationFromHeader and my test project can be avoided by not marshalling the template definition when serializing EvalFixed. In fact EvalFixed doesn't need to know the template definition since it doesn't do any lookups dependent on it. It probably makes sense to split CPPEvaluation into two classes, one derived from another, with fTemplateDefinition in the derived class. EvalFixed would then be able to derive from a more light-weight superclass.Another change I would suggest is adding a constructor to all evaluations except EvalFixed that takes IASTNode pointOfDefinition parameter. This would allow for making DeferredResolutionBinding a nested class of CPPEvaluation and replacing SemanticUtil.findEnclosingTemplate(IASTNode) by a private method in CPPEvaluation.""",1

For example for EvalBinary it can be written as:public EvalBinary(int operator, ICPPEvaluation arg1, ICPPEvaluation arg2, IASTNode pointOfDefinition) {    this(operator, arg1, arg2, findEnclosingTemplate(pointOfDefinition));}This code assumes that findEnclosingTemplate method is moved to CPPDependentEvaluation class.I saw infinite recursion in IndexCPPTemplateResolutionTest.testConstantPropagationFromHeader when I ran that test in debugger with a breakpoint on StackOverflowError.

The perf tool tip doesn't provide anything meaningful since all tools require installation.  I would prefer you say: """"Note: does not require set-up or special compilation"""" which explains why we chose it as the default.Instead of """"Cache Using"""" for cachegrind which is very awkward I would suggest: """"Cache Usage"""" or """"Cache Reporting"""".For Callgraph, say: """"Note: requires SystemTap to obtain data"""" or something to that effect rather than talking about the SystemTap language.For the ones requiring compilation, I'm not sure whether to include the C/C++ qualifier or not.  They will require rewording if specifying a note: for example, gprof could be worded as:  """"Note: requires compilation of at least one C/C++ source file using """"-pg"""" option."""" possibly leaving out the C/C++ part which is implied by our tools (see next paragraph).This brings up an interesting issue.  Since our tools only support C/C++, should the Profiling preferences and Properties be under the C/C++ Preferences and Properties.  This should not be solved in this patch and would require a separate RFE or bug.For now, I would suggest adding something to the top Profiling page, which currently doesn't have anything on it, to indicate that the preferences are for tools using the Linux Tools profiling framework for C/C++ projects.  This will at least prevent any confusion.The Restore Defaults buttons on all the pages do not operate properly as they set the default to be the first item in any radio group.

For example, OProfile should mention that it requires set-up and/or root access  Gprof should mention that it requires special compile options.

30670,Patch Set 7:Do we need the explicit contributor statement for Markus?,1
30671,Patch Set 7:according to lcp this patch has 275 lines of code so we need to file a CQ here.For all contributions from non-committers we always need the explicit contribution statements as a comment in Gerrit or in Bugzilla as described in [1]. This is also required for small patches < 250 LOC which don't need a CQ.[1] http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#Legal_Paperwork,1
30672,Patch Set 7:Do we really need that? I wrote a big parts of this and only my last addition of test cases brought it over >250 lines. Markus asked in on a comment on patchset 2 from Jul 9 whether somebody wants to take over this change. Since he was the one who found the initial problem I didn't wanted to take over. But if this leads now to a CQ I ask myself:- would it help if I takeover authorship. Markus is ok with that.- would it help if I remove my last testcase additions and add them in a different change.,1
30673,"""Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisI found a bug and fixed it, but I have to do some double-checks with native git before we can accept this bug.That's the problem: During merge we update the index and populate the worktree for some paths. Problem is: it's a long running operation and we want to be able to recover from a failed operation without leaving a corrupted repo/work-tree. E.g. what happens if we have succesfully updated (overwritten) 10000 files but when writing file 10001 this fails and we want to rollback. Therefore we prepare the new index first and if the index was succesfully persisted then we start modifying the work-tree (what we should write in the work-tree can be seen from the new index). Means: we first call indexBuilder.commit() and then we call checkout(). That's wrong because the checkout() provides us with information which have to go into the index. Especially we don't know lastModified and length of a file until we have written it to disk. For lastmodified that's clear. But think about how autocrlf influences length. I changed it now that we first checkout all files (which updates lastModified and length of DirCacheEntries) and then we persist the index. As I said: no sure about whether this is correct and I'll investigate further.""",1

30676,Patch Set 5:Mainly cleaned up the test case and increased the performance of this test. The test contained a lot of sleeps to avoid racily clean index entries. The number of sleeps have been reduced and the test runs faster.I am more confident about this fix because I see that native git also goes the same direction to update the working tree first and the update the index (see http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/jgit-dev/msg01730.html).One leftover is still not completely clear. Are there situations where we have to rollback modified working tree files in case while updating the working tree or the index we run into exceptions (e.g. can't update a locked working tree file),2

30761,"""Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisI like the idea to cleanup certain timestamps during checkout, but we can't do this so blindly. It's wrong to always update the index entry with the timestamp of the associated work-tree file. Sometimes we keep index entries although we know that the filesystem has already been modified. Simply copying the filesystem timestamp would be wrong. Think about this: git init touch f.txt        // lastmodified(f.txt) = m git add f.txt      // timestamp(indexEntry(f.txt)) = m git commit -m initial git checkout -b side touch g.txt git add g.txt git commit -m modified1 sleep 2            // to avoid smudged entries echo x > f.txt     // lastmodified(f.txt) = m + 1 git checkout masterIn the last checkout we want to keep the index entry for f.txt with the timestamp of 'm' although we know that thefilesystem has already 'm + 1'Another issue is that this may be quite expensive (not sure about it). Imagine you have the linux kernel repo with 38000 files. You switch from branch master to develop. Since you have not touched the files we want to keep all 38000 files. And youre change forces us to ask the filesystem 38000 times for a timestamp. Without your change we can completely ignore the filesystem and the index for all those files where the HEAD version and the BRANCH version are equal (BRANCH version is the active version on the branch you want to checkout). I love this feature of git to be able to switch branches without having to check the dirtyness of the index and the working tree for 99% of the files.But: maybe you could check for smudged entries and update only them. If for smudged entries (timestamp=0) the filesystem content is the same as the index content then we could use copy over the filesystem lastmodified date and unsmudge the entry.""",2
30762,"""Patch Set 3:thanks for the review. i'm clearly no expert in this area (not yet ;)), and i knew this approach is (probably) not perfect. if you have ideas on how to do better, please feel free to instruct me (instruct me like a 4 year old, pls ;)) or even take over the change.i can only say about the performance: we have a repo with ~33000 files, and this was the reason i tried to improve the situation: re-indexing took ~5-10 minutes (!), and with this change is down to a few seconds, which is way better. AFAICT, the reading of the filestamp is rather unexpensive (at least compared to not reading it, and re-hashing file contents all the time ;)).if the keep() method is the wrong place, or if more care needs to be taken when to call it with zero (old behaviour) or the current file's timestamp (new behaviour) - i can't tell, but you may tell me, and i'll do my best :)currently i just can say that all unit tests go ok, and that i'm quite satisfied with how /fast/ this makes working with JGit/EGit; it really is approximately 50 times faster in most situations, and i had to wait _a lot_ before.""",2

30796,"""Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisHow does this relate to core.filemode?I was wondering why we don't need this kind of check in other places (e.g. status (decoration), checkout, reset). Why does the decorator in EGit shows the file as non-dirty although the jgit Merger thinks they are dirty?I think that most jgit code respects core.filemode configuration parameter. If set to false jgit will think that differences in executable bits are irrelevant. See WorkingTreeIterator.compareMetadata() to see how executable bits are handled there. Can't we make use of this method also here instead of reinventing the check?Native git on windows has the same problem. Clone jgit on windows with msysgit and afterwards set the configuration parameter core.filemode to true. A git status will tell that the worktree is dirty e.g. because of the filemode of org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst-rsrc/org/eclipse/jgit/test/resources/create-second-pack.If you now try to rebase master on top of another branch msysgit will not start doing this because he thinks the worktree is dirty.

30976,"""Patch Set 10:Content can't change during reading. Or at least it shouldn't. The correct way to modify the config file is to write a new copy of it to config.lock, then atomically rename config.lock to config. Anyone who edits the file in place is just asking to corrupt the file, and/or confuse a concurrent reader.But since this code is opening the file and then later stats it to find the length to estimate the read, and these are both resolving the path down to the inode separately it is possible for the file to change in length if someone renames an updated version in between the two calls.This is low level enough, and used often enough by JGit, that I want it to robustly handle the file size changing when the lock file rename protocol was followed by a concurrent writer. Otherwise servers will fall over periodically when a concurrent writer races against a reader, and the reader will eventually get caught between the two path->inode translations.Go ask Sun why the felt it wasn't necessary to be able to determine the length of an open file from a FileInputStream using the fstat() system call.

31114,"""Patch Set 6: I would prefer that you didn't submit thisI have problems with this. I agree that the display of ORIG_HEAD, FETCH_HEAD and MERGE_HEAD should be avoided for the 99% of the cases. But I would say that they are nearly always important to be displayed when the point to objects which are otherwise unreferenced. My suggestion: By default always show them when they point to something which is not referenced by any other ref. And add a preference which allows me to show them always & never.Here is my argument: Even middle-experienced EGit users start doing rebases quite soon. If I am in the middle of a rebase I sometimes want to compare the state before I started the rebase operation to the current state. Without ORIG_HEAD the state where I startet rebase is lost.Another argument: Even the gerrit Web-UI suggest the usage of FETCH_HEAD. If I just want to look at a specific proposal I want to be able to inspect it locally without having to create and afterwards delete a temporary ref. FETCH_HEAD is perfect for that.You may say: that's your use-case but 99% of the normal users don't work like that and are beeing disturbed by these technical refs. My argument: Fine, if they don't work like that then they will never have ORIG_HEAD,MERGE_HEAD and FETCH_HEAD pointing to something which is otherwise unreferenced. Means: they will not see these refs with the default setting I propose.""",1
31115,"""Patch Set 6:In reply to Christians remarks:I can see the point with respect to the Refs that are not otherwise referenced (users may want to use them during a Rebase, for example). However, this whole thing started out by some colleague (and me) being irritated by exactly such References. You do a Rebase, it finishes, and suddenly you have that ORIG_HEAD thing popping into your face from the HistoryView. Instead of the nice linear history you wanted to achieve by the Rebase, you suddenly have something looking very much like two branches....I think that turning the toggle into some Always/Unreferenced/Never switch would confuse the poor user too much. They would have some branch on a commit and no white label, but once the branch moves to the next commit, the white label would magically appear?So perhaps the solution to this could be to make the Additional Refs visible by default and put a button close to the """"Show All Branches"""" button so that users can more easily suppress the Refs? In other words, invert the flag to mean """"Suppress Additional Refs""""?""",0

I did it in a slightly different way than your suggestion, but I think it makes a little bit more sense given how the data comes into the generator.  Let me know if you see any problems with it.The generator should now return all commits up to the specified depth, ignoring any that were part of commonBase.  But it will correctly start returning any commits below the boundary of a previous shallow checkout, and return all commits at the old boundary as UNINTERESTING so that the PackWriter can exclude the right things from the pack.  As far as I can tell, this is correct behavior in all cases.I couldn't do the SEEN thing like I was planning on doing, because uninteresting commits get the flag set on them as well (as part of markStart()), so sometimes it's already present on commits in our queue even though we haven't added all their parents yet.  I reworked the depth stuff a bit and added some comments, hopefully making it clear enough that the depth sorting accomplishes the same thing.I'm cautiously optimistic that this is getting pretty close.

I had to turn off my reorder commits logic when a shallow clone is being used, because the reordering was packing parent commits that should not have been included in the pack. Not your fault, since the code is newer than the last version you touched in the patch. :-)I think I also busted shallow clone over smart HTTP. The server always crashes with an exception during the exchange, but it works correctly. Smart HTTP clients have an extra intermediate request that the UploadPack code isn't expecting.

This could probably reuse the diff view implementation of Kevin's new commit viewer which has been integrated into the History View context menu yesterday.

For example, I might naively think I have to select all EGit projects to switch to another branch, or in the future, you might want to switch all EGit and JGit projects to the 0.11 branch. Although the branch would be different in each case they have the same name. The entry set could give branches in arbitrary order if I read this correctly. If so, can we sort?The comment in the single arg constrictor has """"default constructor"""" which seems to be a cut and paste from the single arg version.

N=2560000, D=4210, time/(N*D):2E0, time/(N*D^2):4.76E-4   testPatience 1280000 bytes took   3022629000 ns. N=2560000, D=793, time/(N*D):1.49E0, time/(N*D^2):1.88E-3This tells us that Patience diff can be even faster then Myers. But even more interesting to me is the value for D (the size of the found edit-script). PatienceDiff found an 5 times lesser edits than myers. I won't say that smaller edit-scripts (with probably huger regions) are better, but my big hope is that PatienceDiff brings """"better diffs"""" regarding readability by humans. We should have tests with real-world content which proof that. Tests which show better quality of the diffs as listed here: http://bramcohen.livejournal.com/73318.html""",2
32062,"""Patch Set 6: (5 inline comments)FWIW, I'm still not done speeding up PatienceDiff.  I think we can do even better than we are doing right now.  Some of the ideas may even be leveraged back into MyersDiff.  I just haven't thought about doing that yet because its still a big ugly black box to me.Coming up with D=793 on PatienceDiff when MyersDiff comes up with D=4210 is because we are only looking at unique common lines.  When PatienceDiff cannot find a unique line in a region, it just bails and does a giant replace, while MyersDiff continues to look for context.If we plugged in MyersDiff at this point as a fallback, we should get D=4210 again.  But I'm not sure that is the best immediate fallback strategy.  We could instead build a histogram of the common lines and pick the least duplicated common lines and try to find the LCS around those.  By using least duplicated we should still avoid nasty cases like """"\t}\n"""" as being an anchor point for the matching, but would still be able to break out of the degenerate case.Thus far I have done only very limited testing of PatienceDiff on real-world input.  I did wire it into DiffFormatter and run `jgit log -p` to scan through the diffs.  I didn't see any obvious variations from MyersDiff, but I don't think recent JGit history is a poster child for where patience diff is supposed to produce more readable results.In case you didn't know, my motivation behind PatienceDiff was to find another solution to Gerrit issue 487 [1], infinite loop in MyersDiff.  Unfortunately patience diff really fails on single-character sequences (due to insufficient common unique points), but the algorithm is trivially simple and easy to prove that it will terminate.  I'm probably going to try and do a word-level variant of RawText and see if we can get a word-level thing to work better under PatienceDiff for the intraline difference coloring in Gerrit.Also, MyersDiff is really slow for Gerrit.  For some patches it takes 2.5s to display the page.  Of that 2.5s, 2.450s is spent in MyersDiff doing the intraline work.  Getting a faster algorithm under it would be nice.[1] http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=487""",1
32063,"""Patch Set 6:FYI, JGit commit 741659fed4e73b71693b408e137804b17e65f0cb now offers a great example of where PatienceDiff is better than MyersDiff.  In file DeltaStreamTest.java I added a whole new unit test block.  PatienceDiff correctly shows what I did: -		assertTrue(Arrays.equals(data, act)); +		assertTrue(""""bulk read has same content"""", Arrays.equals(data, act)); + +		// Assert that smaller tiny reads have the same result too. +		// +		act = new byte[data.length]; +		in = open(); +		int read = 0; +		while (read < data.length) { +			int n = in.read(act, read, 128); +			if (n <= 0) +				break; +			read += n; +		} +		assertEquals(data.length, read); +		assertEquals(-1, in.read()); +		assertTrue(""""small reads have same content"""", Arrays.equals(data, act));  	}MyersDiff just shows a slop of intermixed add/deletes.

Large binary objects are probably less frequently modified by the user in the working directory, so we're probably less likely to actually need this faster access.  So we might be doing too much work in some cases.But for a gerrit code review server serving large binary files, this really helps, because users of the server tend to access the same objects several times before the next git gc runs.""",1

We could parameterise that to the same function and delegate based on a switch (e.g. fillInFrom(FILE), fillInFrom(STREAM) and then code if( from==FILE)fillInFromFile() else (if from = STREAM) fillInFromStream() so we only need this implementation once. Or, we could pass in a class (FillInSource) and have that delegated to.Either way, I think the duplicate looping logic should be removed so that when there's a future error, we only do it once, and it can be detected appropriately (and means we only have one place to fix in the future).""",1

My opinion is, we're not freezing any APIs until we release 1.0.0.  Until then we may rip up APIs during a 0.x to 0.(x+1) release, so we should scope that way, and anyone linking to us should assume that same risk.Part of the problem I have though is the foundation encourages a 2 year commitment to supporting published APIs.

Equinox DS provides the osgi.extender capability since Neon M4. Now the e4 bundles can specify Require-Capability to that osgi.extender.

33471,"""Patch Set 1:I thought about this a bit more... Remember that the contents of ITmfCallsite date from the original UST-callsite implementation that ended up never being implemented. Also, it works well today because we addr2line to resolve both the source locations and the function names, but those are technically two separate pieces of information (especially since we could move the function-name-getting to something else, like parsing the binary directly, eventually).Here's another suggestion:* Remove (well, deprecate for now) getFunctionName() from ITmfCallsite* Remove the notion of ITmfCallsite from ISymbolProvider. That way ISymbolProvider is only for function/symbol names, as was meant to be initially* Add a new notion of FunctionName in the UstDebugInfo analysis, so we have a clear """"Callsite"""" object for the Source Location aspect, and a function name for the Function Location aspect* Split the methods in FileOffsetMapper, where one query type will return the callsites, and another will return just the function name.

34135,Patch Set 2:(1 comment),1
34136,"""Patch Set 2:(1 comment)Tomek, I think you're exactly right. It looks like we've been getting false positives all along for whether reviews need to be updated or not. As far as I can tell, we'd always be updating reviews. This could explain the rather hyper-active updating we've been seeing. And yeah, we should look at the tests as they seem to be expecting one too many updates. But we need to be careful to test this change in UI as it could have significant consequences. (Note that by default, we simply returned true in all cases for model updates as that is the """"safe"""" strategy -- you shouldn't be able to screw anything up by over-reporting your need for an update but you could by under-reporting it.)""",1
34137,"""Patch Set 2:The plot thickens a bit. Looking further at the code, it appears that what was actually happening was that the false positive was masking a failure to request an update for when reviewer changes occurred. As w/ dependencies, it seems that adding a reviewer may not actually case the modification date to be updated. So I think that isModelUpdated will need to be modified to test that the number of current reviewers matches the number of expected reviewers.At some point this becomes a bit of a performance question, because by the time we make all of the API calls to determine whether an update should occur, we may have made enough calls to actually just go ahead and update the review! So we end up making a number of calls twice. Instead we might look at always returning true here, and checking for deltas in updateModel and returning false if there aren't any. (Right now we just assume that if updateModel is called, that updates have in fact occurred.) But that's a big change and probably not something to consider now.""",1

34342,Patch Set 1:This seem to hurt LT proxy design. I'm not certain how to handle this change too. So lets discuss some ideas.I think it should be designed as:1. Create a new interface org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.IRemoteConnection2. Provides an implementation of IRemoteConnection for local connections (org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.LocalConnection)3. Your RDTConnection goes to package org.eclipse.linuxtools.internal.rdt.proxy. It should implement the IRemoteConnection interface too.4. The method RDTConnection#getConnectionsName goes to org.eclipse.linuxtools.internal.rdt.proxy.RDTProxyManager. Perhaps it should return a list of IRemoteConnection instead of the connections name. Notice that RDTProxyManager has already a getConnection(uri) method5. Finally create a method in org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch.RemoteProxyManager to return either LocalConnection or RDTConnection based upon the URI and/or IProject.Notice that org.eclipse.linuxtools.profiling.launch has already two classes about remote connection: RemoteConnection and RemoteConnectionException. They doesn't fit in current LT proxy design but I am not sure how to deal with it... :(,0

As the EMF implementation of the AOF represents all scalar features as IOnes, and as the IOne interface already provides a default value, it seemed useful to add an """"isDefault"""" API to IOne in order to let clients know when the box's value is defaulted.

35052,"""Patch Set 1:This is a new Gerrit review presenting a variation of change 38587 that fixes the problem of every regeneration of the tests producing code in a new random order, which I discussed on the Papyrus-Dev mailing list. This is accomplished primarily by a verbatim translation of the QVTo transformation steps to Xtend language.  The overall design of the transformation pipeline is the same as before:  in particular, the UML models are the same.  It's just the language in which the transformations are specified that has been changed.Xtend exposes list values in UML models in their native EList terms, which affords stable and predictable ordering of transformation operations and, hence, test model structure and generated code.  It also provides for more concise, debuggable, searchable, and performant transformations with better Java integration.  On the subject of performance:  a comparison of the QVTo version against the equivalent Xtend version, averaged over 5 runs after a couple of warm-ups with the longest run discarded finds that the Xtend version runs more than twice as fast:  49.75 seconds as compared to 117.25 seconds.  This is including the M2T code-generation step that is the same Xtend in both cases and XMI identifier generation which is unique to the Xtend implementation of the UML transformations.  But, to me this is a bonus, not the important factor:  it's the tooling support and stability of the transformation that are most significant.A new UMLWriter workflow component is employed to assign predictable, stable XMI identifiers to elements of generated UML models to avoid unnecessary diffs in source control when re-generating.  (somewhat moot now that the models are no longer in git)This patch set also regenerates the test code from the Xtend version of the framework. I have git-ignored the generated UTP source models because they reference and depend on UML instance models of the GMFGens that are already git-ignored, so there's no point in having these in git.  Besides that they are now much larger because of the generated unique XMI IDs.I welcome any feed-back you may have on the question of whether we should adopt this Xtend-based transformation or continue with the QVTo implementation.  I do want to continue adding more synchronization test cases to complete the coverage of that new capability, so it would be nice to do that only in one or the other variant of the test framework.  ;-)""",2
35053,"""Patch Set 1:Also, I think it's worth noting that the (rather trivial, actually) exercise of translating from QVTo to Xtend picked up some problems that the QVTo language makes it easy to miss.  For example:* strings concatenated accidentally that were supposed to be separated in a list by commas (in the lists of edit-parts to test)* some GMFGen models have one or more GenNodes that don't have a model facet, resulting in stuff silently not happening in QVTo but more noisy with Xtend (requiring action to adapt the transformation logic)""",1
35054,"""Patch Set 4:Patch set 4 reduces the amount of boilerplate code in the Xtend GMFGen-to-UTP transformation considerably and improves readability, by developing a small DSL for declaration of transformation rules for test contexts and assembly into packages.  This uses new active annotations which, owing to a logistical limitation of Xtend, must be defined in a new separate plug-in project.""",1

This employs a class-file scanning hack that is potentially expensive in I/O, so it uses a new @Cached active annotation that caches method computation results.Now the entire code-generation run generates no compilation errors that need to be fixed up afterwards and repeated runs produce no diffs.  The stage is set for completion of the generation of synchronization tests.""",1

The factory class would checkif a matching hook script can be found, if not it would simply return null to signalthere's no hook installed. If a matching hook script is found the factory returnsan instance of the hook class.The code needed to execute the hook script could be encapsulated in the hook classand the JGit commands don't need to know that the hook implementation is a script.So instead of if (!noVerify && FS.DETECTED.findHook(repo, Hook.COMMIT_MSG) != null) { .... lengthy execution code polluting jgit commands ... }we could write something like if (!noVerify) {        CommitMessageHook hook = factory.findCommitMessageHook(repo);        if (hook != null) {               hook.execute(parameters needed for execution);        } }Visibility of the Hook enum can then probably be reduced to package visibility.if we go for this approach we should also change the implementation of pre-commit hook accordingly""",1

35569,Patch Set 3:Have you thought about adding your hook support to a more generic place? All your hooks are implemented in the jgit/api package. But users of JGit are not forced to use this package. If components like gerrit or gitblit use jgit on a more low-level (but still public) level than they would have no hooks support. E.g. look at RepoCommand.java. They creating commits with CommitBuilder and ObjectInserter but they would have no hooks support. Maybe somewhere in ObjectInserter.insert(CommitBuilder) would be a good place. But we have to take care that we don't call hooks for commits which come in e.g. through transport.,1
35570,"""Patch Set 3:No, I have not considered it :). The right place for me was in the commands themselves, I didn't really think further ahead...I don't think the hooks have their place in such low-levels though... Someone who wishes to use the ObjectInserter directly probably doesn't want external processes to kick-in... not to mention the hooks themselves expect to be run in a particular environment; most notably, in an environment where the repository isn't locked (.git/index.lock doesn't exist). A hook (for example, post-commit) could very well checkout another branch, copy create a copy of the commit there, then re-checkout the original branch. On the other hand, CommitBuilder shouldn't be used without having locked the repo beforehand IIUC.Likewise, the pre-commit hook can """"block"""" a commit entirely, which wouldn't be possible without some hickups if done too low-level : the CommitCommand, RebaseCommand, CherrypickCommand... or anything called by EGit might setup some preparation on the repository before calling the lower level ObjectInserter... but if the hook rejects the commit, all of this setup is not only useless but needs to be reverted.I'll try and pull them down a few level if you think that's necessary, but I don't really know how to do it cleanly.""",1

35758,"""Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1(4 comments)This review is so big that it breaks Gerrit  :-)The subject at hand is ostensibly integration of MWE2 workflow execution and Xtend compilation for the oep.infra.gmfdiag.css plug-in, but there are a great many files changed in other unrelated plug-ins (just line endings or encoding changed?).  Also, the CSS plug-in itself was renamed/refactored, resulting in lots of files moved.  Why?  This makes it very difficult to review the change.Can we take this a step at a time, starting by just factoring out the specific releng changes needed for integration of MWE2 and Xtend into the build for this plug-in?  Also, I thought the purpose overall was to provide some shared POM that would make it easy to integrate MWE2 and Xtend into any plug-in.

Why not in this case?  Or are we free now to introduce more POM hierarchy for other purposes?  That would be fine with me; I just thought that was not currently policy.  Also, I'm concerned that we're adding POM files that aren't maintained within the Eclipse projects and are therefore not easily managed within the Eclipse environment (they are only accessible in the Git directories).  For example, there isn't a plugins/infra/gmfdiag/css/xtext/.project file to create an Eclipse project that makes the pom.xml accessible within Eclipse.Any comment on the site.xml and xdoc files that look like auto-generated stubs?  AFAIK, we don't use these in Papyrus.  And all of the files that are changed in plug-ins that aren't generated?What I was hoping to see was common infrastructure that I could re-use in my own Xtend projects to simplify their build configuration (which, granted, isn't exactly complex:  the xtend-maven-plugin is quite simple).

Isn't the full range just a special case of the zoomed events? And doesn't that complicate the whole thing uselessly?

And doesn't that complicate the whole thing uselessly? Is it just to cache to full range data because we suppose it may be used more than once, while each zoom range is pretty much unique?There are two reasons for the two lists. One is that when you zoom out completely (a common case) the list is already available. The other is that when you scroll and zoom out you have 'some' level of detail before you settle on a new window range and the new zoomed list is computed. Otherwise everything outside of the old window range would be completely blank, and you would be scrolling 'in the dark' (e.g. when you drag the scroll bar thumb).I can see two cases where you only need one list. First is if you know that your data is small enough, you can have only the full list computed without any resolution gaps, then you don't need any zoomed list. The second is if you want to have only the current window visible data, then you can avoid the full range list -- with the caveat explained above (note that in this case, setting the zoom range to null when zooming to full range would be a bad idea...).""",1

Unfortunately, there is nobody working full time on p2, and I am not very familiar with the codebase you touched.I would deeply appreciate if you could tell me what is the effect of skipping certain notifications - your patch removes NPE but it would be good to know that it fixes the real problem, not just hiding it.""",2
35911,"""Patch Set 1:Daniel,the underlying problem is that notifications occur before the initialization of the variables ÔÇ£artifactReposForRemovalÔÇØ and ÔÇ£metadataReposForRemovalÔÇØ has been completed. It is a timing issue as far as I can say, as the NPEÔÇÖs does not happen all the time. And if the NPEÔÇÖs occur, everything is installed/uninstalled just fine, except that the users get a little bit worried as there are exceptions in the install log.If you look at DirectorApplication#run (line 1080 and following), ÔÇ£initializeServices()ÔÇØ is called at line 1088 which does register the provisioning event bus listener at the end of that method. At this point of time, ÔÇ£initializeRepositories()ÔÇØ (called at line 1095) hasnÔÇÖt been called yet and therefore both variables are still null. If there is an incoming notification before ÔÇ£initializeRepositories()ÔÇØ is fully processed, you run in the NPE. Once ÔÇ£initializeRepositories()ÔÇØ is called, the notifications are processed without triggering an NPE.The proposed fix is the simplest approach without changing the original control flow of the DirectorApplication. Obviously it would be also possible to do the registration of the provisioning event bus listener after the call to ÔÇ£initializeRepositories()ÔÇØ, but this will modify the control flow of the DirectorApplication slightly. IÔÇÖm open for any suggestion and can also provide a patch that moves the provisioning event bus registration after ÔÇ£initializeRepositories()ÔÇØ.""",1
35912,Patch Set 1:Thank you for the answer. Do you think it would be possible to run initialization if it has not been already done instead of null checking?I get a little bit nervous about letting the notification being skipped in certain circumstances.,0
35913,"""Patch Set 2:Daniel,I've uploaded a new patch set that moves the initialization of the listeners to earliest possible point where the two variables are initialized. With the """"notify"""" method assuming that the two variables are initialized, the provisioning event bus listener should not be installed before the initialization of the variables is completed.Calling initRepositories() from notify() in the case the variables are found null is probably not a good idea as the initRepositories() call throws exceptions during the initialization. Moving the exception handling also to the notify() method is probably a bit to much?""",1

So you would add this open source module to your build.However you don't want to run the open source test cases as they would fail in the custom environment but you still want to execute the extended version so you don't want to skip al tests either.So the option is to simple skip the test cases for the tests.dsf.gdb bundle and leave it on for other tests bundles.

36042,"""Patch Set 1:Hi J Langley,First, thanks for the contribution!   Your patch looks excellent.  I think we should easily be able to get this incorporated into ECF 3.9.1.A few very minor comments:1) For the ScpBrowseFileTransferFactory class:  Is there any need to have this class be in a new (and exported) package org.eclipse.ecf.provider.filetransfer.scp?  Unless you already know that this class is going to be accessed by some other bundle, I would prefer that it be placed in the existing internal package:  org.eclipse.ecf.internal.provider.scp.  That way, the scp provider code would all be exposed by internal-only packages...and this browse edition would be consistent with the retrieve and send classes (which are in the internal package now).2) If you move the ScpBrowseFileTransferFactory class into the internal package, it would make it unnecessary to export a new package in the manifest.mf.  For maintenance, it would be nice for us to continue to not export any non-internal packages.I can make the following changes if you wish...just wanted to include them in public review:3) The Bundle-Version in the manifest should be updated from 2.0.100.qualifier to 2.1.0.qualifier (minor revision because of new functionality).4) In org.eclipse.ecf.internal.provider.filetransfer.scp.ScpFileSystemBrowser there are a couple of commented lines:		// FIXME - This code is from ScpOutgoingFileTransfer, but it throws		// exceptions		// if (scpUtil != null) {		// scpUtil.sendZeroToStream(outputStream);		// scpUtil.checkAck(inputStream);		// }Probably best just to remove these lines...unless they are needed for the browse.But overall things look great.  I will fix 3 and 4 prior to commit if you prefer.

36238,"""Patch Set 1:A further change in how Model Explorer manages refresh, to avoid recalculating the entire tree structure on every model edit, which doesn't scale well on large models.First, the Model Explorer's resource-set listener now only schedules structural refreshes for the specific objects that notified changes.Second, the UMLLabelProvider fires LabelProviderChangedEvents to trigger label updates for elements that derive their labels from other related elements, when those related elements are changed.  This required a new mix-in interface for label providers in the Label Provider Service to allow Model Explorer and other clients to pass notifications to them on changes in the model.  I'm not entirely happy with this solution, but it does address a couple of issues with the approach I would rather have taken, which is having individual label providers listen for model changes themselves:  * the providers registered with the Label Provider Service aren't initialized with a    ResourceSet, ServicesRegistry, or other context in which they can find the    model to listen to  * providers could discover, as they are asked to provide labels, the objects they    need to listen to.  But should they be Adapters or ResourceSetListeners?  And    can we be sure that they won't leak, that the providers will be disposed at the    right time so that they can remove listeners/adapters?  * only the Model Explorer (for now) needs label providers to trigger updates.    Element-picker dialogs and other widgets in the Properties view, for example,    don't have this need, so this design ensures that the large number of other    UMLLabelProviders that are created (there are lots) don't all listen for model    changes    I am willing to explore this alternative further if reviewers agree that the new IDependentLabelProvider interface isn't a great thing.Another point that I'm not sure about is the changes in the SemanticUMLContentProvider to prevent addition/removal of stereotype applications from a resource triggering complete refresh of the Model Explorer.  I don't know in what contexts this might break some UI that depends on that refresh trigger.  The consequence of reverting the SemanticUMLContentProvider changes is only that applying/unapplying stereotypes results in a long lag in the UI on large models as the Model Explorer refreshes itself.  This may be acceptable; comment is welcome.""",1
36239,"""Patch Set 2:I've updated the change set to remove the IDependentLabelProvider that I didn't like.  Instead, now the UMLLabelProvider is a service that acts as a subordinate of the LabelProviderService.  When instantiated as a service, it uses a new UMLLabelDependenciesService to efficiently listen for changes in the resource set and compute objects that need to have labels updated.  When not installed as a service (which is also commonly the case), then none of this machinery is engaged.I like this better because it doesn't introduce new API and lets the label provider take care of its own concerns, which is as it should be.""",2

The JUnitBenchmark library looks very interesting at a first glance. However, in my opinion we should delay this patch to RMF 0.9.0, because:(1) the patch using JUnitBenchmarks requires at least junit 4.9. However, the current RMF target platform includes version 4.8.2 (which is part of the Eclipse JDT v.3.7.2). Plese note: Our current build is still based on eclipse 3.7 (indigo). Nevertheless, the orbit update site includes junit 4.10, which could be used as well.@ Fran├ºois: Do you use the RMF indigo target development definition?(2) Our plan is to build RMF 0.9.0 on top of Kepler. The Kepler update site includes a newer version of JDT as well as a newer version of Junit.(3) I guess, that the JUnitBenchmark library is not part of the Eclipse Orbit Project. As a consequence, we need a CQ for the library, especially for the customized version for working with OSGI. I think this should be no problem, since the library is only for testing/benchmark purposes.I will create a new bug entry covering this discussion.""",2

With this patch applied, you end up on a blank page since there is no ?redirect param.Also the change to LoginWindow.js for the case when redirect===null assumes that Orion is running at the server root, which is not always true. eg. if Orion happens to be running at http://myserver/what/lol then it would generate a link to """"http://myserver"""", which is incorrect.I'm not sure what the correct fix is here. I think UserMenu.js needs to keep calling getAuthForm(url) to provide the redirect, but maybe `url` should always be the location of index.html, which would prevent any  user-specific information in the page URL from being preserved across logins. But (as usual, sigh) UserMenu.js isn't supposed to know about specific page URLs since they're contributed dynamically through plugins.So I guess we have to designate a special orion.page.link extension as giving the URL of the index page, add the extension to pageLinksPlugin.js, then lookup that extension from UserMenu.js to obtain the index page URL.Anyone have a better idea? :-|""",1

Wim, no my extension point can not be used like this, as he adds a tab the the overall edtitor, while the vertical extention point adds it to the single elements in the tree.(+) I think it is very interesting, and provides means to solve a few problems. I also like the possiblity to have a list instead of the tree.(-)It breaks with the consistent Eclipse usage one is used to. That is, e.g. the feature to mark duplicate ids should be embedded more Eclipse style s.t. it integrates into the problems view etc. I like the feature to jump to the entries in the tree and the source, again, this should be solved the eclipse way. Repair and Mark should be applicable to the tree.The argument requirement org.eclipse.e4.tools.modeleditor.utilitytab.enabled is a no go.I like the patch, I don't like that it breaks with the way one is used to use Eclipse and I think the functionality embedded should be integrated in other ways.

Then you can easily get the file from the editor input. Or the TmfTraceManager could return the file directly.Note that if you are using the TimeChartView, you can already get the bookmarks file from the TimeChartDecorationProvider associated with the trace. It is stored when the trace is opened from the signal's getBookmarksFile(), or when the view is opened from the editor's getBookmarksFile().

Smaller patches means it's easier to review, easier to bisect, revert if needed, etc., but more importantly, it really shows the logical progression and tells the reviewers where they should be looking at first.I think this could be easily split in:* Add the """"xychart"""" package and the base TmfXYChartViewer, as well as the dependencies in the manifest* Add the TmfBarChartViewer and its related classes (they could go in a xychart.barchart package, but it doesn't really matter.)* Add the tracing.examples plugin, with its settings (but no contents)* Add the NewHistogramView(I myself still have many huge patches I will try to break down in the next couple days, like the null-annotations one.)I like the notion of an """"examples"""" plugin, it's very useful for prototyping, but can serve as kind of staging for """"real"""" views.

37476,"""Patch Set 1:Right. I agree with you in general re: putting behaviour into the model. This is actually a bit of a new approach for me as I generally avoid EOperations. Some factors that weighed in for me:1. I needed somewhere to put the logic outside of UI and make it sharable across multiple usages. We could build a command infrastructure, but that's what EMF edit is for. But it's too ambitious to put in edit support yet.2. This is a special easy to justify case in that a) the behaviour is purely structural and b) occurs at object creation time. Here it is just a case of ensuring that changes create consistent reasonable state for the newly contained objects.""",1

37782,"""Patch Set 1:The pack is normally closed when the last window to it is evicted from the WindowCache.This eviction occurs one of two ways:The first is by the weak LRU popping the least-recently-used window in order to release resources to keep the cache under the byte or open file limits. As these windows are popped the open window count on PackFile gets decreased, and the file is closed when the count drops to 0.The second is when WindowCache spins the ReferenceQueue. If the JVM GC killed some of our SoftReferences in order to free up heap memory WindowCache will (eventually) spin those now dead references out and decrement the open window count on the associated PackFile. When the count drops to 0, the file is closed.I just made a patch to C Git today that doesn't keep the file open if there is exactly 1 window on it. This might be useful in JGit too, but less so because the default window size is so much smaller (8 Kib in JGit). So it might not be worth my time to try and do.Are you seeing file leaking or something Chris?
